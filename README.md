# Analysis of Covid-19 papers - Distributed Processing with DASK

Final project for the "Management add Analysis of Physics Dataset" course at Unipd during 2020/2021.

### Description

The object of this project is to exploit parallel computing using DASK framework in order to analyze a lot of Covid19 papers.

We managed also to create a parallel computing cluster on a cloud resource (given by Physics department of UniPD) named **CloudVeneto**, instantiating some virtual machines.

As transmission became out of control, Lockdown implemented majorly affected countries. Lockdown stage and implemented shutdowns of industries, etc., exhibited a significant reduction in carbon emissions. Carbon emissions are often associated with burning waste, fossil fuels, crude, coal, etc., and it is harmful to the environment and human survival globally. In this chapter, carbon emission data (fossil carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission data) have been collected and comparison has been done during lockdown with last year's data. The comparison showed that emission reduced to a greater extent even more than 50% in some regions. Learnt lessons are evaluated thoroughly in this chapter that can be directed by government and private organizations post lockdown in future. The data presented in this chapter indicated a daily decrease of CO 2 emission by 17% due to complete lockdown in most of the world population. As in most of the region, the lockdown has been upholding the A. Dasgotra \u00b7 S. Manna (B) \u00b7 S. M. Tauseef A.

Due to strict restriction of human activities and shutdown of industrial production different countries are facing economic slowdown. Reports indicated that due to lesser energy consumption and industrial production world GDP reduced by up to 30% [16] . Though, the COVID-19 based crisis reduced the global GDP, it has a positive impact on our environment. As human activities are restricted, fossil CO 2 emission also decreased significantly. Data from the satellite observations and estimated CO 2 emission from power plants suggested that we might be witnessing the largest drop in CO 2 emission since the end of the Second World War. Though the exact data of CO 2 emission during COVID-19 crisis would be available only after the analysis of global inventories of fuel and energy use in the lag of coming one or two years [4, 8, 11, 18] . To give a quick idea about the impact of CO 2 emission related to COVID-19 crisis, International Energy Agency provides an assessment of monthly fossil fuel energy demand in their report. They indicate around 5% decreases in the fuel energy demands by the period of Jan-Apr 2020. In their recent report, Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. [12] also introduced a big step for compiling governmental policies and activity data to monitor decline in CO 2 emission during the forced confinement. Their reports indicated 17% decreases in the daily global CO 2 emission level by the end of April 2020 than the data available for April 2019.",

Also, the precise data difference due to holidays during those confinement time periods. Inclusion of these variations in the emission could improve the understanding of exact CO 2 emission-related data corresponding to COVID-19 related confinement. Thus, day-to-day inventories and baseline data for 2019 and the confinement period of 2020 should be monitored as this data would be critical for estimating CO 2 emission dynamics. For this, Liu et al. [14] constructed inventories on near real time emission on daily, monthly, and seasonal variation both for a period of Jan-May 2020 and Jan-May 2019. Their monitoring also included holidays to ward off related emission declined.

            "text": "Anthropogenic activities are the major source of CO 2 emission and greenhouse effects. There are six major economic sectors which emit CO 2 and cause major changes to our environment. Those six sectors are (1) industry which includes all types of industrial activities, (2) power sectors which include the fossilized fuel burning-based power generation, (3) public and commercial buildings, (4) surface transport which includes both road and water transport, (5) residential, and (6) aviation [12] . Among these six sectors the power generation sectors emit majority of the global fossil fuel-based CO 2 . Around 44.3% of total global CO 2 emission is accounted to fossil fuel-based CO 2 emission. As till date, fossilized fuel burning is the major power source throughout the planet. The industrial sectors are accounted for around 22.4% global CO 2 emission. Among all the industries the cement producing industries account for 8% of global CO 2 emission [7, 9, 10] . The next major sector is surface transport which accounted almost 20.6% of total global CO 2 emission that includes the road, rail, and water transports where the fossil fuel is used as an energy source. The public sectors and the residential sectors emit 4.2% and 5.6% of global CO 2 , respectively. The aviation sector is accounted for 2.8% of global CO 2 emission. In Fig. 8 .2 the sector wise global CO 2 emission share has been presented. Although, the above sector wise global CO 2 emission scenario is general and account to the global level of CO 2 emission. These could be different from country to country Sector wise global CO 2 emission (redrawn using data from [12]) and state to state level as some countries are using less fossil fuel and some are using higher for power generation. Thus, country specific sector wise date would be different than the global level of sector wise CO 2 emission. For example, in China around 22.2% of industrial CO 2 emission is accounted for cement producing industry [13] .",

However, despite it is critically important, systems are not sufficient for monitoring real time CO 2 emission [12] . Currently, CO 2 emission data released either early or monthly and most often after the end of the calendar year. Regardless of this, some representative near-real time date at monthly interval. Some countries use the data of fossil fuel use at the monthly level for monitoring CO 2 emission that is usually released by monthly interval later [1, 6] . Although, nearreal time observation of atmospheric CO 2 is monitored, large variability in carbon cycle and meteorology could mask the anthropogenic variability in short period [2, 19] . Satellite measurement of real-time CO 2 emission also could be done. However, large uncertainties and variability in natural CO 2 fluxes interfere in determining the near-real time anthropogenic CO 2 emission [5, 20] . Recently, Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. [12] have proposed an alternative approach for monitoring country-level CO 2 nearreal time CO 2 emission. They devise a confinement index to monitor the extent of different policies in the CO 2 emission. They divided into four level of confinement as described in the following paragraph. They monitored the changes in CO 2 emission with respect to the changes in anthropogenic activities. ",

However, this lockdown situation opens a new window for reviving of our environment [15] . This pandemic showed that even a small change in few anthropogenic activities could improve the environmental condition. In their recent report, Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. [12] showed that changes in activities could actually have a major effect on the anthropogenic CO 2 emission. Their study indicated that sector wise CO 2 emission was highly dependent on the changes in the corresponding activities. Figure 8 .3 showed the overall activity change during the COVID-19 pandemic and also showed the country wise activity change for a confinement level 3. Figure 8 .3 indicated that change in anthropogenic activities has a direct relation with the CO 2 emission. For level 3 types of confinement index--complete lockdown affected the aviation sectors majorly. During the complete lockdown situation due to COVID-19 in most of the countries completely banned the international and domestic airways. Thus, the CO 2 emission is also found to be lower for aviation sector among the other sectors. In most of the countries fossil fuels are being used for surface transport both for road or water. Thus, at level 3 confinement CO 2 emission from the surface transport sector should be decreased. As expected, Fig. 8 .3 followed same trend for the surface transport sector. Power and public sectors also followed the same trends. Industries are one of the most CO 2 emitting sectors thus during complete lockdown less CO 2 emission was recorded from this sector. Figure 8 .3 clearly indicates that the sector that faced major shutdown showed less CO 2 emission during the critical period of COVID-19 based lockdown.",

The near-real time data shown with the inset figure showed that from January 2020 to May 2020 the CO 2 emission follows the decreasing trends. Complete banned in surface transport and industrial activities leads to a lower power consumption and production. Till now fossil fuel is the major contributing factor for global energy production thus in the level 3 type of confinement the fossil CO 2 emission decreased. As researchers and policy makers are still trying to find a suitable process for restriction of fossil CO 2 emission, strict confinement could be an alternative. However, this type of confinement is closely related to countries financial growth thus proper policy in this matter is necessary to execute it. ",

Also, it was noticed that in April China's CO 2 emission rises up to 0.8% than the same period of time in 2019 after the lockdown confinement was less [14] .

Due to COVID-19 related confinement and corresponding restriction over sector-wise activities, CO 2 emission decreased for all six economic sectors especially in aviation and surface transport. Policy change in this sector could be helpful to cut CO 2 emissions even after the lockdown erased. Many cities already dedicated street space for safe mobility to pedestrian and cyclist that eventually will change the CO 2 emission status of those cities. However, follow up monitoring would improve our understanding on impact of such policy change in CO 2 emission. Emissions from other sectors like industry especially cement production industries, decreased noticeably after lockdown implementation. Also, early implementation of confinement showed early decrease of CO 2 emission. The monitoring of country level CO 2 emission indicated that the emission started decreasing rapidly only after the implementation of lockdown.

A month later the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified a new beta-coronavirus (SARS coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) as the aetiological agent. 1 The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range from asymptomatic infection or mild, transient symptoms to severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure. As many patients do not progress to severe disease the overall case fatality rate per infected individual is low, but hospitals in areas with significant community transmission have experienced a major increase in the number of hospitalised pneumonia patients, and the frequency of severe disease in hospitalised patients can be as high as 30%. [2] [3] [4] The progression from prodrome (usually fever, fatigue and cough) to severe pneumonia requiring oxygen support or mechanical ventilation often takes one to two weeks after the onset of symptoms. 2 The kinetics of viral replication in the respiratory tract are not well characterized, but this relatively slow progression provides a potential time window in which antiviral therapies could influence the course of disease. In May 2020 a new COVID-associated inflammatory syndrome in children was identified, Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome -Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). 5 A rapid NHS England-led consensus process identified the need to evaluate corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) as initial therapies in PIMS-TS, and confirmed tocilizumab as one of the biological anti-inflammatory agents to be evaluated as a second line therapy.",

Common to severe cases of these infections is the presence of hypercytokinemia (a cytokine 'storm') and development of acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). [13] [14] [15] [16] Pathologically, diffuse alveolar damage is found in patients who die from these infections. 17 A growing volume of clinical trial data from patients with severe community acquired pneumonia, ARDS and septic shock suggest benefit from low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids in relation to mortality and length of stay. [18] [19] [20] In trials of low-to-moderate doses of corticosteroids, the main adverse effect has been hyperglycaemia. 19, 21 A systematic review of (mainly low-dose) corticosteroid trials in severe sepsis and septic shock did not identify any increased risk of gastroduodenal bleeding, superinfection or neuromuscular weakness; an association with an increased risk of hyperglycaemia (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25) and hypernatraemia (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.06) was noted. 22 Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. It is used in the treatment of conditions in which rapid and intense corticosteroid effect is required. Its licensed indications for paediatrics include a wide range of conditions including inflammatory disorders, allergic disorders, draft rejection reactions, severe erythema multiforme, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and many others. In the paediatric population, a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 1 g/day for up to 3 days is recommended in the treatment of graft rejection reactions following transplantation. A higher dosage of 30 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 1 g/day for up to 3 days is recommended for the treatment of haematological, rheumatic, renal and dermatological conditions (Source: British National Formulary for Children). Storage should be as per conditions in the Summary of Product Characteristics.",

In addition, mAbs may have additional effector functions (antibody dependent phagocytosis and cytotoxicity) through binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expressed on the surface of cells. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralizing mAbs have demonstrated in vivo efficacy in both therapeutic and prophylactic settings in mouse, and non-human primates models, with decreases in viral load and lung pathology. 2, 46, 47 Regeneron has developed 2 non-competing, high-affinity human IgG1 anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs, REGN10933 and REGN10987 that bind specifically to the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, blocking viral entry into host cells. 48, 49 REGN10933 and REGN10987 are both potent neutralizing antibodies that block the interaction between the spike protein and its canonical receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. REGN10933 and REGN10987 are intended to be utilized as a combination treatment, known as REGN-COV2, and should not be used individually as monotherapy. A combination of antibodies that bind to non-overlapping epitopes may minimize the likelihood of loss of antiviral activity due to naturally circulating viral variants or development of escape mutants under drug pressure. In animal studies (rhesus macaques and hamsters) the antibody cocktail (REGN10933+REGN10987) reduced virus load in lower and upper airway and decreased virus induced pathological sequelae when administered prophylactically or therapeutically. 50",

A recent Cochrane meta-analysis on this topic included seventy-seven trials (40,249 women) taking aspirin at doses between 60 and 150mg daily. 61 In most trials, aspirin was started from 12 weeks' gestation, although a more recent meta-analysis has reported eight trials (1426 women) in which aspirin was initiated in the first trimester. 62 In light of the clear evidence of effectiveness, 75-150mg aspirin is recommended for preeclampsia prophylaxis in NICE guidelines for management of hypertension in pregnancy (NG133), and in the NHS England document 'Saving Babies' Lives for women at increased risk of placental dysfunction disorders. 63, 64 There is some ongoing uncertainty as to the optimal dose (75mg vs. 150mg) for pre-eclampsia prophylaxis, but both doses are in widespread clinical use in pregnancy in the UK for these indications and in other conditions (e.g. in pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome).",

The days of ARS within each critical care episode are assumed to be continuous. The days of ARS were assumed to include randomisation if the participant was recorded as receiving IMV at baseline on the first or second randomisation eCRF as appropriate. Otherwise, the days of ARS are assumed to start from admission to critical care, occur at the mid-point of the critical care admission or end on discharge from critical care depending on the level of care recorded on admission and discharge and, in some cases, the destination on discharge (Appendix 3). Using these assumptions, the information from both ICNARC and the CCDS were used to identify whether IMV was received on each of the 28 days following randomisation.

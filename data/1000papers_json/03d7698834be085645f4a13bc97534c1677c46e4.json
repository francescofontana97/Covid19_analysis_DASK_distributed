Among these substances, PM is the most widespread health threat in cities (Singh 1995; Block and Calder\u00f3n-Garcidue\u00f1as 2009; Allen 2015) . PM is a heterogeneous mixture of suspended liquid droplets and solid particles with various size, shape, and chemical features, with spatial-temporal variations that are present in the ambient urban air (Potukuchi and Wexler 1995; Pope III, Ezzati et al. 2009; Janssen, Hoek et al. 2011 ). Ambient PM is categorized into various size fractions; coarse particles with diameter \u2265 2.5 \u00b5m and \u226410 \u00b5m (PM 10 ); fine particles with diameter \u2264 2.5 \u00b5m (PM 2.5 ); PM 10 that is the sum of the coarse and fine PM, and the ultrafine particles with diameter \u2264 0.1 \u00b5m (PM 0.1 ) (Block and Calder\u00f3n-Garcidue\u00f1as 2009; Khan, Hamid et al. 2019; Zoran, Savastru et al. 2019) . PM contains various substances including metals, elemental and organic carbon, sulfates, and nitrates (Ghio, Carraway et al. 2012; Wooding, Ryu et al. 2019) . It has been reported that increasing pollutant concentrations are associated with more daily confirmed COVID-19 positive cases and the related mortality rate increases (Contini and Costabile 2020; Domingo and Rovira 2020; Wu, Nethery et al. 2020) . Coccia 2020 has highlighted the key role of the air pollutants in the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and reported that the quick and global spread of COVID-19 may be associated with days with PM 10 concentration higher than the EU daily threshold value of 50 \u00b5g/m 3 (Coccia 2020) . Recently in an experimental study, Setti, Passarini et al. 2020 demonstrated that the RNA of the virus can be present on ambient atmospheric PM in stable atmospheric condition and high levels of PM 10. This result suggests that PM concentrations can be used as an indicator for a high potential for infection (Setti et al. 2020) . Additionally, Martelletti and Martelletti (2020) reported that areas in northern Italy with high PM 10 and PM 2.5 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f concentrations had the most COVID-19 affected individuals. Therefore, they expressed that the COVID-19 may find appropriate transport vectors among airborne particles.",

Considering the rapid spread of COVID-19, it seems that there are multiple pathways for the transmission of the virus including airborne pathways. The WHO defines airborne route as \"the spread of an infectious agent caused by the release of droplet nuclei, which, if suspended in the air, remain infected for long distances and times (WHO, 2014) . Based on this definition, it may be that besides human-to-human transmission, other routes especially airborne transmission may be important and involved in the transmission of the COVID-19 (Hadei, Hopke et al. 2020) . Additionally, it is reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be found in indoor air samples in hospitals (Kenarkoohi, Noorimotlagh et al. 2020; Liu, Ning et al. 2020; Razzini, Castrica et al. 2020; Wang, Feng et al. 2020 ) and in crowded government offices and public transport vehicles (e.g., bus or subway) (Hadei et al., 2021) . A systematic review based on the peer-reviewed studies suggested the possibility of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the indoor air environment (Noorimotlagh, Jaafarzadeh et al. 2020) . Therefore, to better understand and clarify the possibility of airborne transmission, the present study has reviewed the literature to investigate the role and potential association of air pollution especially particulate matter pollution in the transmission of COVID-19.",

At the beginning of the disease, all official and authority centers were focused on prevention procedures such as observing social distance, hand washing, avoiding the touch of In addition to serving as a transport vector, exposure to PM may also enhance the susceptibility to viral infections. Interquartile range increases in PM 2.5 over the previous 7 days were associated with increased excess rates (ERs) of influenza emergency department visits (3.9%; 95% CI, 2.1-5.6%). They also found that although PM 2.5 concentrations had substantially decreased in recent years (2014-16) relative to the 2005-07 period, the ER had increased in the recent period. They attributed the increase to increased formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) due to the increased availability of oxidative species because of the reduction in SO 2 and NOx emissions over this time period. In a follow-up analysis, Croft et al. (2020) found that increased rates of ED visits for influenza were associated with interquartile range increases in concentrations of source specific PM 2.5 from light-duty gasoline vehicles (excess rate [ER] = 9.2%; 95% CI: 4.3%, 14.3%) and heavy-duty diesel vehicles (ER = 3.9%; 95% CI: 1.1%, 6.8%) for lag days 0\u22123. They suggested that since the gasoline vehicles were strongly correlated with SOA and diesel PM is known to have substantial oxidative potential (e.g., Cheung et al., 2009) , it is the ability of reactive particles to induce oxidative stress and systemic inflammation that enhanced the infectiousness of the virus (Hopke, 2015) . Thus, it may be that some of the differences in the effectiveness of PM in transmitting the virus may result from differences in composition among the various locations.",

However, the opposite evidence has been published. For example, in Lombardy and Piedmont, the association between PM 10 concentrations and infections were analyzed to correlate high PM levels and SARS-CoV-2. The cities of Turin and Alessandria, which suffered from high PM 10 concentrations during the 20 days before the health crisis, were found to have fewer infections (0.01 and 0.03, respectively). However, in Bergamo, where the limit of 50 \u03bcg/m 3 for PM 10 concentrations was only rarely exceeded, the highest number of infections were found even though RNA was found in the ambient PM 10 (Setti et al., 2020b) . Data on PM 10 concentrations and cases of infection in Lombardy and Piedmont were analyzed and showed that there was no direct association between the presence of high levels of PM 10 and the spread of the virus. As a result, PM 10 concentrations in northern Italian cities could not be directly related to COVID-19 contamination (Bontempi 2020) . It may be that particle size and/or compositions were not favorable for the viability of the virus on the particles even though RNA was clearly found in the ambient PM (Setti et al., 2020b) .",

It was also emphasized that the polluted cities in the hinterland with low lethality has been reported. The opposite is true for areas in the south. Given the effects of air quality on the prevalence of COVID-19, some recent research has shown that people who are exposed to long-term air pollution are more likely to become infected with the SARS-CoV-2 (Conticini, Frediani et al. 2020 ). It has been determined that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the release of infectious airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing or through nuclei with small aerodynamic diameters (Kutter, Spronken et al. 2018) . In general, droplets larger than 50 \u00b5m immediately fall to the ground, while particles with dimensions of 5 \u00b5m take more than an hour to reach the ground from a height of 3 meters (Tellier 2009 ). Besides, particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2 \u00b5m are suspended in the air for hours or days and are more likely to reach the alveolar regions of the lungs (Wong and Lai 2004) . In research done in Wuhan, China, they detected SARS-CoV-2 in particles with 0.25-1.0 \u03bcm diameter and, also another study has detected the virus in 1-4 \u03bcm particles (Liu, Ning et al. 2020 ).",

As the size of the particles decreases, their deposition rate also decreases, and then, their spread is increased. This J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f supports the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that is high in temperate zones. Based on this evidence, it concluded that the concentration of PM (< 20 mg/m 3 ), latitude, temperature (<13 \u00b0C), particle size (<PM 2.5 ) are suitable environmental conditions for the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 (Chennakesavulu and Reddy 2020).",

The formation of small droplets is essential for the transmission of viral infection, while exhaled respiratory droplets settle very rapidly at high humidity levels. At lower levels of rainfall and daily wind speeds, the spread of the virus may be rapid. Statistical analysis shows that Pearson correlation coefficients between the mean daily PM level were inversely proportional to the average daily wind speed, R 2 = -0.50, and R 2 = -0.32 for PM 10 and PM 2.5 , respectively. Similar to other findings, the time series of climatic variables studied in the study was done by Zoran et al. 2020 showed that a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f sudden drop in outdoor temperature may trigger the COVID-19 epidemic in temperate climates and the RH facilitate aerosol expansion in dry air (Wu, Chen et al. 2020) .",

Subsequently, additional evidence of the other important routes of transmission including airborne pathways were published and became the subject of debate about the effectiveness of airborne pathways in the transmission of COVID-19. According to the WHO (2014), airborne transmission is defined J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f as the spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei (aerosols) that remain infectious when suspended in air over long distances and time. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the association of air particulate matter (PM) pollution in the spreading of COVID-19 prevalence.",

This lifetime suggests J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that it can spread from the source (infected person) through the air. Based on the growing trend of infections and understanding the basic knowledge of the spread of viral infections,Morawska and Cao (2020) proposed that the virus was likely to spread in the air. SARS-CoV-2 virus is ejected along with liquid or solid materials through coughing(Xie et al., 2009; Lindsey et al.,   2012), speaking(Asadi et al., 2019), and sneezing(Bourouiba, 2020). The droplets rapidly evaporate and remain suspended so they can disperse in the air(Santarpia, Rivera et al. 2020;Wang and Du 2020). Various micro-organisms including viruses from the infected persons, both symptomatic and asymptomatic persons, are dissolved in the mucous and become bioaerosols.Initial droplets can range from a few micrometers up to 80 \u00b5m or larger(Xie et al., 2009). Due to the smaller size of the bioaerosols, viruses remain suspended in the air and can spread beyond distance from the origin of emission(Santarpia, Rivera et al. 2020;Wang and Du 2020).According to the results of a research, in COVID-19 patients even without any aerosolgenerating procedure, SARS-CoV-2 can be thrown in the air via particles sized of 1 to 4 \u00b5m, so can be left in the air and transferred(Chia, Coleman et al. 2020).Wang and Du (2020), reported that airborne transmission by aerosols could play a critical role in the transmission of the virus since they diagnosed new cases of the disease in Inner Mongolia and Wuhan city where the patients had no direct contact with any confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, they speculated that the virus may directly spread via aerosol and recommended experimental studies to confirm this hypothesis(Wang and Du 2020). In confirmation of this result,Kumar et al. (2020) reported that during the first quarantine period in India (March 25-April 15), the aerosol concentrations decreased and decreased the spread of the virus in the air",

(2020) reported a positive correlation between PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations with the case mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China providing further evidence for the role of air pollution in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

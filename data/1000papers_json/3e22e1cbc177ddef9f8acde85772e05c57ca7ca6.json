The interferon formed by the infected cell is released and can act on neighbouring or distant cells, protecting them from infection. Freshly formed virus particles from the first infected epithelial cell enter the fluids bathing the epithelial surface and are borne away to initiate fresh foci of infection at more distant sites. Interferons too can reach these sites, and as more and more interferon is formed on the epithelial sheet, more and more cells are protected, so that the infectious process is slowed and finally halted. Other antiviral factors probably play a part, and the adaptive immune response itself comes into action in the final stages. Interferons are produced a few hours after infection of the first epithelial cell at a site where they are needed and without the delay characteristic of the immune response.

This is true for the respiratory infections mentioned above, and also for infections of intestinal epithelium, such as those caused by the human diarrhoea viruses, e.g. rotavirus. The argument does not apply, however, to local infections of the skin. In this case, where the microorganism is not carried across the epithelial surface in a liquid film to establish fresh foci of infection, the whole process takes a This bacterium commonly infects the stratum corneum and causes erythrasma, a scaly condition of the axilla, groyne and between toes. much longer time. Papilloma (wart) viruses, for instance, cause infection in a discrete focus of epidermal cells; indeed a wart consists of a clone of cells produced by the division of a single initially infected cell. The inevitably slow evolution of single virus-rich lesions should mean that immune responses have the opportunity to respond to and limit the infection. Papillomaviruses, however, escape the attention of the immune system. In the basal layer of the epidermis, adjacent to the antibodies and immune cells that arrive from dermal blood vessels, the virus infection is incomplete; in this layer of the epidermis, only a subset of virus genes are transcribed, no virus structural proteins are produced and no virus DNA replication occurs, therefore no virus particles are produced. Some of the proteins which are produced are involved in driving the cell into proliferation or differentiation, others act to downregulate the IFN system and MHC presentation. The infected basal cell is therefore not recognised and not a target for the immune response. As the cells move further away from these immune forces, approaching the epidermal surface and becoming keratinised, more and more virus is produced for liberation to the exterior. Neither antibodies nor immune cells are present on this dry surface to influence virus multiplication and shedding. The respiratory viruses described above have a hit and run type of infection of epithelial cells, and are very successful parasites. A number of other viruses, including measles and chickenpox, infect inconspicuously via the respiratory tract, then spread systemically through the body and only emerge again to cause widespread respiratory infection and shedding to the exterior after a prolonged incubation period. The limitation of rhinoviruses and human coronaviruses to the surface of the upper respiratory tract is at least partly determined by their optimum growth temperature. Many of them replicate successfully at 33 C, the temperature of nasal epithelium, but not very well at the general body temperature, 37 C. Thus, they do not spread systemically nor to the lung. It is also likely that a lack of expression of the virus receptor involved in entry of the virus to the cell plays a major role in determining spread or lack thereof. Viruses of the influenza and parainfluenza groups can infect the lung as well as the nasal mucosa, but they are generally limited to the epithelial surfaces. The limitation is not absolute. Occasionally in adults and more often in infants, influenza and parainfluenza viruses spread to infect the heart, striated muscle or the central nervous system.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The spread of infection from epithelial surfaces is also controlled by the site of virus maturation from cells. Influenza and parainfluenza viruses are liberated (by budding) only from the free (external) surface of epithelial cells, as is appropriate for infection limited to surface epithelium. A similar restriction in the topography of budding is seen with rabies virus in the infected salivary gland. However, vesicular stomatitis virus is released only from the basal surface of the epithelial cell, from whence it can spread to subepithelial tissues and then through the body; topographical restriction in the site of virus release from epithelial cells reflects the polarisation of function in these cells, which in turn depends on the maintenance of tight junctions between them.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Many bacterial infections are largely confined to epithelial surfaces (Table 3 .1). This is a feature, for instance, in diphtheria and streptococcal infections of the throat, gonococcal infections of the conjunctiva or urethra and most Salmonella infections of the intestine. To a large extent this is because host antibacterial forces, to be described at a later stage, do not permit further invasion of tissues. Under most circumstances, these bacteria are not able to overcome the host defences, but gonococci and streptococci, at least, often spread locally through tissues and occasionally systemically through the body. For example, Group A Streptococcus occasionally causes necrotizing fasciitis or 'flesh-eating disease'. Gonococci cause a patchy infection of the columnar epithelium of the male urethra, reaching subepithelial tissues 3\u00c04 days after infection; the yellow discharge consists of desquamated epithelial cells, inflammatory exudate, leucocytes and gonococci.

Certain Gram-negative bacteria penetrate the intestinal epithelium but get no further, as in Shigella dysentery and salmonellosis.

If an obligate intracellular microbe is to spread systemically from the body surface, it must first enter the blood or lymph. This means gaining access to the lumen of a subepithelial lymphatic or blood vessel, either as a free microorganism, or alternatively after entering a mobile cell (leucocyte) that will carry it to other parts of the body. The microorganism cannot replicate until it reaches a susceptible cell, and the absence or shortage of such cells except at the body surface would prevent or seriously hinder its spread through 1 Fungi causing this condition flourish in a moist environment, and athlete's foot is restricted to those who encase their feet in shoes.

Thus, rotaviruses and rhinoviruses replicate at the epithelial surface but cannot infect leucocytes, and in any case would be unlikely to find susceptible cells elsewhere in the body if they entered blood or lymphatic vessels. Certain viruses (yellow fever, poliovirus) spread through the body to reach susceptible target organs (liver, central nervous system) after free virus particles have entered vessels below the skin or intestinal epithelium. Measles virus and tubercle bacilli infect leucocytes, which carry them through the body to organs such as the liver, spleen, skin and lung. A remarkable example of an intracellular bacterium which can manipulate host cells to assist in dissemination is M. leprae. M. leprae targets Schwann cells which are their primary niche and re-programmes them so that they return to a stem cell-like state. The properties of these cells include plasticity and migration and this facilitates the dissemination of M. leprae within those cells by differentiation and via macrophage release.

Extracellular replication itself, however, conveys a serious disadvantage, because the microorganism is exposed to all the antimicrobial forces that the body can summon up. Indeed, bacteria and other microorganisms that are capable of extracellular replication generally advertise their presence by releasing a variety of products into surrounding fluids, many of which cause inflammation and thus bring antibacterial agents such as immunoglobulins, complement and leucocytes to the site of the infection. Lymphatics are also dilated and carry the infecting organisms to lymph nodes for further exposure to antibacterial and immune forces. Intracellular microorganisms in contrast, although exposed to the infected cell's own defence mechanisms, are directly exposed to the general bodily defences only during transit from one infected cell to another. However, if the infected cell is recognised as such by the immune defences, it can be destroyed (see Chapters 6 and 9). A number of bacteria and protozoa, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Brucella abortus or Leishmania donovani, carry out much of their multiplication in macrophages that have ingested them. Although they are not obligate intracellular parasites, this shifts the host\u00c0microbe battlefield into the cell.

Many microbes have strategies for interfering with these defences. For example, cells infected with a virus can commit suicide before the virus has completed its growth cycle in the cell. This is called apoptosis and occurs after reovirus, HIV, and other infections. The fact that viruses (e.g. adenoviruses) have developed mechanisms for inhibiting apoptosis indicates that it plays an important part in defence. Apoptosis occurs also in bacterial infections.

Indeed, their presence in tissues is inferred from their presence in lymphatics draining these tissues. The cells are nearly all T lymphocytes, which leave blood capillaries by actively passing through endothelial cells. After moving about and performing any necessary tasks in the tissues, the lymphocytes penetrate lymphatic capillaries and thus enter the lymph. The lymph, with its content of proteins and cells, then passes through the local lymph nodes and generally at least one more lymph node before entering the thoracic lymph duct and being discharged into the great veins in the thorax or abdomen. Blood lymphocytes also enter lymph nodes directly and in larger numbers through post-capillary venules. The constant movement of lymphocytes from blood to tissues or lymph nodes, and back via lymphatics to the blood again, is called lymphocyte recirculation. Circulating lymphocytes are mostly T cells, and in the course of their continued entries into tissues and lymph nodes they have regular opportunities to encounter any microbial antigens that may be present.

Circulating leucocytes (especially neutrophils and monocytes) adhere to endothelial cells, and this is followed by active passage (diapedesis) of leucocytes between endothelial cells and out into tissues. The affected part now shows the four cardinal signs of inflammation, being RED and WARM (vasodilation), SWOLLEN (vasodilation, cell and fluid exudate) and often PAINFUL (distension of tissues, presence of pain mediators). Lymphatic capillaries also become dilated, taking up the inflammatory fluids and carrying them to local lymph nodes. There is a greatly increased turnover of plasma components in the inflamed tissue. Initially, the predominant cell is the neutrophil, a reflection of the situation in the blood, but neutrophils only live for a day or two in tissues, and as the acute inflammatory state subsides mononuclear cells become more prominent, especially macrophages, which phagocytose dead neutrophils and tissue debris.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Inflammatory Response"}, {"text": "The initial stages of the inflammatory response tend to be consistent, whatever the nature of the tissue insult, and this is partly because the changes are caused by the same mediators of acute inflammation. These include histamine (released from mast cells lying close to blood vessels), kinins (polypeptides derived from precursors in plasma; see Glossary) and products of complement activation by the alternative pathway (C3a and C5a). Some of the kinins are highly active and kallidin, for instance, a decapeptide formed from kallidinogen (an \u03b1 2 globulin) is about 15 times more active (on a molar basis) than histamine in causing inflammation. Most bacteria form inflammatory materials during their growth in tissues, but these are not very potent compared with the activation of C3 and other molecules by carbohydrates (e.g. polysaccharides) present on bacterial surfaces (see Figure 6 .6). Macrophages, when they are stimulated, release a variety of inflammatory mediators and, in addition, immune-mediated inflammation results from interaction of microbial antigen with antibody (via C3a and C5a) or reaction of antigen with IgE antibody on mast cells. The final mediators include molecules such as TNF (tumour necrosis factor), ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and ELAM-1 (endothelial cell leucocyte adhesion molecule-1). Inflammatory responses, like other powerful tissue responses, must be controlled and terminated, and the mediators of inflammation not only have a variety of inhibitors but are also inactivated locally (e.g. kinins inactivated by kininases).

The bone marrow holds a vast reserve supply with 20 times as many neutrophils as are present in the blood. If the tissue demand continues, the rate of production in the bone marrow is increased, and circulating neutrophils may remain elevated in persistent bacterial infections such as subacute bacterial endocarditis. Neutrophil production in the bone marrow is regulated by certain colonystimulating factors, and it is a serious matter if something goes wrong and the marrow supplies are exhausted. A fall in circulating neutrophils (neutropenia) during a bacterial infection is of ominous significance. 2 The terminology becomes complicated.

Neutrophils show random movement in tissues and also a directional movement (chemotaxis) in response to chemical gradients produced by chemotactic substances. Monocytes show little or no random movement, but they too respond to similar chemotactic substances. Chemotactic substances such as leukotrienes, C3a and C5a are formed during the inflammatory response itself. Also, many bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus or S. typhi, form chemotactic substances, and thus automatically betray their presence and attract phagocytic cells. It would obviously be an advantage to an infectious agent if no inflammatory or chemotactic products were formed, but for most large microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, protozoa) these products seem an almost inevitable result of microbial growth and metabolism. However, some pathogens have evolved ways of interfering with the chemotactic process by producing substances that block chemotactic receptors. The early stages of the inflammatory response in particular are known to have an important protective effect against microorganisms. In experimental staphylococcal skin infections, for instance, if the early inflammatory response is inhibited by adrenalin, and the early delivery of plasma factors and leucocytes to the site of infection thus reduced, bacteria multiply more rapidly and produce a more severe lesion. Perhaps it is not surprising that many bacterial pathogens can suppress the early inflammatory response.

Two examples illustrate this point. Iron is essential for bacterial growth but most iron is sequestered in the host and the concentration of free iron in body fluids is too low (ca. 10 218 M in serum) to support growth. In the host, iron is bound by both intracellular (ferritin, haemosiderin and haem) and extracellular (transferrin in serum and milk, and lactoferrin in milk), Fe-binding proteins with high association constants for iron. In order to overcome this problem, bacteria have evolved numerous ways of acquiring iron from the host in concentrations high enough for growth. For example, Listeria monocytogenes produces a soluble reductant which removes iron from transferrin. A common strategy by many bacterial pathogens is the synthesis of low molecular weight compounds called siderophores, which have an extraordinary affinity for iron. At the same time the bacteria express outer membrane proteins that act as receptors for the Fe-siderophore complexes so that Fe is taken up into the cell. E. coli has been extensively studied, and three classes of siderophore have been recognised; ferrichrome, the hydroxymates and aerobactin. Salmonella and Shigella spp. and P. aeruginosa produce more than one siderophore. Salmonella is also known to synthesise receptors for siderophores other than its own, which could be advantageous when present with other organisms, particularly in the competitive environment of the gut.

Yersinia pestis is the agent of bubonic plague and has been responsible for devastating epidemics throughout human history. This pathogen persists in wild rodent populations in many parts of the world except Australia, and is transmitted to humans by the bites of fleas. The blockage of the proventriculae of fleas by Y. pestis forces infected fleas to bite and subsequently regurgitate the infected blood meal into the bite wound of a new host. The ensuing bacteraemia in rodents completes the rodent\u00c0flea\u00c0rodent cycle essential for Y. pestis spread. However the ecology, pathogenicity and host range of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (the predicted ancestor of Y. pestis) and Yersinia enterocolitica are quite different from Y. pestis. These are orally transmitted from contaminated food or water. As described in Chapter 2, they invade Peyer's patches and disseminate to mesenteric lymph nodes (where they multiply extracellularly) and occasionally beyond causing septicemic plaguelike infections; normally these infections are self-limiting. Despite their disease-causing differences, the three Yersinia species do have some common pathogenic strategies, in particular the mechanism(s) for acquiring iron. Yersinia have two important sets of pathogenicity genes: the 70 kb virulence plasmid which has genes encoding proteins involved in inhibition of phagocytosis to which we will return in Chapter 4, and chromosomal genes encoding virulence factors including an 'invasin' (involved in interaction with Peyer's patches) and the pgm (pigmentation) locus. Virulent Y. pestis strains accumulate huge quantities of exogenous haemin to form pigmented colonies on haemin agar (hence the alternative acronym for the locus, hms). Contiguous with the hms is the ybt gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of the siderophore yersiniabactin. In Y. pseudotuberculosis, hms and ybt are not contiguous, and in Y. enterocolitica, hms is absent. Inactivation of hms renders Y. pestis avirulent and unable to develop blockages in fleas, whereas inactivation of ybt in Y. enterocolitica hugely reduces virulence for laboratory animals. In fact, the ybt gene cluster has been designated the 'high pathogenicity island' (HPI) because biotype IB strains of Y. pestis, Y. tuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica (New World strains) all possess ybt biosynthetic genes and kill mice with very low infectious doses. In contrast, biotypes 2\u00c05 (Old World strains) are much less virulent for mice and do not possess ybt genes. Accordingly, the capacity to acquire high concentrations of iron for metabolism is associated with a high virulence phenotype.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF INVADING MICROBES"}, {"text": "Other nutrients in short supply in the mammalian host are aromatic amino acids like tryptophan. Interestingly, the expression of the trp operon (which comprises the genes responsible for the synthesis of tryptophan) is controlled by Fe as well as by tryptophan levels. A functional aromatic biosynthetic pathway is absolutely vital for growth in vivo since aromatic amino acids are generated via chorismic acid. The latter is a branch point at which the biosynthesis of p-amino benzoic acid (PABA) also begins. PABA is required as a precursor of folic acid; it is as a competitor for PABA that the sulphonamide drugs work. By introducing lesions in one or more genes in this system (aroA and aroD), it has been possible to attenuate strains of pathogenic bacteria such as S. typhimurium, E. coli, and Aeromonas salmonicida, such that their initial invasive properties are unaltered but their ability to grow in vivo is severely restricted. In some cases, such crippled constructs can be used as vaccines to protect against subsequent infection or manipulated to carry genes encoding heterologous antigens which may offer immune protection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF INVADING MICROBES"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Plague in the genomic area", "authors": [{"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Baumannn", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Gaulle", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1994, "venue": "Clin.

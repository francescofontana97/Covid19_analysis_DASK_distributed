One particularly difficult question raised in these recommendations and other published allocation frameworks (5, 6) is the following: \"Is it ever ethical to remove a ventilator from a patient in order to reallocate it to another we believe would derive more benefit from it?\"",

Such reallocation is often justified by the \"equivalence thesis: all things being equal, it is ethically justified to withdraw a life-supporting treatment that could conceivably have been withheld in the first place\" (10) . While relatively uncontroversial when aligned with the patient's wishes (11) , this principle has been tentatively extrapolated to crisis standards of care to mean that it is morally permissible to withdraw lifesupporting measures for reallocation purposes, even against the individual patient's wishes and best interests (12) . Claims of moral equivalence in this new situation need to be justifiable to avoid the charge of moral expediency. We propose the following three points that we believe need further study and clarification, as examples of the need for inquiry into this burgeoning controversial issue.",

There is indeed a broad consensus that, in cases when the patient wishes to forego life-prolonging care or the medical team deems such care inappropriate, withdrawing and withholding this care are morally equivalent. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals and the community consistently seem to view withholding lifesupporting measures as less problematic than withdrawing them (13, 14) . Proponents of the equivalence thesis suggest that the reluctance to withdraw life support is due to flawed moral reasoning, psychological bias, and social conventions. Our moral intuitions may be misguided and subject to the 'omission bias', that is, the tendency to consider the consequences of omissions as morally less serious than that when due to direct actions (15) . On that view, not initiating life-supporting measures resulting in patient death would be mistakenly construed as more acceptable than causing a patient death by withdrawing life support. An extensive ethical and legal debate about such moral intuitions led to the consensus that honoring a patient's wish to discontinue a life-prolonging therapy has the same moral status as honoring a wish not to initiate it. This new situation of reallocation, possibly against a patient's wish, warrants a new discussion about these moral intuitions.",

This would include not only the intentions of those performing the actions, but also risks and predicted outcomes. However, the application of a reallocation process will necessarily ignore the obvious fact that the predicted outcome of the patient, who in this new situation is still benefiting from life-support measures, is better than before they were initiated, that is, all things are not equal. Withdrawal of a ventilator to reallocate it to another person may very well be justified in some situations, but the equivalence thesis will not be enough, and appeal to other ethical principles, such as fairness and distributive justice, will need to be convincingly argued.",

What is the relative moral (and legal) blameworthiness of not saving a person's life that could be saved versus physically stopping something that is keeping someone alive if the wish of the patient is to stay alive? 4.

We agree that allocation frameworks should generally satisfy both utilitarian and rule-based models but worry that the particular scenario of \"withdrawing to reallocate\" has been primarily justified on utilitarian grounds. Thus, we suggest a cautious approach to withdrawing life support, one that is individualized rather than protocol driven and includes all key stakeholders (triage team, care team, patients, and their loved ones). Until a consensus emerges, the principle of caution should apply in case of disagreements. This approach is consistent with that proposed by Sprung and colleagues, which we believe balances uncertainty with flexibility (4).",

            "text": "Adults suffer on average from one to six episodes of an acute infection per year. The epidemiology of acute illness in elite level athletes has been studied in a variety of settings, mainly during major tournaments and in different sports including swimming, rugby and football [6] . Six to seventeen percent of registered athletes participating in major international games and tournaments of shorter duration (<4 weeks) are likely to suffer an acute illness episode. There are some data indicating that higher-risk subgroups are (1) female athletes, (2) athletes participating in winter sports (e.g. Olympic and Paralympic Games), (3) athletes with disability [7] [8] [9] and (4) athletes participating in more prolonged tournaments or competition [10] . Data from these studies consistently show that the most common system affected by acute illness is the respiratory tract, followed by the gastrointestinal system and the dermatological system [11, 12] . Scarce data exists on the incidence and aetiology of acute illness of athletes outside the major tournaments and competitions, i.e. in their home setting. Studies exclusively in football players show that the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are the most common systems affected by illness, during the studied tournaments. During the 2009 Confederations Cup, the incidence of illness was 16.9 per 1000 player days, with the respiratory tract (RT) accounting for over 50% of all illness (the ear, nose and throat = 37%; other respiratory tract = 20%) [12] . Similarly, during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, respiratory illness was the most common medical condition affecting football players (40% of all illness) [11] .",

The main theory is that a transient or more prolonged immune depression postexercise may contribute to the pathophysiology and risk of acute illness [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Indeed, changes in a variety of immune system components following a single intensive exercise session have been observed. Postexercise immune changes may be most pronounced when the exercise session is >90-min long and the intensity is 55-75% of maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 Max) [13] , while other data indicate that a session longer than 60 min at an intensity >80% of maximum ability causes a depression in the immune system [19] .",

            "text": "Observed changes include an increase in circulating neutrophils [3, 15, 20] , a decrease in the lymphocytes [3, 15] , a decrease in neutrophil function (oxidative activity and phagocytic capacity) for 1-3 days after the exercise session [3, 15, 17] , a reduction in natural killer (NK) cell numbers and cytotoxic activity [3, 13] as well as a decrease in the salivary IgA concentrations [3, 17, 21] . Furthermore, there is an increase in the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (used as a predictor of stress to the immune system) for most of the following days after a heavy exercise session [22] . A 20% reduction in plasma glutamine concentration may occur, while there is conflicting evidence regarding T-cell function [3, 23] . The existing studies are typically in endurance type of sports, while strength sports have been less studied, in this regard. A single bout of exercise thus results in changes in various immune parameters, typically lasting for 3-72 h. This period is known as the \"open window\" and has been widely proposed to reflect a time of \"dysfunction\" of the immune system, during which the athlete may be predisposed to viral and bacterial infections [1, 3, 21, 23] . However, the clinical relevance of the observed changes is still debated. Despite evidence that certain immunologic parameters change after strenuous exercise sessions, there is a lack of evidence of a direct link between the altered immune parameters and an increased incidence for URT illness, postexercise [3, 13, 24, 25] . The reason for this lack of evidence may be that some of the observed changes are physiological, as part of the acute-phase (inflammatory) response to training [26] . In addition, it has also been shown that overtraining leads to immune suppression, which may render the athlete susceptible to an acute URT illness [19, 27] . Clinically, reports of elite athletes experiencing repeated colds could also be due to the fact that an elite athlete will be relatively more affected by an ordinary cold than the average person who has less demand on maximal performance in everyday life.",

            "text": "Fever is the symptom best known to any athlete or team physician, to make them aware of a possible ongoing infection. An infection will result in different degrees of response from the immune system. The hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre integrates afferent information from the periphery to regulate body temperature [43] . The core body temperature is normally kept within a range of 1-36.5-37.5 \u00b0C. Clinically, it is important to note that rectal temperatures are slightly higher than oral temperatures, with the difference being about 0.5\u00b0C. Women may have cyclic variations in their body temperature, in association with the menstrual phases. Fever is defined as a temperature that exceeds the normal and is accompanied by a shift in the thermoregulatory control. Exogenous pyrogens, such as microbial toxins or viruses, bind to macrophages and trigger the release of endogenous pyrogens (pyrogenic cytokines such as interleukins, TNF, IFN-\u03b1) [44] . Both types of pyrogens increase the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which acts on the hypothalamus, via cyclic AMP, to adjust the thermoregulation upwards. Although fever is a physiologic response to an infection, it could also be the result of other immune stimuli, such as inflammation, malignancy or haemorrhagic stroke. The potential complications during exercise due to fever are multiple. For several reasons, it may also be beneficial to treat the fever itself and not only the underlying cause. Especially, when the temperature is extremely high, approaching hyperpyrexia (>41.5\u00b0C), it is necessary to decrease the temperature by antipyretics, as the risk of complications is increased",

Heat stroke is defined as an increased body temperature, not caused by exogenous or endogenous pyrogens. The mechanism is an uncontrolled increase in body temperature due to excessive heat production (i.e. playing in a hot environment, without proper cooling). In this case, heat production may be faster than the combined peripheral loss of heat by sweating and respiration. This condition may be fatal, in extreme cases (>41-43\u00b0C) causing multi-organ dysfunction, including rapid liver and kidney failure (due to muscle necrosis) [46, 47] , and is therefore important to distinguish from fever/ hyperpyrexia. Heat stroke is the most extreme form of heat-related illnesses, which also include heat exhaustion and muscle cramps.

Depending on the type of infection and the causative agent, different precautions have to be undertaken [43] . See below, for diarrheal disease and dermatological infections. \u2022 Neurologically, the coordination has been shown to decrease during infection/fever. In 1 study, 14 participants with influenza or echovirus infection, all suffering from myalgia, and 9 participants with mumps, in whom this symptom was lacking, were investigated with single-fibre electromyography (EMG) in the acute phase and during convalescence. A possible disturbance in neuromuscular transmission was revealed [1] . Decreased coordination and balance may be associated with an increased injury risk. \u2022 Muscle strength will be negatively affected during an ongoing infection. There is evidence that infection leads to a decrease in muscle protein content (which correlates to a decline in muscle strength and endurance), a reduction in muscle enzyme activity and mitochondrial abnormalities. It might take up to 2 weeks for the muscle protein to be replenished. This is in addition to fever, which in itself may also cause a decrease in muscle strength (see above). The infection will contribute to the decrease in exercise performance experienced by athletes after an URT infection [50] . This is a reason in itself to refrain from training/playing. Furthermore, the decrease in exercise performance after full clinical recovery from an URT illness can last for 2-4 days [3] and in more severe infections (influenza) may be present for several weeks after the infection has subsided, even after the athlete has returned to sport.",

URT is very common and is the reason for a large part of training interruption for an athlete, possibly several times/year [53] . An increase in the frequency of infections is usually seen in athletes during the years they have small children but also during heavy training periods. The clinically common worry of many athletes with frequent URI that they may have some underlying immune deficiency is typically unfounded. However, as the immune function may be decreased secondary to intense, prolonged and/or increased activity, athletes have to be gradually accustomed to the higher intensity of play/ training. This is specifically applicable to new players coming from junior and/or lower football leagues. Repeated infections should therefore be taken as a possible warning sign of overloading (see below). The return to play after a common cold follows the general recommendations as outlined above, that the athlete should return only after full recovery and gradually resume training. If the URI is caused by bacteria (differential diagnosis), this could both be a primary infection and secondary to a viral infection. Most commonly these infections are caused by the betastreptococci, causing tonsillitis, impetigo, medial otitis and/or acute bronchitis. Oral antibiotic treatment should be started, and the athlete may return to sport when the infection has subsided and after finishing the antibiotic treatment.",

            "text": "As different infections have different propensity for cardiac and other complications, because they are caused by different microbes, the differential diagnosis is important. Simple tests (such as for beta-streptococci in the throat) may be used to differentiate between a viral and bacterial infection. However, other tests, such as C-reactive pro-tein (CRP), leucocyte count and liver enzymes, may also be used to establish the degree of severity of any given infection. Indeed, the most common clinical decision regarding URI is if the infection is viral or bacterial and thus treatable by antibiotics. A sign often used in clinical practice, with little scientific evidence, to determine the athletes' availability for training/playing, is the \"neck check\". The underlying theory is that infections causing symptoms below the neck contradict exercise, i.e. joint pain, widespread muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms and productive cough, while infections causing only symptoms above the neck, such as runny nose in an otherwise unaffected athlete, may be more compatible with exercise (slight cold or allergies). The grey zone will be the athlete presenting solely with a \"sore throat\". In our clinical experience, such an athlete should be advised to refrain from training/playing during the day in question. On the following day, the infection has become evident or the athlete will possibly have recovered fully to resume training.",

            "text": "Mononucleosis is a special case of URIs that is very common in young individuals (i.e. \"kissing disease\"). The disease is clinically important in sports medicine, because of the possible long layoff from sports and because of potential serious complications from sporting activity during the infection. IM is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus and typically presents as a URI, with dominating throat pain, fever, headache and malaise. Importantly, a majority of individuals affected by mononucleosis may be asymptomatic (subclinical infection). IM may mimic tonsillitis with swollen cervical lymph nodes and yellow detritus at the tonsils [55] . Treatment with antibiotics is typically not associated with improvement of the clinical picture. \"Tonsillitis\", not responding to antibiotics in a young individual, should thus raise the suspicion of IM. To confirm the diagnosis, the physician may use a fast-track antibody test (monospot) or serology. Often the liver may be affected (as shown by increased liver enzymes) and T lymphocytes are increased. The most important complication may be enlargement of the spleen and loss of its architectural stability, increasing the risk of splenic rupture secondary to abdominal trauma [2] or increased intra-abdominal pressure [1, 56] . Data indicate that 50% of splenic ruptures occur without a direct blow to the spleen and the risk of rupture is 0.1-0.5% [3] . The risk for rupture is highest in the first 3 weeks but is very rare after 28 days [2] .",

Particularly after intensive training periods, athletes should have a detailed individualised training and competition planning, including post-event recovery measures (encompassing nutrition and hydration, sleep and psychological recovery) [6] . Sleep disruption has also been linked to immune depression [34] , and efforts should thus be made to get adequate sleep [2, 3, 5] . Sports governing bodies have the responsibility to consider the competition load and hence the health of the athletes when planning their event calendars. This requires increased coordination between single-and multisport event organisers and the development of a comprehensive calendar of all international sports events. Psychological load (stressors) such as negative life event stress and daily hassles can significantly increase the risk of illness in athletes. Practical recommendations should be centred on educating athletes, coaches and support staff in proactive stress management [61] .",

            "text": "Money can be understood from an individual perspective as an abstract form of wealth. From a communal perspective, however, money is better regarded as a debt, a biophysical liability, a lien on future real income of the community. Proper recognition of this dual nature raises concerns over modern, aggressive practices of money creation. It provokes a general reassessment of current institutional agreements surrounding money. In this contribution, said agreements are shown to endow money with an unnatural power to preserve its function despite structural decay. The origin of money interest derives from such institutionally given, unnatural power, where it should be noted that interest itself leads to a strong temptation among entities with money issuance rights to issue more and more. Ultimately, considered together, the dual nature of money and the biophysical origin of money interest provoke the need for a societal reappraisal of which entities should properly be given the right to create money, and which are functioning as \"legal counterfeiters\". If a transition towards a more sustainable, more equitable bioeconomy is to be realized one day, discussion over who those entities are and what their rightful role is must be reopened.",

            "text": "We face here a curious dual nature of money, one that generalizes for all forms of money and money substitute (\"general liquidity\"). Proper attention is due to that duality in discussions of sustainability. To shed light on it, this contribution revisits the widely unappreciated biophysical foundation of general liquidity. One of the present authors previously investigated F. Soddy's important contributions to the theory of money, contributions which had been paid little attention in the decades preceding (Daly 1980) . This contribution offers a fresh revisiting of Soddy through its discussion of the dual nature of money. It offers a new perspective on money theory, relevant for discussions of sustainable and responsible development paradigm within communities concerned with the nature of finance in an equitable bioeconomy. It must be emphasized that for Soddy, wealth is a physical flow of goods and services contributing to a decent life, following the idea of J. Ruskin. Soddy (1933a) described the part of money aggregate that is to be exchanged for goods and services as \"virtual wealth\" and asserted that other forms of money should be minimized. He stressed that a subtle balance between physical wealth and virtual wealth should be maintained (Soddy 1934) . Those ideas, ultimately prompting his proposal to prevent demand deposits from becoming a source of bank loans, deeply influenced the Chicago Plan and Fisher's (1936) 100% Money.",

            "text": "The manuscript is organized as follows. The section \"The dual nature of money and its implications for sustainability\" introduces the core rationale. Namely, it presents the dual nature of money. Though money is regarded as a form of wealth for individuals, money is a source of biophysical debt for the community to which those individuals belong. The section \"Money creation and the origin of money interest: two potential causes of rapidly increasing biophysical debt\" discusses two potential causes of increasing biophysical debt: (1) the desire of all economic entities with the right to issue money to take advantage of said right, and (2) the privilege, given to money owners, to be able to expect positive interest on their money stock. If we properly recognize the dangers of a disequilibrating increase in money stock insofar as such a thing threatens to disrupt the biophysical base of economic activities, two crucial decisions must then be made: (1) the decision over who should be entitled to issue legal tender and thereby receive the benefit of seigniorage, and (2) the decision over how to mitigate distributional inequalities, if and when money issuers create them. The section \"Who should be responsible for the issuance of money\" addresses those two points, which are closely related to the discussion of who owns newly created money as an asset and who owns it as a debt as well as the discussion of how and when debt is to be repaid at what rate of interest. Finally, the conclusion section comments on the dual nature of money's characteristic to inform the contemporary discourse on processes of rapid financial globalization.",

This amount constitutes a debt (Graeber 2011). The existence of money as a universally exchangeable token is the result of such unequal exchange. A bearer of money is typically understood to have provided wealth to a community but not yet received equivalent wealth in return (Macleod 1894) .",

On the other hand, the existence of money implies a community capable of providing goods and services in exchange for money and a corresponding process of economic production, consumption, and disposal running in biophysical deficit. That process is entropic, since useful energy and materials are consumed irrevocably in its course with fewer exhaustible resources remaining after (Georgescu-Roegen 1971) . Real capital produced by economic processes, such as basic infrastructure, also unavoidably decays over time at a rate in tune with its size. This decay induces further irrevocable biophysical debt through its implication of the need for maintenance and renewal processes. For all these reasons, an increase in money can be regarded from a communal perspective as an increase in future biophysical liability.",

Money can be understood both as a form of wealth from an individual perspective and as a driving force of biophysical debt from a communal perspective. It's worth stressing that \"individual\" and \"communal\" are contextual terms that can only be properly defined in relation to each other.

            "text": "Soddy was perhaps the earliest scholar to properly and clearly grasp the dual nature of money. To wit, Soddy (1933a, p. 222) writes: \"National securities and money are both wealth from the standpoint of the individual owner and [\u2026] debt from the standpoint of the community.\" Consider a basic, illustrative example of the dual nature, provided through observation of the Bank of Japan's balance sheet. Although the vast majority of Japanese people do not realize it, the Bank of Japan is a sort of private company with stocks traded on the JASDAQ in Tokyo. The Bank of Japan's accounts, which include government securities such as Japanese national bonds, are therefore counted by the Bank as assets, not liabilities-national bonds are a form of wealth for the Bank of Japan as an individual agent. On the other hand, as of 30 September 2020, Japanese government securities held by the Bank of Japan amounted to more than \u00a5530 trillion, equivalent to 57% of outstanding Japanese national bonds-national bonds are a form of debt to Japan as a community. More importantly for general issues of sustainability, Japanese national bonds are a potential biophysical debt, as they drive entropic processes that themselves accelerate natural resource exploitation and so forth. The dual nature of money is not a particularly complicated aspect of money to grasp when explained properly. Still, evidentially, it seems not to be duly recognized either by the general public or by economists.",

That civilization, coal-based, was typified by financial fraud (Robb 2002) . Some decades after Macleod, financial actions linked to the Great Depression once again occasioned concern over the possibility of catastrophe brought on by excessive commercial bank credit creation. Mark (1934) and Wilson (1934) were two representatives of that concern, both of whom Soddy greatly admired. Still more recently, in modern times, nearly a century later, similar concerns are once again mounting. As noted in the previous section, an increase in money is an increase in future biophysical liability-there is merit to the modern concerns.",

Clausius (1867) proposed to measure the degree of dispersion of matter in terms of a then-new variable: disgregation. Entropy is the sum of disgregation and heat dispersion, the latter being the aspect of entropy that has received the lion's share of attention in the modern thermodynamics discourse. Taken independently, neither component of entropy is a total differential. In other words, taken in isolation, the integral of either disgregation or heat dispersion cannot be transformed into a thermodynamic state function. This is a critical insight that, in and of itself, explains why Georgescu-Rogen's (1977) \"fourth law\" cannot be established as a physical law. The \"fourth law\" refers only to the disgregation component of entropy.",

Soddy's findings, being a basis of the \"Macleod-Soddy-Allais\" (MSA) relation, show that the present value of all interest payments between any finite point of time and the infinite point of time for a principal of A is equal to A. Money owners are thereby enabled to obtain an additional A units of interest payment over the course of redemption of the principal A. The MSA relation can be regarded as a fundamental factor of instability in modern financial markets, a factor that ultimately pushes the financial market in the direction of asset bubbles-related to the extensive creation of fictitious assets, running insolvencya condition much more severe than running solvency, and general unsustainability. Naturally, entities entitled to issue money and money substitutes (\"general liquidity\") cannot resist the temptation to issue ever more, circumstances allowing. As Soddy (1931, p. 25 ) put it, paraphrased by one of the present authors (Daly 1980, p. 474) , \"The ruling passion of the age is to convert wealth into debt in order to derive a permanent future income from it-to convert wealth that perishes into debt that endures, debt that does not rot, costs nothing to maintain, and brings in perennial interest.\" Soddy's point was that such a conversion is an illusion resulting from the dual nature of money and the fallacy of composition. While an individual can live off the interest on the debt that the individual owns, a community as a unitary whole cannot live off the interest on its members' mutual indebtedness.",

Consider how, whenever a niche for expansion of bureaucratic power emerges within a political institution, that niche tends towards a rapid occupation by newly created bureaucratic activities. Hayek (1990) , one of the most trenchant supporters of free banking policy, heavily criticized the unnecessary expansion of public expenditure through government money creation. He identified government monopoly as the source of unnecessary inflation. The experience of reconstruction following the Great Tohoku-Kanto Earthquake in Japan illustrates some of the difficulties involved. Among reconstruction efforts, in total, the Board of Audit of Japan identified as inappropriate 326 out of 1401 \"reconstruction projects\", totaling \u00a51.3 trillion. More than 12% of the reconstruction fund was ultimately spent on projects having nothing to do with great earthquake damages (Mayumi 2020) . Such a situation is common following the injection of a large quantity of general liquidity and, in this way, discussion on the distribution of newly created sovereign money can be understood as crucial. How to achieve a subtle balance between the production of goods and services on the one hand and virtual wealth, in Soddy's sense, on the other, without disrupting the general price, is a moot point. This holds not only for those goods and services that constitute gross domestic product accounts, normally considered by economists such as Hayek, but also for other items such as land-related assets and financial assets.",

For the sake of simplicity, assume that there are price level indices for: goods and services, land-related assets, and financial assets. Any form of increase in money and money substitutes ultimately results in a relative increase in each of these three price indices-specific, respective increases depending on what percent of the increase in general liquidity is spent on each of the three categories. Concerning the general price issue, what has been happening in economically advanced nations since the 1980s, mainly due to banking deregulation at a global scale, can be understood in the following manner: (1) on the demand side of the three categories and relative to supply, a disproportionate demand increase in financial assets, occasionally followed by additional demand increase in land-related assets and compared with a relatively stagnating demand increase in goods and services-reflecting a situation where consumption of the basic items required for a decent life is saturated, and (2) on the supply side of the general liquidity driving demand, a disproportionate increase in the supply of financial assets, associated with money creation by traditional banks as well as derivative and other financial instrument creation by shadow banks. Therefore, the influence of an increase in general liquidity has led to conspicuous financial asset price increases, often together with housing market price increases, as observed in the early 2000s. In this way, economically advanced nations now engaging in quantitative easing policy aiming at \"price stability\" seem to overlook financial inflation, currently occurring in global stock markets, and the consequent increase of income inequality and wealth distribution. The scope of \"price index in economics\" is too narrow. There is an urgent need for us to create a new three-index framework grounded in a paradigm of sustainability and equity (Mayumi 2020) .",

Our consideration does not address possible international arrangements, which could work to prevent an excessive expansion of the global money supply. Under the present flexible exchange regime, any change in prime interest rate adopted by any major currency induces far-reaching repercussions in the exchange rates of all other major currencies, as well as changes in investment decisions by companies and private financial agents. Furthermore, adjustments in exchange rates inevitably create capital transfers among those looking for global financial investment opportunities. Though nobody realistically knows how to deal with such circumstances, we do at least know that without international cooperation, any national-level decision on a new form of money supply system will quickly meet with ruin. The collapse of the Bretton Woods regime in 1971 is one exemplar. We seem to intuitively understand that too much expansion of general liquidity, translating to excessive levels of debt from the communal perspective, threatens potentially devastating economic consequences. However, these are extremely complicated issues to address. The Jubilee, for example, which in Judeo-Christian tradition was a point in time where all debts were to be automatically canceled, occurring in the \"Sabbath of Sabbath years\" or in other words after the passing of seven cycles of seven years, stands testament to the fact that excessive debt expansion is something that has troubled humankind for millennia.",

On that note, in closing and looking towards future discussions, it is worth recalling that Keynes himself ultimately aborted his optimistic monetary reform scheme, discussed in his A Tract on Monetary Reform [Keynes (1923 [Keynes ( ) 2013 . To wit, later in his career, Keynes (1933, p. 758 ) sympathized with the minimization of \"economic entanglement among nations\" and advocated to \"let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and, above all, to let finance be primarily national.\"",

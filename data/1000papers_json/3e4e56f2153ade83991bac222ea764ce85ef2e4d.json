            "text": "The amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere is increasing continuously in the industrial era, 11 posing a threat to the ecological balance on Earth. There are two ways to reduce elevated CO 2 12 concentrations ([CO 2 ] high ): reducing human emissions or increasing their absorption by oceans 13 and plants. However, in response to [CO 2 ] high , plants diminish gas exchange and CO 2 uptake 14 by closing stomata. Surprisingly, we do not know how plants sense CO 2 in their environment, 15 and the basic mechanisms of the plant response to [CO 2 ] high are very poorly understood. Here, 16 we show that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are plant CO 2 receptors. We 17 demonstrate that MPK4, a prominent MAPK that is known to be involved in the stomatal 18 response to [CO 2 ] high 1-3 , is capable of binding CO 2 and is directly activated by a very low 19 increase in [CO 2 ] in vivo and in vitro. Unlike MPK4 activation by infections 4 , stress and 20 hormones within known MAPK signalling cascades, [CO 2 ] high -induced MPK4 activation is 21 independent of the upstream regulators MKK1 and MKK2. Moreover, once activated, MPK4 22 is prone to inactivation by bicarbonate. The identification of stress-responsive MPK4 as a 23 CO 2 receptor sheds new light on the integration of various environmental signals in guard 24 cells, setting up MPK4 as the main hub regulating CO 2 availability for photosynthesis. This 25 result could help to find new ways to increase CO 2 uptake by plants. 26 27 28 work together and that ABA enhances the response to [CO 2 ] high ; however, [CO 2 ] high signalling 33 is still active in the absence of ABA and key elements of ABA signalling 5 . Only the 34 downstream effectors, S-type anion channels, i.e., SLAC1, and some of their regulators are 35 shared by the ABA and CO 2 pathways. Thus, except BIG 6 and RHC1 7 , the connections of 36 which with core pathways remain unclear, known specific regulators of CO 2 signalling in 37 guard cells belong to the MAPK superfamily. Among these proteins, CBC1/2 8 and HT1 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MKKKs) are involved in pathways leading 39 to low [CO 2 ]-induced stomatal opening or inhibition of stomatal closure rather than [CO 2 ] high -40 induced stomatal closure. In contrast, MPK12 and MPK4 are essential upstream mediators of 41 the [CO 2 ] high 1,2 pathway promoting SLAC1-mediated stomatal closure via HT1 3 inactivation. 42 Because MPK12 orthologues are guard cell-specific kinases found only in 43 Brassicaceae 9 , we focused on MPK4 to reveal the general mechanisms of [CO 2 ] high sensing in 44 all plants, as silencing of NtMPK4 impaired [CO 2 ] high -and dark-induced stomatal closure by 45 disrupting the activation of slow-type anion channels in Nicotiana tabacum 1 . 46 47 Results 131 132 133 134 activity was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MBP.

Recent studies, however, have proposed otherwise, suggesting that both pathways 32 48 MPK4 is activated by CO 2 in vivo 49 No kinase involved in plant CO 2 signalling has been shown to be activated by 50 [CO 2 ] high in vivo to date; therefore, we decided to study MPK4 activation in response to 51 [CO 2 ] high in epidermal peels. In line with the reported high activity of the MPK4 promoter in 52 guard cells 4 , we detected very high MPK4 expression in Arabidopsis epidermal peels using 53 immunoblotting (Fig. 1a) . 54 The activity of MPK4 was extremely low compared to that of the highly active MPK3 55 and MPK6. The lack of MPK4 activation in the control samples indicates the maintenance of 56 stress-free conditions in the experimental system used. We assumed that the method used to 57 study [CO 2 ] high -induced MPK activation should utilize direct analysis of the protein extract 58 without lengthy sample preparation steps at indoor [CO 2 ] under native conditions. Therefore, 59 we rejected the classic in-gel kinase assay following kinase immunoprecipitation. ",

            "text": "The MPK4 T201A/Y203F supports the importance of TEY for CO 2 recognition. The lack of CO 2 binding under high ATP availability may underlie the mechanism for 195 elimination of fluctuations in endogenous [CO 2 ], because when ATP availability increases, 196 [CO 2 ] increases locally due to the proximity of mitochondria. Interestingly, MPK4inactivation is strongest at concentrations of dissolved atmospheric CO 2 and at very high seems to be a very effective autoregulatory mechanism, in which the CO 2 sensor is inactivated during a long-term increase in [CO 2 ] (mainly HCO 3 at the pH of the cytoplasm). This may also be an important mechanism of cross-talk between CO 2 and stress signalling, as different adverse conditions activate MPK4, leading to modification of the plant response to CO 2 during stress (Supplementary Fig. 7).In general, our findings are important for the regulation of plant growth and development by CO 2, as MPK4 regulates cytokinesis 15 and photosynthesis 16 . The best summary of this is a picture of the highly enlarged stomata(Supplementary Fig. 8) of extremely dwarfed mpk4 plants 4,16 , supporting previous results from tobacco plants with silenced NtMPK4 1 . The broad importance of the presented results could be considered because MAPKs are conserved enzymes in all eukaryotes. In human lungs, MAPKs are activated by SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 17,18 and other causative agents of pneumonia 19-23 to trigger the production signalling 19 and thus protects against severe lung diseases caused by lipopolysaccharide 20,21 , bleomycin 19 , and cigarette smoke 22 and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) exposure 23 . However, ACE2 is bound by SARS-CoV-2 24,25 , leading to cytokine storms and a severe course of pneumonia and resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, the inhibition of active MAPKs could be a strategy to prevent the acute course of COVID-19. Based on the inactivation of active plant MPKs by CO 2 described herein, we encourage researchers to study the inhibitory effect of CO 2 on human MAPKs against lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury in mice. In addition, tobacco smoke has been",

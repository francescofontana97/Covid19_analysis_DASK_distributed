The recent report published by Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention of 72,314 cases of COVID-19 shown that, the mortality rate is on the higher side if the virus infected patient is suffering from diabetes. (7.3% in patients with diabetes while only 2.3% in other patients) [4, 5] . Similarly, those suffering from advanced chronic liver diseases are also at greatest risk of infection owing to autoimmune liver diseases and cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction [6] . It has been confirmed that, the liver cells get infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection as the receptor of the virus is ACE2, which has been revealed to be expressed on cholangiocytes [7, 8] . The study confirmed that, 43 out of 99 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had some sort of liver function abnormality.",

The DCGI has given a protocol for carrying out a phase II, open label, randomized controlled trials for assessing the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma [30]. The given document highlights the policies to be pursued while adopting CP therapy in India. The Delhi, Kerala and the Maharashtra were states of India where the trials were initiated to combat devastating COVID-19 infection in a large number of patients. The first patient in India (aged 49) who was treated with convalescent plasma therapy in Delhi has now recovered from COVID-19 and was discharged from hospital on April 24, 2020 [31]. This patient was admitted in hospital with history of respiratory diseases and moderate symptoms. In the next few days his condition worsened and he developed pneumonia with Type I respiratory failure. He did not respond to the available therapy, later given ventilator support, but the condition deteriorated with time, therefore the CP administration started as per the established protocol from day 10 of infection. The progressive improvement was observed in the patient from day two and on the fourth day of transfusion of CP the ventilator support was weaned off. The patient was successfully recovered from infection within 10 days of transfusion of convalescent plasma.",

Pre-donation screening should be carried out. The donor should be free from any signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection and two negative results should be obtained for SARS-CoV-2 by molecular testing of blood or nasopharyngeal swab testing.3. The informed consent of the donors should be collected.4. The donor's blood grouping and screening for transfusion transmissible infectionsshould be carried out.5. The blood is to be withdrawn from the recovered person of COVID-19 infection, as per the standard parameters/ established protocol.6. The plasma has to be separated from whole blood and investigated for presence of virus-neutralising antibodies by the experts.7. The storage and transportation of CP to the respective hospitals for the transfusions.8. Compatibility testing of critically ill and aged patients of COVID-19 should be carried out.9. The informed consent from a patient or his legal heirs (if unconscious) should be taken.10. The respiratory rate of the patient should be > 24/min and SaO2 < 93% on room air or PaO2/ FiO2 <300.11. The clinical transfusion process should be carried out as per the existing protocol.12. The continuous assessment of the success of this empirical therapy should be carried out for 7 to 10 days. The viral load, antibody levels and other clinical tests should be monitored.",

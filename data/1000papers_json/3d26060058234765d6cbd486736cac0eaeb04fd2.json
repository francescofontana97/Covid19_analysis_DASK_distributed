The formulation was manufactured in the following processes. Briefly, appropriate 135 amounts of lipid mixture were dissolved in ethanol (J. T. Baker, USA) and injected to a 136 hydroxychloroquine sulfate (SCI Pharmtech, Inc., Taiwan) solution at 50\u00b0C. The size of the 137 liposomes was adjusted to 200 nm by an extruder with 0.2 \u00b5m polycarbonate membrane to 138 standardize the sizes of the liposomes. A tangential flow filtration (TFF, VIVAFLOW 200, 139 MWCO 100,000 PES, Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Germany) was used to remove 140 non-incorporated HCQ and ethanol to obtain the liposomal HCQ in 0.9% sodium chloride 141 (Merck KGaA, Germany). 142 Study Design. A total of 52 female SD rats (BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd.) were assigned 143 to one of three treatment groups: (1) HCQ-IV: 12 rats received a single dose of 0.590 mg 144 HCQ sulfate per animal via IV injection; (2) HCQ-IT: 20 rats received a single dose of 145 0.590 mg HCQ sulfate per animal via intratracheal (IT) administration; and (3) liposomal hours post-dose and for tissue/organ samples were 0.25, 4, 24 and 72 hours post-dose. In 149 this study, inhalable liposomal HCQ was administered through IT instillation to mimic the 150 intended inhaled administration in a clinical setting.

From the viewpoint of Health and Physical Fitness in North America, the present era was probably initiated by formation of the President's Council on Physical Fitness in the U.S. (1956 CE) and in Canada by a speech that the Duke of Edinburgh made to the Canadian Medical Association (in 1959 CE) . For Canadians, the Duke's speech was quickly followed by passage of the Federal Bill C-131, and formation of the Federal Directorate of Fitness & Amateur Sport in 1961 CE. On the world stage, also, the early 1960s was an important turning point for Exercise Scientists, as the sophisticated apparatus previously available only to a few privileged Medicallystaffed clinical laboratories became available to Kinesiologists and Physical Educators. The Post-Modern Era that we shall discuss in this chapter thus extends from the early 1960s through to the present day.

Finally, the gas composition was determined by a tedious process of chemical analysis, and the volume of gas that had been expired was measured by emptying the Douglas bag through a dry gas meter. Up to 30 min was required in order to complete a single measurement of oxygen consumption, and this greatly limited the number of observations that could be made during any one investigation.

I was intrigued to seek out the \"bottle-neck\" during my first few years in Toronto, and measured maximal values for individual links in the oxygen transport chain during near-maximal effort; the variables examined included the maximal voluntary ventilation (Shephard 1967b) , the oxygen cost of breathing (Shephard 1966b) , the maximal pulmonary diffusing capacity (Anderson and Shephard 1968) , and the maximal cardiac output (Simmons and Shephard 1971) . Both the late John Sutton (Sutton 1992) and Peter Wagner (Wagner 1996) have had a similar idea of looking at oxygen consumption as a closely linked chain reaction. By applying the analogue of an electrical conductance (Shephard 2010a) , and looking at the distribution of gas pressure gradients, I concluded that for oxygen the most important factor limiting oxygen transport in the average healthy individual was blood stream conductance (the product of peak muscle blood flow and the oxygen carrying capacity of unit volume of blood) (Shephard 1969 (Shephard , 1970 . Table 9 .1 Potential factors limiting maximal oxygen transport Ventilatory: Maximal power of respiratory muscles; airway collapse; poor matching of ventilation and perfusion; maximal pulmonary diffusing capacity. Central circulation: Peak stroke volume and heart rate; haemoglobin level and oxygen affinity; tolerance of rising blood pressure. Peripheral circulation: Muscle blood flow and capillary density; tissue diffusing capacity and oxygen extraction. Muscle: Myoglobin and energy reserves, substrate delivery, mitochondrial enzyme activity However, a variety of other factors can limit oxygen transport, both in athletes with a very large maximal oxygen intake, and in individuals with chronic disease (Table 9 .1), If the exercise does not involve most of the major muscles in the body, the local accumulation of lactate and the rise of blood pressure may limit muscular effort before the capacity of the central circulation has been fully taxed (Table 9 .2). Fatigue of the respiratory muscles is a minor factor in most healthy individuals (Macklem 1979) , but in some people, maximal performance may be limited by the sensation of dyspnoea, which depends in part on the strength of the inspiratory muscles (Killian and Campbell 1974) . In athletes who develop very high respiratory flow rates, during maximal exercise, collapse of the airway and a limitation of expiratory gas flow can also become a significant factor (Grimby et al. 1971) , particularly if there is a tendency to exercise-induced bronchospasm; this can also be an issue for individuals with chronic respiratory disease. The maximal circulatory transport of oxygen depends on pulmonary venous blood being almost fully saturated with oxygen during its passage through the lungs; however, in some athletes, a poor matching of ventilation and perfusion may cause a significant desaturation of pulmonary venous blood during maximal effort (Gledhill et al. 1977) ; again, this is a problem that can also arise in chronic respiratory disease. In the central circulation, the maximization of stroke volume can be limited by poor venous tone and thus a limitation of venous return, as in vaso-regulatory asthenia (Holmgren 1967) ; this problem is most likely when a person is exercising in the vertical position, and is avoided when swimming. Maximal circulatory transport also depends on the peak heart rate; the maximal heart rate decreases with age, and it may also be limited by the administration of beta-blocking drugs. Athletes may attempt to boost their haemoglobin concentration and thus oxygen carriage per unit of cardiac output by high altitude residence (Stray-Gunderson et al. 2001) ; some also use tactics not sanctioned by athletic anti-doping organizations (such as autologous blood transfusion or the administration of erythropoietin to stimulate red cell formation). Conversely, anemia can compromise the volume of oxygen transported per unit of cardiac output. When exercising in an urban environment, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood may be reduced by exposure to carbon monoxide (Wright and Shephard 1978) . Again, the efficiency of circulatory transport depends upon the almost complete removal of oxygen from the capillaries within the active muscles. The capillary density per muscle fibre can be enhanced by training, thus tending to facilitate tissue diffusion and peripheral oxygen extraction; however, because of associated hypertrophy of the muscle fibres, Table 9 .2 Relationship between active muscle volume and peak oxygen transport (L/min) (Shephard et al. 1988b the average diffusion distance from the capillary to the muscle membrane is not necessarily diminished by aerobic training (Hermansen and Wachtlova 1971) . Finally, the ability of muscle to consume the oxygen that is delivered to it depends on local energy reserves, delivery of substrates and an adequate level of aerobic enzyme activity within the muscle mitochondria. One important factor influencing the blood transport of any gas is its effective solubility in blood. For oxygen, the sigmoid shape of the dissociation curve has long been recognized; the average solubility factor for oxygen, integrated between arterial and venous blood, is around five (Shephard 1969 (Shephard , 1970 . In contrast, for carbon dioxide, the dissociation curve is such that the effective solubility is only about a fifth of that for oxygen; in consequence, the conductances for carbon dioxide are more evenly distributed between the pulmonary and the circulatory systems (Shephard 1969 (Shephard , 1970 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 399, "end": 415, "text": "(Shephard 1967b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF359"}, {"start": 447, "end": 463, "text": "(Shephard 1966b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF357"}, {"start": 507, "end": 535, "text": "(Anderson and Shephard 1968)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 569, "end": 596, "text": "(Simmons and Shephard 1971)", "ref_id": "BIBREF409"}, {"start": 625, "end": 638, "text": "(Sutton 1992)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 656, "end": 669, "text": "(Wagner 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF447"}, {"start": 817, "end": 833, "text": "(Shephard 2010a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF383"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1149, "text": "(Shephard 1969", "ref_id": "BIBREF360"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1166, "text": "(Shephard , 1970", "ref_id": "BIBREF360"}, {"start": 2218, "end": 2232, "text": "(Macklem 1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF251"}, {"start": 2385, "end": 2412, "text": "(Killian and Campbell 1974)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2598, "end": 2618, "text": "(Grimby et al. 1971)", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 3081, "end": 3103, "text": "(Gledhill et al. 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 3351, "end": 3366, "text": "(Holmgren 1967)", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 3805, "end": 3834, "text": "(Stray-Gunderson et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF423"}, {"start": 4248, "end": 4274, "text": "(Wright and Shephard 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF467"}, {"start": 4721, "end": 4743, "text": "(Shephard et al. 1988b", "ref_id": "BIBREF403"}, {"start": 4867, "end": 4897, "text": "(Hermansen and Wachtlova 1971)", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 5402, "end": 5416, "text": "(Shephard 1969", "ref_id": "BIBREF360"}, {"start": 5417, "end": 5433, "text": "(Shephard , 1970", "ref_id": "BIBREF360"}, {"start": 5702, "end": 5716, "text": "(Shephard 1969", "ref_id": "BIBREF360"}, {"start": 5717, "end": 5733, "text": "(Shephard , 1970", "ref_id": "BIBREF360"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 128, "end": 136, "text": "(Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1176, "text": "Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1878, "end": 1886, "text": "(Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2123, "end": 2131, "text": "(Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 4634, "end": 4641, "text": "Table 9", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Factors Limiting Oxygen Transport"}, {"text": "Although the measurement of oxygen consumption has been greatly facilitated by introduction of the new metabolic equipment, the resulting gains in scientific knowledge are more debatable.

However, it is worth underlining that both the standardization of fitness test methodology that was conducted by the International Working Party (Shephard et al. 1968a (Shephard et al. , b, 1969 , and research on the oxygen conductance theorem (which identified the circulatory system as the primary bottleneck to oxygen transport during vigorous exercise, Shephard 1970) were completed using the classical Douglas bag approach.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 455, "end": 473, "text": "(Davis et al. 1980", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 890, "end": 912, "text": "(Shephard et al. 1968a", "ref_id": "BIBREF396"}, {"start": 913, "end": 939, "text": "(Shephard et al. , b, 1969", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1116, "text": "Shephard 1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF360"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interpretation of Metabolic Data"}, {"text": "A concept foreshadowed by the findings of the International Working Party was that the magnitude of an individual's peak oxygen intake depended upon the volume of muscle activated by the exercise test equipment.

In Noakes' view, this governor operates as a feed-forward control system that protects an athlete from exercising to a level that could cause tissue damage through either hypoxia or hyperthermia (Noakes and Marino 2009; Noakes et al. 2001) . Most Exercise Scientists would agree that athletes do limit their energy expenditure in prolonged endurance events, but they regard this as a pacing tactic that has been learned in collaboration with their coaches rather than as the operation of some shadowy Central Governor; the learned objectives of the competitor are to avoid depleting glycogen reserves too early in a prolonged event, and to limit a punishing build-up of tissue lactate until the final sprint.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 119, "text": "[kg.min]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 233, "end": 261, "text": "(Shephard and \u00c2 strand 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF392"}, {"start": 527, "end": 543, "text": "(Shephard 2009a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF381"}, {"start": 546, "end": 578, "text": "Nevertheless, Tim Noakes (1949-)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 741, "end": 753, "text": "(Noakes 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF281"}, {"start": 810, "end": 822, "text": "(Ulmer 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF437"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1200, "text": "(Noakes and Marino 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 1201, "end": 1220, "text": "Noakes et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF285"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interpretation of Metabolic Data"}, {"text": "Practical applications of maximal oxygen intake determinations at the present time include among other items (Shephard 2010a ):", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 124, "text": "(Shephard 2010a", "ref_id": "BIBREF383"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interpretation of Metabolic Data"}, {"text": "\u2022 Making National and regional comparisons of endurance fitness \u2022 Examining secular trends in endurance fitness \u2022 Evaluating the effectiveness of community and work-site fitness programmes \u2022 Establishing relationships between aerobic activity and chronic disease \u2022 Examining suitability of an individual for physically demanding employment \u2022 Obtaining an objective measure of training status and thus habitual physical activity \u2022 Prescribing an appropriate intensity of training exercise \u2022 Determination of the response to training \u2022 Monitoring of over-training and the course of rehabilitation \u2022 Determination of prognosis in cardiac disease", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interpretation of Metabolic Data"}, {"text": "The Post-Modern Era has seen considerable technical advances in electrocardiography, the use of ultrasound, and techniques for detecting obstruction of the coronary vasculature and injury of myocardial tissue.

Appearance of more than 0.2 mV of ST depression during a progressive exercise test has proven a useful warning that the myocardium is developing an excessive degree of hypoxia, and that it is an appropriate time to halt a progressive exercise test. It was initially hoped that the quantifying of exercise-induced ST depression might identify those apparently healthy individuals who were at particular risk of a heart attack, much as Master had proposed in his study of the recovery ECG following a simple step test (Chap. 8). However, a clearer understanding of Bayes theorem and the principles of biological screening quickly dashed such hopes. Bayes theorem was described many years ago by Thomas Bayes (1702 -1761 , a Presbyterian minister living in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. During the 1970s, clinical investigators began to apply this mathematical concept to a critical evaluation of various current and proposed biological screening procedures (Andermann et al. 2008; Wilson and Jungner 1968) . They soon appreciated that in a healthy population with a low prevalence of cardiac disease, the sensitivity and specificity of most exercise stress tests was such that an unacceptable proportion of patients would inevitably develop false positive test responses.

Dekker and colleagues (Dekker et al. 1974) introduced the refinement of a 3-dimensional echocardiogram. Sports Physicians quickly began to exploit echocardiography, both to evaluate the health of the heart in athletes where supposed abnormalities had been detected during mandatory ECG screening, and also to search for evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which some authors claimed was the commonest cause of sudden exercise-induced death in young athletes (Maron et al. 2009 ). However, the setting of appropriate goal-posts for diagnosing a pathological ventricular hypertrophy (such as the ratio of inter-septal to posterior wall thickness or end-systolic diameter) has remained a thorny problem.

However, this view had to be modified when it was pointed out that about a half of apparent interindividual differences in training response was simply an expression of laboratory errors in the measurement of maximal oxygen intake; the data obtained after training followed the well-known statistical principle of \"regression to the mean\" (Shephard 2003b; Shephard et al. 2004) , obscuring the training response in those with high values at the initial test, and exaggerating it in those with low initial values.

In the seventeenth century, Ramazzini (Chap. 6) noted that bakers, inn-keepers and soldiers were often required to work at unusual times of the day, and during the early part of the industrial revolution, workers also had to contend with very long hours of employment. But by 2001 CE, it was estimated that a fifth of European workers were engaged in shift work, and about one in 20 employees worked extended hours, sometimes associated with a compressed working week (Harrington 2001) . Adverse health effects that have been associated with shift work include a reduction in the quality and quantity of sleep, fatigue and resulting injuries, anxiety, depression and neuroticism, a 40 % increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease (possibly due to increased smoking, poor diet and lack of exercise, B\u00f8ggild and Knuttson 1999) , gastrointestinal disorders (again probably related to the poor diet available to shift workers), disruption of the menstrual cycle and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Studies of alternative shift arrangements have suggested that the least harmful is a rapid clockwise 8-h rotation (morning, afternoon, night); attention must also be paid to the recreational, dietary and transportation needs of the night shift, and the provision of bright lighting may possibly help night-time adaptation (Harrington 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1072, "end": 1089, "text": "(Harrington 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1432, "text": "B\u00f8ggild and Knuttson 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1935, "end": 1952, "text": "(Harrington 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disturbances of Circadian Rhythm"}, {"text": "Attempts to speed the adaptation of circadian rhythms by exposure to bright lights (an intensity of 5,000-12,000 lux) began in the early 1990s (Czeisler et al. 1990; Eastman 1992; Eastman et al. 1995) . Benefit was optimized if the light exposure continued for 6-8 h per night for 4 days before the shift of rhythm, and dark glasses were worn during the daytime to minimize exposure to natural sunlight. Although the secretion of melatonin is involved in setting the circadian rhythm, attempts to speed adjustments by therapeutic use of melatonin have had only limited success, in part because of side effects of the drug, and in part because of unfavourable pharmacokinetics when it is administered orally (Turek and Gillette 2004).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 165, "text": "(Czeisler et al. 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 166, "end": 179, "text": "Eastman 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 180, "end": 200, "text": "Eastman et al. 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disturbances of Circadian Rhythm"}, {"text": "We will examine briefly the attitudes of some recent governments to issues of health and fitness, focussing particularly upon the initiatives and personal lifestyles of leaders in the United States and Canada.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Attitudes of Governments and Political Leaders"}, {"text": "United States leaders during the Post-Modern Era have included Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, Bush Jr., and Obama.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "United States"}, {"text": "John Fitzgerald \"Jack\" Kennedy (JFK, 1917 (Fig. 9 .9) brought a deliberately youthful and athletic image to the Oval Office when he became U.S. President in 1961.

This legislation established a Directorate of Fitness and Amateur Sport, with a Minister of State under the general supervision of the Minister of National Health and Welfare. Because the Directorate was regarded as a junior ministry, the incumbent Minister was usually a young and ambitious politician, who remained in this particular office for only 1-2 years before moving on to a more prestigious Cabinet appointment. In order to make his or her mark, the emphasis of the Directorate was shifted with each new appointee. One incumbent thought it appropriate to focus upon the importance of sport programming, and the next emphasized the need to enhance the fitness of the general population. As in most government departments around the world, there were also frequent changes of name and administrative organization. In 1971 CE, two directorates (Sport Canada and Recreation Canada) were created within the Fitness and Amateur Sports Programme. Sport Canada was supposed to concentrate its activities on competitive sport at national and international levels, and Recreation Canada was charged with increasing the public's awareness of the importance of fitness and recreation in everyday life. Recreation Canada was renamed Fitness and Recreation Canada in 1977 CE, and two additional Directorates (Programme Operations and Administration, and Planning, Research and Evaluation) were created. The responsibilities of Recreation Canada now included programming for sport and recreational organizations, natives, and disabled persons, encouraging a healthy lifestyle through physical activity, and coordinating Federal fitness activities with those of the Provinces. The Fitness and Amateur Sport Directorate began its life with an annual budgetary allocation of $5 million. This allowed, among other initiatives, the creation of three University-based Fitness Research Units in 1963-1964 CE. Because of the regional realities of Canadian politics, it was decided to locate these units in Edmonton, Montreal and Toronto. Each unit received an annual grant of $50,000 for five years, at that time a budget that was sufficient to pay the salaries of two Academic staff, two technicians and a secretary, and to cover the purchase of a limited quantity of equipment and supplies. Doctoral programmes in the Exercise Sciences were quickly launched in both Toronto and in Edmonton, with Terence Anderson in Toronto becoming the first Canadian Ph.D. Exercise Science graduate, in 1966 CE. Another early initiative of the Toronto Fitness Research Unit, with the support of Fitness Canada, the Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation, the Ontario Heart Association and the Canadian Medical Association, was the hosting of the world's first International Symposium on Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Disease.

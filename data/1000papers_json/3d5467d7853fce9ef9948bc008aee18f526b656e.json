TLR4 expression was measured by using real time-PCR and Western blotting respectively. The results showed that, in the group B, the expression of TLR4 and the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the lungs were significantly increased, and the nitric oxide (NO) concentration was reduced, as compared with those in the group A (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Lung injury was aggravated with the increased expression of TLR4. When the inhibitor and stimulator of TLR4, namely L-Arg and L-NAME, were added respectively, lung injury was correspondingly relieved or aggravated (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In the group E, TLR4 expression was substantially lower and NO concentration higher than those in the group B (P<0.05 or P<0.01). However, in the group F, NO concentration was markedly decreased, and the inhibitory effect of CQ on TLR4 expression and the relief of lung injury were weakened when compared with those in the group E (P<0.05 or P<0.01).

Pancreatic damages and end-organ dysfunctions are both related to the severity of the inflammatory response [1] . Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of AHNP [2] [3] [4] .

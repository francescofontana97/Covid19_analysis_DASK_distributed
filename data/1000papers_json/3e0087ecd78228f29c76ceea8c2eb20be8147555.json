We focus on the popular Independence Cascade (IC) and Linear Threshold (LT) propagation models, along with the newly introduced Biased-PageRank (Biased-PR) algorithm. Let W be the set of crawled web pages, doms(W) the set of normalized SLDs in W, links(W) the set of crawled links between the domains in doms(W), and G(W) the corresponding graph with doms(W) as nodes and links(W) as edges. With link dom,dom we denote a link from domain dom to dom | dom, dom \u2208 doms(W), while inv(link dom,dom ) inverses the direction of a link and inv(links(W)) is the set of inverse links in W. Furthermore, for the links we assume that: Although the above assumption might not be precise, since links from a web page to another are not always of supportive nature (e.g., a web page critizing another linked one), or of the same importance (e.g., links in the homepage versus links deeply nested in a site), it suffices for the purposes of this first study of the model. Identification of the nature of links and the importance of the pages they appear is left as future work. Given that the assumption holds, part or whole of the support of dom regarding any AB can flow to dom through inv(link dom,dom ). Specifically, we define the Support Flow Graph as: Support Flow Graph (SFG) Definition. The SFG of a set of web pages W is the weighted graph that is created by inversing the links in G(W) (i.e., the graph with doms(W) as nodes and inv(links(W)) as edges). The weight of each edge is w dom,dom = outInvLinks(dom,dom ) So, given an SFG(W) and the seeds(AB sign(S) ) of an AB we can now describe how the support flows in the nodes of the SFG(W) graph.

In each iteration there is a history independent and non-symmetric probability of activating the neighbors of the activated nodes associated with each edge, flowing the support to the neighbors of the activated nodes in the SFG(W). This probability is represented by the weights of the links of an activated node to its neighbors, and each node, once activated, can then activate its neighbors. The nodes and their neighbors are selected in arbitrary order. Each experiment stops when there are no new activated nodes. After n runs we compute the average support score of nodes, i.e., sup(AB sign(S) , dom) \u2200 dom \u2208 doms(W). The algorithm is given in Algorithm 1.

Again, we use the support probabilities represented by the weights of the SFG links. The full algorithm, which is based on the static model introduced by Goyal et al. [10] , is given in Algorithm 2.

The biased surfer always starts from the biased domains (i.e., the seeds of an AB), and either visits a domain linked by the selected seeds or one of the biased domains again, with some probability that depends on the modeled behaviour. The same process is followed in the next iterations. The Biased-PR differs to the original PageRank in two ways. The first one is how the score (support in our case) of the seeds is computed at any step. The support of all domains is initially 0, except from the support of the seeds that have the value init seeds = 1. At any step, the support of each seed is the original PageRank value, increased by a number that depends on the behaviour of the biased surfer. We have considered three behaviours: (a) the Strongly Supportive (SS) one, where the support is increased by init seeds and models a constantly strongly biased surfer, (b) the Decreasingly Supportive (DS) one, where the support is increased by init seeds /iter, modeling a surfer that becomes less biased the more pages he/she visits, and (c) the Non-Supportive (NS) one, with no increment, modeling a surfer that is biased only on the initial visiting pages, and afterwards the support score is computed as in the original PageRank. Biased-PR differs also on how the biased surfer is teleported to another domain when he/she reaches a sink (i.e., a domain that has no outgoing links). The surfer randomly teleports with the same probability to a domain in any distance from the seeds. If a path from a node to any of the seeds does not exist, the distance of the node is the maximum distance of a connected node increased by one. Since the number of nodes at a certain distance from the seeds increase as we move away from the seeds, the teleporting probability for a node is greater the closer the node is to the seeds. We expect slower convergence for Biased-PR than the original PageRank, due to the initial zero scores of non-seed nodes. The algorithm is given in Algorithm 3.

The huge scale of the web graph has the biggest performance implication to the the graph-based computation of the ABs support. What is encouraging though, is that the algorithms are applied over the compact SFG graph, that contains the SLDs of the pages and their corresponding links. The complexity of IC is in O(n * |domsW| * |dom(links(W)|), where n is the number of experiments. LT is much slower though since we have to additionally consider the joint support of the neighbors of a node. Finally, the Biased-PR converges slower than the original PageRank, since the algorithm begins only with the seeds, spreading the support to the rest nodes. Also, we must consider the added cost of computing the shortest paths of the nodes from the seeds. For the relatively small SFG used in our study (see Sect. 6), the SS converges much faster than the DS and NS, which need ten times more iterations. For newly introduced ABs though, the computation of the support scores of the domains can be considered an offline process. Users can submit ABs and BCs into the bias goggles system and get notified when they are ready for use. However, what is important is to let users explore in real-time the domains space for any precomputed and commonly used BCs. This can be easily supported by providing efficient ways to store and retrieve the signatures of already known BCs, along with the computed support scores of domains of available ABs. Inverted files and trie-based data structures (e.g., the space efficient burst-tries [15] and the cache-consious hybrid or pure HAT-tries [2] ) over the SLDs and the signatures of the ABs and BCs, can allow the fast retrieval of offsets in files where the support scores and the related metadata are stored. Given the above, the computation of the bias score and the support of a BC for a domain is lightning fast. We have implemented a prototype 7 that allows the exploration of predefined BCs over a set of mainly greek domains. The prototype offers a REST API for retrieving the bias scores of the domains, and exploits the open-source project crawler4j 8 .

Currently, the bias goggles system is not able to pinpoint false positives (i.e pages with non supportive links) and false negatives (i.e., pages with content that supports a seed without linking to it), since there is no content analysis. We are certain that such results can exist, although we were not able to find such an example in the top results of our study. Furthermore, we are not able to distinguish links that can frequently appear in users' content, like in the signatures of forum members.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Experimental Evaluation Discussion"}, {"text": "In this work, we introduce the bias goggles model that facilitates the important task of exploring the bias characteristics of web domains to user-defined biased concepts. We focus only on graph-based approaches, using popular propagation models and the new Biased-PR PageRank variation that models biased surfers behaviours. We propose ways for the fast retrieval and ingestion of aspects of bias, and offer access to a developed prototype. The results show the efficiency of the approach, even in real-time. A preliminary evaluation over a subset of the greek web and a manually constructed gold standard of biased concepts and domains, shows promising results and interesting insights that need futher research.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and Future Work"}, {"text": "In the future, we plan to explore variations of the proposed approach where our assumptions do not hold. For example, we plan to exploit the supportive, neutral or oppositive nature of the available links, as identified by sentiment analysis methods, along with the importance of the web pages they appear in. Contentbased and hybrid approaches for computing the support scores of domains are also in our focus, as well as the exploitation of other available graphs, like the graph of friends, retweets, etc. In addition interesting aspects include how the support and bias scores of multiple BCs can be composed, providing interesting insights about possible correlations of different BCs, as well as how the bias scores of domains change over time. Finally, our vision is to integrate the approach in a large scale WSE/social platform/browser, in order to study how users define bias, create a globally accepted gold standard of BCs, and explore how such tools can affect the consumption of biased information. In this way, we will be able to evaluate and tune our approach in real-life scenarios, and mitigate any performance issues.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and Future Work"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "De-biasing user preference ratings in recommender systems", "authors": [{"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Adomavicius", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Bockstedt", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Shawn", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Zhang", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "In: CEUR-WS", "volume": "1253", "issn": "", "pages": "2--9", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Hat-trie: a cache-conscious trie-based data structure for strings", "authors": [{"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Askitis", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Sinha", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2007, "venue": "Proceedings of the Thirtieth Australasian Conference on Computer Science", "volume": "62", "issn": "", "pages": "97--105", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker? debiasing word embeddings", "authors": [{"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Bolukbasi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Chang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Zou", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "V", "middle": [], "last": "Saligrama", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Kalai", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2016, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Bias in algorithmic filtering and personalization", "authors": [{"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Bozdag", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2013, "venue": "Ethics Inf.

In order to describe/annotate crop phenological development stages in the newsletters, we need a specific semantic resource to semantically represent each stages. Several scales already exist to describe plant phenological development stages. BBCH, considered a reference, offers several sets of stages -one per crop called 'individual scales'-and a general one. The French Wine and Vine Institute (IFV) has aligned several existing scales in order to identify the most useful grapevine development stages for agricultural practices. Unfortunately these scales are not available in a semantic form preventing their use in agricultural semantic applications. In this paper, we present our work of creating an ontological framework for semantic description of plant development stages and transforming specific scales into RDF vocabularies; we introduce the BBCH-based Plant Phenological Description Ontology and we illustrate this framework with four scales related to grapevine.",

D2KAB's objective is to create a framework to turn agronomy and biodiversity data into semantically described, interoperable, actionable, and open knowledge. To build such a framework, we rely on semantic resources (e.g., terminologies, vocabularies, ontologies) to describe our data and publish them as Linked Open Data [10] . We use AgroPortal repository (http://agroportal.lirmm.fr) [17] to find, publish and share semantic resources then we exploit those semantic resources for applications in agriculture or environment. One of D2KAB's driving agri-food scenario is to build an augmented, semantically-enabled, reading interface for the official French agricultural alert newsletters, called Bulletin de Sant\u00e9 du V\u00e9g\u00e9tal (Plant Health Bulletins, later abbreviated PHB). The prototype will be developed with an archive of preexisting PHB PDF files semantically enriched -or annotated-using text mining techniques and transformed into linked data. The annotations will be described using the Semantic Sensor Network ontology combined with the Web Annotation Data Model as presented in [7] . References to phenology are frequently found in PHB, for instances, in order to identify the periods of grapevine sensitivity to abiotic factors (e.g., spring frost from bud break), or to biotic factors (e.g., diseases). In order to describe/annotate crops phenological development stages, we need a specific semantic resource to represent each stages and their relations for any specific crops but also interrelate similar stages between different crops.",

Unfortunately, these scales are not available in a semantic form (i.e., described with a semantic Web language such as SKOS, RDF-S or OWL) preventing their use in agricultural semantic applications, such as the one we want to develop for PHB. Indeed, our corpus of PHB shows different scales were idiosyncratically used to refer phenological development stages in observed plots. For example, in a grapevine related PHB, we find the sentence: bourgeon dans le coton (stade 03 ou B ou BBCH 05) dans les secteurs tardifs, which is both a reference to a 'label' (\"bourgeon dans le coton\" translated as \"bud in wool\") and a semi-formal mention to several scales: (i) 03 is a code from Eichhorn-Lorenz scale [18] ; (ii) B is a code from the Baggiolini scale [9] ; (iii) and BBCH 05 is a code from the BBCH-grapevine-individual scale [3] . These codes inside the text are first extremely hard to identify and second, they need to be transformed into a formal concept identifying the stage inside a semanticized scale. Plus, it appears the most frequent labels used are IFV's, but this scale does not offer any coding system (only labels). From our analysis and experience working on the PHB use case, there is a clear need to build a set of aligned vocabularies to semantically describe the stages of the different scales.",

BBCH describes several sets of development stages: one per plant species ('individual scales') and a general one [3] . The general scale forms the framework within which the individual scales are developed. It can also be used for plant species for which no individual scale are available: \u00ab The entire developmental cycle of the plants is subdivided into ten clearly recognizable and distinguishable longer-lasting developmental phases. These principal development stages are described using numbers from 0 to 9 in ascending order (...) The principal development stages alone are not sufficient to precisely define application or evaluation dates (...); Secondary stages are used when points of time or precise steps in plant development must be identified. Secondary stages are defined as short developmental steps (inside a principal stage) characteristic of the respective plant species. They are also encoded with a single digit. The combination of the principal and the secondary stages, results in a twodigit code -e.g., \"51\" stands for \"Inflorescence or flower buds visible\". The scale allows precisely defining all phenological development stages for the majority of plant species. \u00bb [3].

It initially had 10 stages that were completed in 1993 by Baillod and Baggiolini [9] to reach 16 stages. In 1977, Eichhorn and Lorenz (EL) proposed a more detailed scale of 24 stages for grapevine. In 1992, a universal scale known as BBCH for cultivated mono and dicotyledonous plants was proposed by Hack et al., then adapted to grapevine in 1995 by Lorenz et al. [18] . The BBCH grapevine individual scale allows comparison with other species, both annual and perennial, and has gradually established itself as a reference scale in the scientific community. In 1995, Coombe [11] proposed an alignment between the different existing scales for grapevine while proposing modifications to EL's. However, in the French agricultural technical community, different phenological scales are sometimes used according to the habits of the technicians and the territories. IFV had therefore produced a technical sheet [15] to synthesise the most useful and relevant grapevine development stages and their correspondences with the BBCH grapevine individual scale, the EL and the Baggiolini scales. The definitions of each stage were enriched by specific French expressions.",

PO however covers all plants; it contains standardized terms, definitions, and logical relations describing plant anatomy, morphology and development stages [26] . In PO, a development stage is represented as a class. A stage corresponds to a time interval in the growth of the corresponding plant structure. Thus, a shorter stage is defined as a subclass of a longer stage. A stage is related to a plant anatomical entity using has_participant object property. Some (49) references to the BBCH scale (or to other scales e.g. 38 references to Zadoks) can be found in the has_related_synonym annotation property. For example, the URI http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PO_0007086 corresponds to the stage at which five nodes or five internodes are visible. This stage corresponds to the BBCH stage 35. As most OBO ontologies, PO is based on the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) [6] and reuses some properties defined in the Relation Ontology (RO). Interesting object properties, such as precedes and preceded_by indicate that the end of a stage happens before the begining of another, but these properties defines some domain and range restrictions related to BFO constructs. Thus reusing these properties means reusing BFO constructs. PO, which was designed to annotate genomic and phenotypic data, is more detailed than the BBCH scale which was designed for agricultural practices and thus not really relevant for our use case.",

The BBCH monographs provided the information (labels and descriptions) in four languages (French, English, Spanish and German) for the general scale and the grapevine individual scale. Scientific publication of Baggiolini scale and the Eichhorn-Lorenz scale provided the information in English. And finally, IFV provided us with one CSV file gathering the information in French and English. Then, we extracted the data semiautomatically to different spreadsheets before loading them in the knowledge bases using Cellfie transformation rules. Cellfie was also used to generate individuals, each of them as an instance of one of the stage classes; transformation rules enabled to create links using object properties: ppdo:precedes, ppdo:follows, skos:broader, skos:broadMatch, skos:exactMatch, rdf:type. To improve the coherency of the final resource, we used a SWRL rule to inferred all inverse properties.

The type of mapping should be well studied due to the fact that the point of view between these two models are quite different: PPO and PO represent precise development processes of each plant organ, phenological development scales are just a snapshot of some typical plant development stages useful to schedule agricultural practices.",

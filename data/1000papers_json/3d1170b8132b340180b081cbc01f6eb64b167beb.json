Template switching plays crucial roles in retroviral replication and recombination, is used for adapter addition in RNA-seq, and may contribute to retroelement fitness by enabling continuous cDNA synthesis on damaged templates. Here, we determined an X-ray crystal structure of a template-switching complex of a group II intron RT bound simultaneously to an acceptor RNA and donor RNA template/DNA heteroduplex with a 1-nt 3'-DNA overhang. The latter mimics a completed cDNA after non-templated addition (NTA) of a nucleotide complementary to the 3' nucleotide of the acceptor as required for efficient template switching. The structure showed that the 3' end of the acceptor RNA binds in a pocket formed by an N-terminal extension (NTE) present in non-long-terminal-repeat (LTR)-retroelement RTs and the RT fingertips loop, with the 3' nucleotide of the acceptor base paired to the 1-nt 3'-DNA overhang and its penultimate nucleotide base paired to the incoming dNTP at the RT active site.",

We determined initial phases by molecular replacement, using the previously determined GsI-IIC RT structure as the search model (PDB: 6AR3; (24)) with the dATP and parts of the template strand removed to reduce model bias. Similar to the previously solved GsI-IIC RT structure, we encountered problems of crystal twinning, discussed in detail in the prior work (24). We were able to refine the structure to RWork and RFree values of 27.1% and 32.4% at 3.2-\u00c5 resolution with other collection and refinement statistics summarized in Table 1 . We were unable to crystallize the complex in the absence of dATP or with donor duplexes having a blunt-end or mismatched 3'-overhang nucleotide. These findings suggest that both base pairing of the 3' nucleotide of the acceptor to the 1-nt 3'-overhang nucleotide of the DNA oligonucleotide and binding of a dNTP complementary to the templating RNA base are required for the RT to form a crystallizable complex.",

Although most studies have focused on retroviral enzymes and other RTs found in eukaryotes, RTs are thought to have originated in bacteria, likely from an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), and large numbers of RTs persist there, either encoded by retrotransposons called mobile group II introns or as free-standing genomically encoded enzymes (5-9). The latter are related to group II intron RTs but have acquired cellular functions, including phage/host tropism switching, acquisition of RNA spacers in CRISPR-Cas systems, and contributions to multiple types of phage defense mechanisms (10) (11) (12) (13) . These bacterial enzymes provide an evolutionary perspective on the biochemical properties and biological functions of RTs, which are much wider than suggested by a narrow focus on retroviral RTs.",

Studies of template switching by retroviral RTs focused initially on its role in retroviral replication and recombination and more recently on its use for adapter addition in RNA-seq (1, (14) (15) (16) . Template switching by retroviral RTs is dependent upon base pairing between the donor and acceptor nucleic acids and falls into two mechanistically distinct categories: strand transfers, which require long base-pairing interactions between the donor and acceptor nucleic acids, such as those involving long-terminal repeat (LTR) sequences during retroviral replication, and end-to-end clamping, which typically requires only two to four base pairs and is dependent upon non-templated nucleotide addition (NTA) to a completed cDNA (17) (18) (19) (20) . Retroviral RT clamping is employed in a widely used high-throughput RNA sequencing method called SMART-seq for 5' RNA-seq adapter by template switching from the 5' end of an RNA template to a synthetic adapter oligonucleotide whose 3' end contains nucleotide residues complementary to those added by NTA to the 3' end of a completed cDNA (14) (15) (16) .",

An X-ray crystal structure of a full-length group II intron RT (the thermostable Geobacillus stearothermophilus GsI-IIC RT, sold commercially as TGIRT-III) bound to template-primer substrate and an incoming dNTP showed that these insertions contribute multiple additional contacts with RNA templates and more constrained binding sites for the templating RNA base, 3' end of the DNA primer, and incoming dNTP that could contribute to the relatively high fidelity and processivity of group II intron RTs (23, 24) . Structural cognates of all three of these distinctive regions are also found in RdRPs but are not present and presumed to have been lost from retroviral RTs, which evolved to evade host defenses by introducing frequent mutational variations and rapidly propagating beneficial ones by falling off one template and using the bound cDNA as a primer to reinitiate on another (24) (25) (26) .",

Since we were interested in mutations that might affect binding of the acceptor, we first examined the template-switching activity of the WT enzyme as a function of acceptor RNA concentration (Fig. 3) . To monitor binding of the acceptor and subsequent nucleotide incorporation, we used saturating dNTP concentrations with varying concentrations of a 21-nt acceptor RNA with a 3'-C residue and a fixed concentration of a donor RNA/DNA heteroduplex with a complementary 1-nt 3'-G DNA overhang (20 nM, substoichiometric relative to enzyme). Except for the fixed 1-nt 3'-G overhang, the donor duplex used for biochemical experiments corresponds to a version used for TGIRT-seq and is unrelated to the shorter donor duplex used for crystallization (see Fig. 3 legend and Table S1 ).",

Reaction time courses revealed a single predominant kinetic phase for the appearance of template-switching products, giving an observed rate constant (kobs) for each acceptor RNA concentration (Fig. 3B) . A fit of the observed rate constant as a function of acceptor concentration gave a maximal rate constant for template-switching (kTS) of 0.23 \u00b1 0.02 s -1 , in agreement with previous measurements done at saturating acceptor concentrations (0.25 s -1 (27) ). The observed rate constant approached this maximum value even with the lowest concentration of acceptor (50 nM) that could be tested while maintaining the acceptor in excess of the GsI-IIC RT-starter duplex complex. Within this limited concentration-dependent regime, the fit gave an estimated second-order rate constant (kTS/K1/2) of 0.014 nM -1 s -1 \u00b1 0.008. The latter value, also known as the specificity constant, represents the rate constant for acceptor binding multiplied by the probability of subsequent chain extension and was within 2 to 3 orders of magnitude of the diffusion limit, underscoring the efficiency of GsI-IIC RT for template switching (Fig. 3B ).",

We found that mutations in a conserved anchoring residue in the RT0 loop (I29R, Fig. 1C ) and in a conserved arginine in the fingers whose side chain H-bonds to a backbone carbonyl in the RT0 loop and the phosphate between T-1 and T+1 of the acceptor (R85A, Fig. 1C ) strongly inhibited template switching while retaining high primer extension activity (24) . By contrast, the mutation D30A, in another conserved residue that anchors the RT0 loop to the body of the protein, had no detectable effect on either template switching or primer extension (24) . Additionally, the RT0 loop mutant 23-28/6G, in which the six residues at positions 23-28 were replaced by six glycines, retained high template-switching activity, while the mutant 23-31/4G, with a shorter RT0 loop in which residues 23-31 were replaced by four glycines, substantially inhibited template-switching activity (24) . These findings suggested that the size and/or conformation of the RT0 loop might significantly impact template switching (24) .",

N23 was of interest as a conserved residue (Fig. 1C ) whose side chain sits between the phosphates on either side of T+1 in the continuous-template structure but shifts closer to the upstream phosphate in the template-switching structure, where a downstream phosphate is not present in the gap between the donor and acceptor (Fig. 2B ). This finding raised the possibilities that the N23 side chain could toggle between the two phosphates and that its interaction with the upstream phosphate could be particularly important for binding an acceptor RNA during template switching, where there is a discontinuity in the phosphate backbone. The adjacent residue Q24 makes a side-chain polar contact with the phosphate between P+6 and P+7 on the primer strand, potentially anchoring the donor duplex near the template-switching junction (see above).",

The mutation P68A is the sixth fingertips loop residue that makes a side-chain contact with the acceptor (a distant non-polar contact paper with the base of T-2) did not inhibit template switching in initial assays ( Fig. S4B) and was not subjected to more detailed analysis.",

To further investigate the contribution of NTA to template switching, we focused on F143, which is located in the dNTP binding pocket and may contribute to the selectivity of GsI-IIC RT for dNTPs by sterically blocking the 2' OH present in rNTPs (24, 33) . As in other RTs, the aromatic side chain of F143 is aligned for a pi stacking interaction with the deoxyribose sugar of the incoming dNTP (Fig. 6A) , and we hypothesized that this stabilizing interaction could be important for NTA, during which the added dNTP is not base paired with a templating nucleotide.",

A second RNA-seq adapter is then added to the 3' end of the completed cDNA by a single-stranded DNA ligation followed by minimal PCR amplification to generate the final TGIRT-seq library for sequencing (Fig. 7A ). For this method, it is desirable to maximize the efficiency of the initial template switch from donor duplex with a preformed 1-nt 3'-DNA overhang used for RNA-seq adapter addition, while decreasing secondary template switches from the 3' end of the completed cDNA, which result in chimeric reads that are typically discarded. The problem of multiple sequential template switches is most pronounced for TGIRT-seq of size-selected short RNAs, such as miRNAs (23, 36) . Although secondary template switches in TGIRT-seq can be suppressed by a high salt concentration (450 mM NaCl), high salt also decreases the efficiency of template switching from the initial starter duplex (35) , resulting in a lower yield of library product. A recently introduced modification of the TGIRT-seq method using a lower salt concentration (200 mM NaCl) for sequencing of human plasma RNAs resulted in < 5% soft clipped or discordant read pairs that could include secondary template switching (37), a manageable number but one that it would still be desirable to decrease further, as well as enable use of even lower salt concentrations to further increase the efficiency of the initial template-switching step.",

The F143A mutation did not increase the frequency of base substitutions or indels above the composite error rate for TGIRT-seq library preparation, oligonucleotide synthesis, PCR, and sequencing (Table S2 ).

Notably, the F143A mutation led to a marked decrease in the proportion of G residues for the first NTA at both dNTP concentrations (Fig. 7D ) and a concomitant decrease in secondary template-switching to acceptors with a complementary 3' C residue (Fig. 7E ).",

To test this hypothesis, we probed whether the complex formed after binding an acceptor with a 3' nucleotide complementary to the 1-nt DNA overhang is committed to extension or could exchange rapidly with an acceptor RNA from solution. In these experiments, we preincubated GsI-IIC RT with a saturating concentration of a 21-nt acceptor RNA and a donor template-primer duplex with a complementary 1-nt 3'-DNA overhang for 30 min to allow binding of the acceptor. We then initiated reverse transcription by adding dNTPs, with or without a 20-fold excess of a competitor 34-nt acceptor (Fig. 8A, top) . To preclude sequence biases for binding within the template-switching pocket from influencing the experiment, the longer acceptor had the same 21-nt 3' sequence as the shorter acceptor and differed only by the extra nucleotides at its 5' end.",

This experiment showed that when the 34-nt acceptor was present in excess from the beginning, it was used exclusively for template switching, whereas when the 21nt acceptor was present in excess from the beginning, the 34-nt was still present in > 50% of the template-switching products. This preferential binding of the longer acceptor RNA indicates that its 5' end can interact with additional sites on the RT outside of the template-switching pocket, likely patches of basic residues on the outer surface of the protein that are used for binding group II intron RNAs for RNA splicing and retrohoming (24) (Fig. 8C) . These findings account for a previously observed size bias against RNAs < 60 nt in heterogeneously sized RNA preparations in TGIRT-seq using GsI-IIC RT (37, 38) and suggest approaches for mitigating this bias by mutating basic surface residues that are not required for reverse transcription.",

This template-switching pocket is ordinarily occupied by upstream regions of a continuous RNA template but would become vacant when the RT reaches the 5' end of an RNA template or dissociates from a broken or damaged template, enabling template switching to the 3' end of a new acceptor RNA template for the continuation of cDNA synthesis.",

The NTE, which forms part of the template-switching pocket, is a common feature of non-LTR-retroelement RTs and viral RdRPs but is lacking and presumed to have been lost from retroviral RTs. A critical part of the NTE for template switching is the RT0 loop, a structured polypeptide linker which in GsI-IIC RT connects the two bent a-helices of the NTE and forms a lid over the RNA template backbone ( Fig. 2 and 4) . The RT0 loop sequence is conserved in group II intron RTs and partially conserved in non-LTR-retroelement RTs (Fig. 1C) . In GsI-IIC RT, conserved small amino acids at the N-terminus of the RT0 loop (G25 and A26) allow close approach and interaction of this portion of the lid with the RNA acceptor phosphate backbone. Most of the remaining conserved amino acids in the loop are hydrophobic residues involved in packing interactions with the fingers that anchor the middle and C-terminal end of the structured loop. In high-resolution crystal structures of two closely related apo-group II intron RTs (29) , the RT0 loop adopted the same conformation utilizing the same conserved interactions. Further, cryo-EM structures of the more distantly related Ll.LtrB and TeI4h group II intron RTs in complexes with group II intron RNA support a similar location for the lid and a packed RT0 loop in the absence of reverse transcription substrates (28, 30) . Collectively, these findings indicate that the structured RT0 loop conformation as seen in GsI-IIC RT is not dependent upon the presence of a nucleic acid substrate in the template-switching pocket. Additionally, the RT0 loop has the same configuration in the template-switching structure and the continuous structure, suggesting that it may not undergo large conformational changes during template switching.",

            "text": "We found previously that efficient template switching is dependent upon base pairing of the 3' nucleotide of the acceptor with a 1-nt 3'-DNA overhang representing NTA of a single nucleotide to the 3' end of the cDNA and that longer overhangs resulting from multiple NTAs were progressively less efficient, possibly reflecting the difficulty of matching two base pairs within the narrow confines of the template-switching pocket prior to initiating cDNA synthesis (27) . Here, we identified a mutation in a phenylalanine residue (F143A), which strongly inhibited NTA, while retaining relatively high primer-extension activity ( Fig. 6 and Fig. S1 ). F143 corresponds to a conserved aromatic residue (F or Y) that is present in in all RTs and forms a pi-stacking interaction with the deoxyribose of the incoming dNTP, while also serving to exclude rNTPs from the active site via a steric clash with the 2' OH of the rNTP ribose (24, 33, 39) . During NTA, when the incoming dNTP is not held in place by base pairing with a templating RNA nucleotide, the F143A mutant displays substantially decreased activity even at high dNTP concentrations, when compared to primer extension for which dNTP concentrations remain close to saturating (compare Fig. S1 to Fig. 6C and Fig. S5A ). Our finding that this mutation inhibited template-switching from the 5' end of a reverse transcribed template or a blunt-end donor RNA/DNA duplex ( Fig. 6C and D) , but not from a donor RNA/DNA duplex with a pre-formed 1-nt DNA overhang, confirms the necessity of NTA after the completion of cDNA synthesis for template switching to a new acceptor.",

We also found that the F143A mutation changes nucleotide preferences for NTA and concomitantly changes nucleotide preferences for template switching from the 5' end of one template to the 3' end of another, which are dependent upon base pairing of the nucleotides added by NTA to the 3' end of the new acceptor (Fig. 7, D and E) . As F143 corresponds to a conserved aromatic found in all RTs (33) , engineering of this residue to ablate, change, or optimize the pi-stacking interaction to modulate NTA might also be possible for retroviral and other RTs employed in RNA-seq methods such SMART-seq. Finally, our finding that longer RNAs out compete shorter RNAs with identical 3' ends indicates that the efficiency of template switching can be influenced by the binding of upstream regions of longer acceptor RNAs to secondary sites outside the template-switching pocket and accounts for the previously observed TGIRT-III bias against miRNA-sized RNAs in heterogeneously sized RNA preparations (36) . These secondary binding sites likely include patches of basic residues on the surface of group II intron RTs that are used for binding group II intron RNAs for RNA splicing and reverse splicing in retrohoming. These basic patches are not required for reverse transcription and thus should be dispensable and relatively easy to remove for RNA-seq applications (41, 42) .",

In group II intron RTs, the NTE appears to be predominantly a-helical, but the arrangement of the helices varies in known group II intron RT structures (28, 30) . The hypothetical RT0 loops of insect R2 and human LINE-1 related RTs share only a glycine residue, which lies outside of the lid sequence, and an aspartate residue (homologous to D30 in GsI-IIC RT), which appeared largely dispensable for template switching. Despite this lack of sequence conservation, mutating the RT0 loop in the Bombyx mori R2 element RT abrogated template switching activity (43) , similar to our findings for GsI-IIC RT. In contrast to the RT0 loop sequence, the hydrophobic, aliphatic residues that contribute to acceptor RNA binding in the fingertips region of the template-switching pocket of GsI-IIC RT are well conserved in non-LTRretroelement RTs (Fig. 1C) . Collectively, these findings together with other previous biochemical analyses of template switching by the R2 element RT (44, 45) suggest that group II intron and non-LTR-retroelement RTs use fundamentally similar template-switching mechanisms but that the structure of the NTE and template-switching pocket can diverge, possibly to accommodate the life cycle of different retroelements.",

Retroviral and LTR-retrotransposon RTs, which lack an NTE with an RT0 loop, perform analogous template switching termed clamping, yet typically require at least two base pairs of primer-acceptor overlap for efficiency instead of a single base pair as for group II intron RTs (19, 20) . Based on our findings for GsI-IIC RT, modeling suggests that the acceptor-binding surface for retroviral RTs consists of residues in the palm near the primer-acceptor overlap and hydrophobic residues in the fingertips loop in homologous positions to those found in GsI-IIC RT ( Fig. 9B) (19, 20) . The lack of any protein structure corresponding to the NTE/RT0 loop to sandwich the RNA acceptor may explain the necessity of at least one additional base pair and a larger binding surface on the palm for efficient clamping by retroviral RTs compared to group II intron RTs. Retroviral RTs can also template switch via strand transfer, but this process is more akin to primer extension, as the donor template is degraded by RNase H and the remaining cDNA base pairs to a complementary template (18) .",

            "text": "Finally, viral RdRPs, which are thought to be evolutionary ancestors of RTs, can template switch by an end-to-end mechanism analogous to clamping as well as by strand transfers that produce physiologically relevant subgenomic RNAs and enable recombination between viral RNA templates (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) . Structures of well-studied RdRPs, including HCV RdRP (4WTA (56) and SARS-Cov-2 RdRP (72CK (57) (Fig. 9 , C and D; see also PDB:2E9T (58), PDB:5TSN (59), and PDB:1S48 (60)) show a putative TS pocket composed of an RT0 loop cognate (termed motif G in RdRPs) and the fingertips loop on either side. The template-switching pocket homology between RdRPs and group II intron RTs suggests a common mechanism for binding the acceptor RNA template. Furthermore, small numbers of extra nucleotides at TS junctions for some viruses suggest a role for NTA similar to the mechanisms of retroviral and group II intron RT clamping (27, 52) . However, RdRPs lack an aromatic residue corresponding to the NTA-facilitating F143 in GsI-IIC RT, which would sterically clash with the 2' OH on the ribose ring of rNTPs, and instead use hydrogen bonds to the 2' OH to impart selectivity for rNTPs (33) . Additionally, in HCV RdRP, the mutation D225A in a residue that is part of a conserved hydrogen-bonding network that stabilizes the ASG loop, inhibits templateswitching but not primer extension or NTA, possibly by affecting interaction of the ASG loop with the acceptor RNA (54) . As with viral RdRPs, group II intron RTs typically possess homologs of both D225 (D144 in GsI-IIC RT) and the ASG loop (PQG loop in GsI-IIC RT with G192 contacting T-1 of the acceptor; Fig. 1B) , suggesting future avenues for investigating the effect of mutations in these residues on template-switching activity in these polymerase families.

Error rate were calculated for both the complete 21-nt template sequence and for a 13nt middle (core) sequence 5'-CTTCAGAGAGAAA to avoid errors near template-switching junctions, such as those due to mismatched base pairs, extra NTAs, or heterogeneity in the length of the synthesized oligonucleotides. Sequences of the 3 randomized nucleotides between two matched template sequences were used to calculate nucleotide frequencies, and the flanking sequence upstream of the first matched template in the read (the final cDNA in template-switching product) was used for NTA analysis. The scripts used for analysis (R script) and results were deposited under https://github.com/reykeryao/Alfred.",

Although this result could have indicated that the complex formed with the 34-nt acceptor is equally likely to dissociate or to go on to chain extension, it was also possible that the 34-nt acceptor RNA binds preferentially from solution, even though both acceptors have identical 3'-end sequences.",

This weak binding of the acceptor enables its rapid dissociation in the absence of a base pair with a complementary 1-nt 3'-DNA primer overhang added by NTA or provided by a starter duplex for RNA-seq.Remarkably, despite being dictated by only a single base pair, the template-switching reaction of GsI-IIC RT has high specificity, with RNA-seq showing 97.5-99.7% precise junctions depending upon the base pair(27). Our structure and kinetic analysis suggest that this high specificity reflects that after base pairing of the 3' nucleotide of the acceptor to the 1-nt DNA overhang, a second basepairing interaction between the templating RNA base and the incoming dNTP accompanied by a conformational change involving the fingertips loop results in initiation of reverse transcription, making the reaction with the matched acceptor irreversible.",

However, HBx is not an essential defense against tsAPOBEC3. Here, tsAPOBEC3 demonstrated a strong anti-HBV replication activity, and the exosome-mediated intercellular transfer of tsAPOBEC3 may amplify its antiviral response. Thus, we hypothesize that tsAPOBEC3 may limit the establishment of persistent HBV infection in tree shrews. This work provides information about the innate immune restriction factors in tree shrews and guidance for establishing tree shrew models of HBV infection.",

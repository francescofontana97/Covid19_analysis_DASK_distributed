This study is aimed at determining the factor structure of the knowledge, attitude, and practice questionnaire for the prevention of respiratory tract infections during Hajj by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Methods: A multistage cluster sampling method was conducted on Malaysian Umrah pilgrims during the weekly Umrah orientation course. A total of 200 Umrah pilgrims participated in the study. The knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) questionnaire was distributed to pilgrims at the beginning of the orientation and retrieved immediately at the end of the orientation. Data analysis was done using R version 3.5.0 after data entry into SPSS 24. The robust maximum likelihood was used for the estimation due to the multivariate normality assumption violation. A two-factor model was tested for measurement model validity and construct validity for each of the attitude and practice domains. Results: CFA of a 25-item in total, the two-factor model yielded adequate goodness-of-fit values. The measurement model also showed good convergent and discriminant validity after model re-specification. A two-factor model was tested for measurement model validity and construct validity for each of the attitude and practice domains. The result also showed a statistically significant value (p < 0.001) with \u03c7 2 (df) values of 76.8 (43) and 121 (76) for attitude and practice domains, respectively. Conclusion: The KAP questionnaire was proven to have a valid measurement model and reliable constructs. It was deemed suitable for use to measure the KAP of Hajj and Umrah pilgrims towards the prevention for all respiratory tract infections.",

Hajj is among the largest mass gathering in the world, with approximately 2 million pilgrims participating from different countries every year [1] .

On the other hand, Umrah also known as Lesser Hajj can be performed at any time of the year and is not obligatory on Muslims; however, is a highly significant religious practice [3] .",

Similarly, Saudi Arabia, being the sole host of the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage, has recorded 161,005 confirmed cases of COVID-19 resulting in more than 1300 deaths [8] . This has prompted Saudi Arabia authorities to initiate more proactive protective precautions such as temporary suspension of Umrah pilgrimage and limiting Hajj 2020 pilgrimage to only a few Saudi residents with strict guidelines on the rules of social distancing, the use of face mask and proper hand hygiene [9] [10] [11] .",

CFA is also a kind of structural equation modelling (SEM) that is related to measurement models [12] . The application of CFA is worthwhile to support the links connecting items and their respective domains. This permits the fixing of these relations in the measurement model and presents measures to evaluate the fit of the proposed theoretical model to the collected data [13] . Therefore, CFA is regarded as a vital means for validation in the social and behavioural sciences [12] . Measurement scale development involves numerous processes and protocols to establish its validity and reliability. The content and characteristics of the basic constructs and the choice of items to be included can also be established in a pilot study or adopted from a previous similar study and validated by CFA [14] . The application of improper measurement tools that are not validated can lead to inaccurate and misleading findings, resulting in a poor plan for interventions and therefore, too unreliable efficacy [15] . The Item Response Theory models (Rasch model) utilizes the principle of true Score models which comprises a collection of dogmatic formulae for systematic analysis to achieve the desired objective [16] .",

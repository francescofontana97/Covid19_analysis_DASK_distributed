A few days after the outbreak, its mental health team managed to develop a COVID-19 intervention protocol that was based on its previous experience during the 2013 Ebola crisis in Madrid (Rodr\u00edguez-Vega et al., 2015) and on the reports that were coming from China (Xiang et al., 2020) .

Community mental health centers have had almost a thousand more follow-ups this year (2019: 25,678; 2020: 26,790) , even when in-person appointments stopped a month ago.

There is no doubt that this has many implications in an emergency situation like the current one, especially for those countries most affected by the pandemic. But while there is no knowing how long this outbreak will last or if there is going to be another one, teleworking probably is here to stay, at least for a few months. As many healthcare workers are saying these days, what we thought would be a 100m sprint is actually turning into a marathon. Up to now, under the pressure of the avalanche of cases, our priority was to deliver a kind of \"first aid\" and to deliver it fast. But now we need to find empirical evidence that helps us put in place efficient measures for the protection of those who are the most vulnerable in this crisis.",

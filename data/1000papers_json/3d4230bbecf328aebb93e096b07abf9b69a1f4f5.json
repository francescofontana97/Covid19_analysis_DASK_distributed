            "text": "Context. Class II methanol masers are signposts of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs). Recent evidence shows that flares of these masers are driven by MYSO accretion bursts. Thus, maser monitoring can be used to identify such bursts which are hard to discover otherwise. Infrared observations reveal burst-induced changes in the spectral energy distribution -first and foremost a luminosity increase -which provide valuable information on a very intense phase of high-mass star formation. Aims. In mid-January 2019, flaring of the 6.7 GHz CH 3 OH maser (hereafter maser) of the MYSO G358.93-0.03 (hereafter G358) was reported. The international maser community (M2O) initiated an extensive observational campaign which revealed extraordinary maser activity and yielded the detection of numerous new masering transitions. Interferometric imaging with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA) resolved the maser emitting core of the star forming region and proved the association of the masers with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a hot molecular core. These observations, however, failed to detect a significant rise in the (sub)millimeter dust continuum emission. Therefore, we performed near-infrared (NIR) and far-infrared (FIR) observations to prove or disprove whether the CH 3 OH flare was driven by an accretion burst. Methods. NIR imaging with the Gamma-Ray Burst Optical/Near-infrared Detector (GROND) has been acquired and integral-field spectroscopy with the Field-Imaging Far-Infrared Line Spectrometer (FIFI-LS) aboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) was carried out on two occasions to detect possible counterparts to the (sub)millimeter sources and compare their photometry to archival measurements. The comparison of pre-burst and burst spectral energy distributions is of crucial importance to judge whether a substantial luminosity increase, caused by an accretion burst, is present and if it triggered the maser flare. Radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the dust continuum emission at multiple epochs provides valuable information on the bursting MYSO. Results. The FIR fluxes of MM1 measured with FIFI-LS exceed those from Herschel significantly, which clearly confirms the presence of an accretion burst. The second epoch data, taken about 16 months later, still show increased fluxes. Our radiative transfer modeling yielded major burst parameters and suggests that the MYSO features a circumstellar disk which might be transient. From the pre-burst, burst, and post-burst SEDs, conclusions on heating and cooling time-scales could be drawn. Circumstances of the burst-induced maser relocation have been explored. Conclusions. The verification of the accretion burst from G358 is another confirmation that Class II methanol maser flares represent an alert for such events. Thus, monitoring of these masers greatly enhances the chances of identifying MYSOs during periods of intense growth. The few events known to date already indicate that there is a broad range in burst strength and duration as well as environmental characteristics. The G358 event is the shortest and least luminous accretion burst known to date. According to models, bursts of this kind occur most often.",

However, the first piece of evidence for the unsteady growth of forming stars emerged by recognizing that the outburst of FU Orionis, which was thought to be a rare phase of early stellar evolution (Herbig 1966) , was instead an episode of enhanced disk accretion Hartmann & Kenyon 1985 . Since then, it has been realized that episodic accretion is an intrinsic feature of forming young stars (Hartmann & Kenyon 1996; Audard et al. 2014) . While this knowledge Based on observations collected at the European Organization for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere under ESO program 0103.C-9033(A). Based on observations made with the NASA/DLR Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) under Proposal IDs 75_0037 and 08_0163. had been established exclusively from observations of low-mass stars, which become optically visible while still accreting, it was unknown until recently whether high-mass stars (M 8 M ) show the same behavior during their formation. Their scarcity and fast formation timescales imply that they are still deeply embedded in their parental core while reaching the main sequence. This suggests that similar outbursts during high-mass star formation, if present at all, might be difficult to detect.",

The luminosity increase, seen at infrared (IR) and (sub)mm wavelengths for S255IR-NIRS3 and in the (sub)mm regime for NGC6334I-MM1, provided direct evidence for enhanced accretion rates. Most notably, these outbursts were accompanied by flares of Class II methanol masers (hereafter methanol masers; Fujisawa et al. 2015; Szymczak et al. 2018b; MacLeod et al. 2018 ). This confirmed a radiative pumping mechanism of this kind of methanol masers (Menten 1991a; Sobolev et al. 1997; Cragg et al. 2005) , which is consistent with variability studies of the maser emission (Szymczak et al. 2018a; Durjasz et al. 2019 ). Since methanol masers trace the very early stages of massive star formation (for example Breen et al. 2013) , maser flares might be taken as a proxy for accretion variability of the protostellar host. Keeping this in mind, the international maser community established the Maser Monitoring Organization (M2O) 1 to coordinate single-dish monitoring of masers and interferometric follow-up measurements.",

The kinematic distance amounts to 6.75 + \u2212 0.37 0.68 kpc which implies a galactocentric one of 1.6 kpc.

In mid-January 2019, flaring of the 6.7 GHz CH 3 OH maser line (Menten 1991b) in G358 was announced .

Interferometric imaging in the (sub)millimeter spectral range using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA) dissected the star forming region and pinpointed the MYSO which hosts the flaring masers . In all likelihood, the brightest continuum source MM1, which turned out to be a hot molecular core, experienced an accretion burst. For the first time, a spectacular confirmation of the event was achieved by high-resolution, multi-epoch observations of the 6.7-GHz methanol maser emission which revealed outward maser spot propagation, tracing the spread of the thermal radiation emanating from the burst (Burns et al. 2020 ). However, without evidence for a significant rise in (sub)millimeter dust continuum emission from MM1 , the energetics of the burst remained an open issue. Therefore, we aimed for observations to identify the IR counterpart of MM1 and to verify its luminosity increase, thus independently confirming the third MYSO accretion burst witnessed so far. 1 See M2O website at http://MaserMonitoring.org At present, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA, Erickson & Davidson 1993; Young et al. 2012 ) is the only facility which offers the capability to trace the far-infrared (FIR) flux increase caused by such an event. Consequently, an attempt was made for observing G358 with SOFIA which turned out to be successful. The observational results in context with supplementary data, the analysis and interpretation are the subjects of the present paper and will be outlined in the following.",

The measurements were performed on 2019 May 1, when the maser flare was still strong but already decaying (MacLeod et al., in prep.; Yonekura et al., in prep.) . Several spectral bands (see Table 2 ) were chosen to sample the full spectral range of FIFI-LS and, at the same time, cover high rotational transitions of the CO molecule. The spectral scan length per sub-band ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 \u00b5m. A regular follow-up proposal for SOFIA Cycle 8 was submitted and accepted as well. Due to the flight suspension induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the observations were delayed and eventually performed on 2020 August 28. The same settings and amount of observing time as for the first epoch measurements were used. However, because of a technical issue, no data could be obtained in the blue channel. Yet, drawing conclusions on the flux evolution from the two epochs became possible.",

Because of its brightness in both filters bands, G358 led to small (W1) or mild (W2) detector saturation. In this case, the derivation of the brightness from the wings of the point spread function (c.f. section IV.4.c.iii of the WISE All-Sky Explanatory Supplement, Cutri et al. 2012) leads to enhanced scatter. Nevertheless, the discovery of an obvious brightening which usually accompanies enhanced accretion should have been possible. However, there is no clear-cut evidence in both light curves for a flux increase at the burst epoch or later on. From the scatter of the photometric values, a possible increase due to the burst can be constrained. Assuming a 2\u03c3 detection limit for W1 and W2 of \u223c 0.5 mag, that is a joint 2.8\u03c3 limit, upper bounds for a possible flux contribution caused by the burst can be derived as 0.10 Jy and 0.45 Jy, respectively.

The burst SED features flux densities larger than a factor of 2 when compared to the pre-burst ones and a possible change of the SED shape. Thus, a luminosity increase -the prime signature of an accretion burst -has been witnessed with SOFIA. It represents the second confirmation of such an event after the S255IR-NIRS3 burst (Caratti o Garatti et al. 2017) using this unique facility. Given the non-detection in the NIR and MIR as well as the non-significant flux increase in the (sub)mm ) this promotes the G358 event to be the first NIR-, MIR-and (sub)mm-dark but FIR-loud MYSO accretion burst. While the second epoch SOFIA observations suffer from the lack of the blue FIFI-LS bands, which sampled the flux density at wavelengths short-ward of the SED peak, the red channel data (green symbols in Fig. 4 ) nevertheless unambiguously indicate elevated flux levels during the post-burst stage compared to preburst and depressed compared to the bursting stages.",

The fits, reddened to match the observations, are shown as solid lines in Fig. 4 .

For the parameters which are log-spaced in the Robitaille model pool (r min , r max , M dust disk , L via R , T ), we use the geometric mean, while for all other parameters, we use the arithmetic mean.

Before describing this analysis, a remark must be made concerning the interstellar extinction A V which is a free parameter of the SED fitter. Because of the wavelength dependence of the dust optical properties, extinction is most pronounced at short wavelengths. Thus, for SEDs like that of MM3 it can be well constrained by the best models. However, for the SED of MM1 which is almost exclusively defined by FIR and (sub)mm measurements, interstellar extinction is less influential and, therefore, harder to derive. Since higher A V implies larger source luminosities to reproduce the observed fluxes, an upper limit needs to be established to constrain L. The recalibration of a Galactic dust-reddening model based on IRAS and COBE/DIRBE results by Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) suggests a value of A V = 115 \u00b1 4.2 mag along the sight line toward G358. Since this holds for the whole path across the Galaxy, while G358 is in front of the Galactic center region, the actual A V will in fact be lower.

For these models, the inner radius of the dust disk corresponds to the sublimation radius R sub . This constraint seems to be justified given the high accretion rates at which massive stars form (for example Zinnecker & Yorke 2007; Kuiper et al. 2016) , and in particular before and during an accretion burst. It requires a few remarks concerning the understanding of \"heating\" and \"cooling\" in this case, since the dust disk cannot get any hotter than the sublimation temperature. What happens due to a luminosity increase is that enhanced dust sublimation at the inner rim R sub pushes the latter outward. This is accompanied by an adjustment of the temperature profile T (r) via absorption and re-emission such that, for a given radius (beyond the actual R sub ), the temperature exceeds the previous value. Conversely, for a given temperature, the growth in radius implies a larger radiating area and, therefore, leads to a flux increase. The reverse process happens once the burst ceased. R sub will shift back inward, allowing the dust replenishment by accretion and/or dust reformation. This will lead to a flux decrease and might be considered as \"cooling\" but, yet, the inner rim is still at the dust sublimation temperature.",

Inclination, interstellar extinction and the distance were set to the values of the underlying model from the pre-burst-fit since none of these parameters is expected to change during the burst. Additionally, the original pre-burst-SEDs are included. Since the inner disk radius is governed by the dust sublimation temperature, assumed to be 1600 K, it shifts outward for those models with increasing luminosity. Otherwise, the system geometry is kept the same. While this ignores possible changes of the disk due to the burst, for instance in the density structure, it is the simplest approach to model the dust continuum emission due to the accretion burst, and feasible to be treated using common RT codes which are generally static. While a proper burst modeling requires time dependent RT, possibly coupled to hydrodynamics for utmost consistency, our simplified treatment nevertheless allows us to draw major conclusions.",

The post-burst is observed only at wavelengths greater than 118 \u00b5m, meaning that there are no constraints in the MIR. Since the maser flux did not fall below its pre-burst level until now (MacLeod et al., in prep.; Yonekura et al., in prep.) , we assume that the post-burst flux in the MIR is also not below the pre-burst level. Therefore, models from the post-burst fits that have MIR fluxes below those of the mean pre-burst model were excluded. An aperture size of 3 has been applied in for the fits. With this choice the \u03c7 2 -value of the pre-burst fit becomes smallest. All obtained parameters are stable against a variation of the aperture size (they agree within their respective errors).",

(2020b) with i = 25 \u00b1 10 \u2022 . The stellar radius amounts to 8.4 + \u2212 15.7 5.5 R . It has been obtained from the pre-burst-models alone. The burst might cause an increase in the stellar radius (bloating) although it is unclear, whether the protostar will respond on time scales of a few months. The models show a considerable scatter in the derived disk properties. The derived outer radii are between 140 and 3800 au, with a mean value of 950 + \u2212 1500 580 au. The favored dust mass of the circumstellar disk is as low as 8.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M , where the 1\u03c3-confidence interval extends from 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 to 6.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M . Using the appropriate gas-to-dust mass ratio (see Sec. 5.2.1) this corresponds to a most probable total disk mass of 3.2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M within an uncertainty range of 4.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 to 0.24 M . Remarkably, the corresponding total disk masses are lower, and mostly much smaller, than those derived for MYSOs from SED fitting (for example Kraus et al. 2010; Johnston et al. 2015) . Among the best models there is only one (90Yt0exl_03) with a total disk mass of 1.4 M which is not that much below present estimates. In contrast to MM3, the much higher scatter of the disk mass of MM1 compared to the other log-spaced parameters indicates that it cannot be reliably estimated by the fitter. In other words, a substantial flux contribution from a disk is not necessarily required to reproduce the SEDs. Thus, while we cannot reliably estimate its mass, we may conclude that the disk is quite likely lightweight.",

The \u03c7 2 -values of the burst models are about 5 times higher than for the pre-burst. This might be related to the scatter in the FIFI-LS data, to a coarser sampling of the model-parameters (because of the fact that we only consider models that fit the pre-burst SED pretty well), and to differences in comparison to the static case (whereas the preburst-system most probably is stationary, this does not hold for the post-/bursting stage).

At first, we use this approach to obtain mass and radius estimates which reproduce the MM1 pre-burst luminosity, (Tout et al. 1996) , respectively. The accreted mass is inferred from E acc = GM * M acc /R * , where G is the gravitational constant, M * is the stellar mass, M acc is the accreted mass, and E acc the released energy derived in the previous section.

While cosmic ray sputtering of dust grain mantles can also release methanol to the gas phase (Dartois et al. 2020 ), thermal desorption due to grain heating will be the dominant process near the MYSO. It requires temperatures of at least 94 K (Luna et al. 2018) while the maximum desorption rate is reached at about 120-125 K (Collings et al. 2004 ). For such temperatures, the peak flux of the thermal IR radiation from the warm dust is in the proper wavelength range needed to excite these masers (Ostrovskii & Sobolev 2002; Cragg et al. 2005) . The RT models of MM1 during the pre-burst, burst, and post-burst epochs described in Sec. 5.2.2 yielded spatial dust temperature distributions which can be used to address which regions of the circumstellar environment are potential sites of Class II 6.7 GHz methanol masers, and how they change due to the burst. Figure 8 shows the central part of temperature distribution of the mean model in the first quadrant of the x-z plane for the pre-burst (left), burst (middle) and post-burst (right) epochs. The white lines mark the following gas densities n H 2 = [1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2] \u00d7 10 8 cm \u22123 (density decreases with z).

The situation is different for the burst epoch (Fig. 8 center). As expected, the methanol snow line moved outward and is located at about 1000 au. At the same time the region below the disk/envelope surface has become warmer and presumably got enriched with gaseous methanol. These conclusions from the RT modeling can be compared to the multi-epoch VLBI observations of the expanding maser ring (Burns et al. 2020; Burns et al., in prep.) . The vertical dashed black lines mark the circumference of the maser ring from the first and 4th VLBI epoch. The first epoch observations were obtained already two weeks after the flare started. It is reasonable to assume that during the very early flare rise the excitation conditions were not too far off the pre-burst case. In fact the location of the maser circumference during the first epoch is within the region where phase transition from the solid to the gaseous methanol seems to occur in the pre-burst state. The data of the fourth VLBI epoch was taken about three weeks after the first FIFI-LS observations (\"burst\" epoch). The maser circumference at that time is confined to the desorption temperature interval for regions not too far off the disk plane. The fact that the extent of the maser ring matches the expected maser positions for both epochs suggests that our RT modeling, although static, nevertheless describes major changes of the circumstellar environment due to the burst properly.",

For this purpose, the mean model SEDs for burst and post-burst were normalized by the pre-burst model SED. It has to be kept in mind that dividing the flux values cancels the extinction correction. The result is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 9 . It can be seen that the peak values of the relative flux m exceed the luminosity gains derived in the previous section. For our MYSO models, the largest relative flux For their low-mass YSO models, the maximum flux ratio shifts toward the FIR for stronger accretion bursts. The least relative flux increase occurs in the (sub)mm. This is because the emission in this part of the spectrum arises from the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the Planck function, where the spectral radiance only linearly depends on temperature. Since the temperature increase of the outer circumstellar regions is lower than for the inner ones, their flux increase is accordingly smaller. The wavelength dependence of the relative flux increase agrees qualitatively with that of the outburst of OO Serpentis (OO Ser), as found by the first YSO outburst monitoring which covered the full wavelength range from NIR to FIR (K\u00f3sp\u00e1l et al. 2007 ). These observations also revealed a wavelength-dependent time shift of the peak brightness which had not been witnessed for other eruptive YSOs before.",

From our SED fits, we can assess this issue in a \"semiempirical\" manner for the whole wavelength range of the SED.

The indices x, y denote the respective epoch pairs and \u2206t is the corresponding epoch difference (in years). The upper curve holds for the flux rise while the lower one for the flux decrease.

First of all, our assessment of the correlated flux variability is based on YSO models with passive disks. The viscous energy release in an active disk leads to a temperature distribution that differs from the passive case in particular in the innermost region.

The G358 event is compared to the previous cases. Before we address individual topics, we note for completeness, that our investigation only covers the surplus dust continuum emission caused by the accretion burst. While the fraction of the energy consumed by phase transitions (sublimation of grain ice mantles, dust evaporation and dissociation of molecules) is negligible in the present context, it nevertheless seriously affects the chemistry of the YSO (Rab et al. 2017; Wiebe et al. 2019 ). Figure 6 shows that the best burst and post-burst fits predict (sub)mm fluxes that exceed the measured values. The observed values, indicated by the red and green symbols at \u03bb = 889 \u00b5m amount to 60-70% of the respective mean burst and post-burst model. Since attempts to solve this discrepancy failed or required non-plausible assumptions, for instance on grain properties or geometry, we conclude that this mismatch indicates a deviation of the temperature distribution of the circumstellar environment from the static case. The accretion burst causes an additional inside-out heating of the circumstellar environment where inner regions try to reach a new thermal equilibrium while outer ones are still in the previous steady-state. Time-dependent RT simulations suggest that the heating timescales strongly increase with wavelength (Harries 2011; Johnstone et al. 2013) . Since the MM1 SEDs are dominated by the increased FIR fluxes, their fits will, therefore, yield over-predicted (sub)mm fluxes.",

            "text": "It was mentioned above that the ZAMS values for R * might not apply since the high accretion rates during the growth of a massive protostar will temporarily bloat its radius which could then be many times larger than that of a main sequence star (Hosokawa & Omukai 2009; Hosokawa et al. 2010) . Recent simulations suggest that bloating is even intensified by accretion bursts (Meyer et al. 2019a) . As a consequence of bloating, more mass needs to be accreted to produce the observed luminosity increase. In the cold disk accretion model of Hosokawa et al. (2010) , the protostellar swelling occurs in the mass range between 5-9 M . Since the mass of MM1 is likely of that order, the supposition of being bloated is perhaps valid. If so, the accretion rate may be elevated as it is proportional to the stellar radius. Unfortunately, due to the high extinction of deeply embedded protostars, it is hard to derive their surface gravity from photospheric absorption lines because of strong veiling. Only recently this has been achieved for the first time. The MYSO G015.1288-00.6717 shows an A-type spectrum with a relatively low surface gravity, pointing to a bloated protostar (Pomohaci et al. 2017) .",

For a MYSO in a relatively evolved stage, like S255IR-NIRS3 which shows a flat pre-burst SED, the derivation of an accretion rate using the ZAMS approach seems to be justified. However, its application to MYSOs in earlier stages, like G358 or NGC6334I-MM1, is questionable. In addition, the ZAMS approach has its own challenges because, unlike low-mass stars, massive stars arrive on the ZAMS while accreting. Therefore, their pre-burst luminosity includes a likely small but unknown fraction of accretion luminosity. For low-and intermediate mass-stars, accretion rates can be derived from emission-line tracers (for example Mendigut\u00eda et al. 2011) which, however, might be only exceptionally seen in scattered light from MYSOs (Neckel & Staude 1995) .",

Given their distances, high spatial resolution obtained by interferometric observations is required to resolve the individual components of MYSOs like G358 or to prove their single nature. For less embedded objects, this can be achieved with the VLTI in the thermal IR, while for deeply embedded sources (sub)mm interferometers like NOEMA or ALMA have to be used. FIR interferometry, which requires groups of satellites in space, does not yet exist, although it has been envisaged (Linz et al. 2020) . Keeping in mind that MYSOs emit the bulk of their energy in the FIR, the coarse spatial resolution in the FIR implies that in most if not all cases, their luminosities consist of individual contributions. Thus, relating the luminosity increase caused by an accretion burst of single source to the total pre-burst luminosity only yields a lower limit to the burst strength. In case of G358 the luminosity gain derived from the graybody fits of pre-and burst total fluxes amounts to 2.5 while the RT results based on the SED decomposition (see Sec. 5.1) yielded a value of 4.7 for MM1.",

So the question arises how does it come that elevated FIR emission is still present after 18 months past the flare peak? The current notion is that dust cooling should be quick because of the low optical depth at those wavelengths. The bulk of the FIR/(sub)mm emission comes from outer regions of the circumstellar environment. Thus, their optical depth toward the observer is low indeed. However, this is not necessarily the case for the optical depth toward the protostar where the energy is being released. An effective optical depth of a few will slow down the heating of the outer YSO environment and \"trap\" burst energy in the dusty medium. The latter will be radiated away and cause elevated FIR emission for quite some time after the burst terminated. Evidence of post-burst elevated FIR emission has been found for the OO Ser event (K\u00f3sp\u00e1l et al. 2007 ) and by us for S255IR-NIRS3 (Stecklum et al., in prep.) .

The different propagation speeds along those lines incur a broadening of the heating duration. A subluminal speed (0.04. . . 0.08 c) of the heat wave during the burst has been witnessed in G358 by tracing, for the first time, the outward motion of maser spots (Burns et al. 2020) .

Among the possible causes, erratic infall from a protostellar envelope (cf. Vorobyov & Basu 2015; Meyer et al. 2017 ) seems to be favorable for a MYSO in an evolutionary stage as early as G358. Interestingly, recent high-resolution radio imaging of MM1 suggests the presence of two spiral-arm accretion flows, winding toward the protostar as traced by methanol masers Chen et al. 2020b) . This is in line with very high-resolution ALMA imaging of high-mass protostars that provided evidence for filamentary streamers pointing onto the central sources (Goddi et al. 2018; Johnston et al. 2020) . These might represent multidirectional accretion channels which possibly inhibit the formation of a large, steady disk at the very early stages of massive star formation. Thus, the small disk mass suggested by our best RT SED fits may be seen as a hint for the extreme youth of MM1. Possibly, its environment is not relaxed enough to allow the formation of a larger sustainable circumstellar disk. Such a disk might be prone to gravitational instability, considered to be another cause for episodic accretion (Vorobyov & Basu 2015) . Faint radio continuum emission from MM1 has been detected during the burst as well (Bayandina et al., in prep.) . Whether it is variable and perhaps related to an active disk needs to be explored.",

This allows us to compare the derived quantities with the results obtained for S255IR-NIRS3 (Caratti o Garatti et al. 2017), which is the first step toward a statistics of MYSO burst properties. Assuming a ZAMS star, an accreted mass of \u223c 3.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M has been estimated for S255IR-NIRS3. The corresponding accretion rate amounts to 5 \u00b1 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M yr \u22121 . While these values will likely be revised once the comprehensive monitoring data set has been analyzed, we can assume that their order of magnitude is correct. The accretion rate of the G358 burst almost corresponds to that of the S255IR-NIRS3 event. However, the accreted mass is about one order of magnitude smaller due to the shorter duration of the burst. Thus, compared to S255IR-NIRS3, the G358 burst was a minor one. Simulations of MYSO accretion (Meyer et al. 2019b) suggest that minor bursts similar to that of G358 are much more frequent compared to major ones, and occur predominantly at very early stages of protostellar evolution. We emphasize that the above-mentioned disk accretion rates during the burst are at least an order of magnitude larger than those derived from SED modeling of non-bursting high-mass protostellar objects (Fazal et al. 2008; Grave & Kumar 2009 ).",

Since no excess emission associated with the burst was detected in NIR, MIR or (sub)mm observations, it represents the first NIR-, FIR-and (sub)mm-dark but FIR-loud MYSO accretion burst. -By means of the SED decomposition approach actual luminosity estimates of the driving source of the accretion burst could be obtained which yielded more representative burst parameters. -From the change of the luminosities at the two FIFI-LS epochs the decay-time time of the FIR excess emission could be determined. This yielded more reliable estimates of the burst energy and the derived parameters. Moreover, wavelength-dependent rates for the rise and fall of the relative fluxes could be obtained. -The circumstellar disk of MM1 is less massive than those found for other MYSOs and possibly transient. This may be an indication of the extreme youth of the source. -A comparison with previous MYSO bursts indicates a considerable range of burst characteristics. The burst of G358is the least energetic of the small sample. -The RT modeling allowed us to draw conclusions on the possible sites of maser excitation and their relocation due to the burst which seem to be supported by VLBI radio observations. -As already demonstrated for the S255IR-NIRS3 event, the G358 results underline once more that the observational capabilities of SOFIA in the FIR are of utmost importance to study the erratic growth of stars.",

When also omitting the WISE W4 and MIPS 24 \u00b5m measurements (yellow), the best fit (blue) lies above the nominal one. This confirms that the FIR emission of MM3 and, thus, its contribution to the total FIR fluxes, is well constrained by the WISE, MIPS and ALMA measurements.",

G358-SOFIA Table A .7. Optical depth in the V-band for the ten best MM1 pre-burst models along the mid-plane and along the line of sight toward the center. The intrinsic extinction dominates the total extinction (including the interstellar extinction) by far, as indicated by the huge values in the Vband. For \u03c4 mid\u2212plane the contribution of the disk is given separately. For some models, \u03c4 disk almost covers the total extinction (along the line of sight), whereas for some models the contribution of the envelope (which is the same as \u03c4 mid\u2212plane total \u2212 \u03c4 mid\u2212plane disk ) is the dominant one. We note that the optical depths are given for the pre-burst, during the burst the optical depths may be slightly lower because of dust sublimation. ",

For routine clinical care in different circumstances, it is relevant to assess the COVID 19 status of patients. Routine PCR is recognized as the gold standard but can be falsely negative due to sampling errors. For diagnosing and monitoring adult COVID 19 patients, characteristic radiological lesions have been recognized [1, 2] and to assess the possibility of COVID 19 infection in adults scheduled for surgery in whom a PCR test is negative or missing, a non-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) scan has been proposed as an option in the Netherlands [3] because: (1) Patients may be pre-symptomatic in the incubation period of a COVID 19 infection and subsequently develop symptoms postoperatively, implying a greater risk for adverse post-operative outcomes; (2) Patients may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers and shedders of COVID 19, and place hospital workers and other patients at risk.",

This resulted in 92 papers that mostly focused on the use of CT scans in diagnosing and/or monitoring the disease or its severity [1,2] rather than ruling it out. Most studies did not include subjects with negative PCR, so the true negative rate or specificity of CT scanning could not be calculated; instead we focused on sensitivity, the ability of chest CT to recognize as many patients as possible.",

From that study it was unclear at what moment in the course of disease diagnostic tests were conducted. Chest CT in more advanced disease is associated with more abnormalities [4, 13] , and especially so in selected clinical populations [8] . In those series, the positive and negative predictive values of the CT scan were 65% and 83%, respectively. Also from another study in a highly epidemic region 82% of patients with mild symptoms had chest CT abnormalities. [9] Such results may only be valid in epidemic areas with high pre-test probability for this disease, and one should not assume similar sensitivity of chest CT in a general population for screening purposes [7, 8] With a prevalence of disease of about 60% as in Wuhan, the positive and negative predictive values were 65% and 83%, respectively. However, in an area with a lower or higher prevalence the positive and negative predictive values will differ (figure 1).",

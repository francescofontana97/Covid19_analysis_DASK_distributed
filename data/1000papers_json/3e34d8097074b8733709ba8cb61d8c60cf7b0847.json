In other cases, they will indicate the need for more advanced imaging (e.g. wall motion and quantitative valvular assessment). Therefore, these images should be saved and archived whenever possible.

Although SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to most standard viricidal disinfectant solutions, care must be taken when cleaning.Local standards vary, but echocardiogram machines and probes should be thoroughly cleaned, ideally in the patient's room and again in the hallway. Smaller, laptop-sized portable machines are more easily cleaned, but use of these machines should be balanced against potential tradeoffs in image quality and functionality. Please consult vendors' disinfecting guidelines available on their websites, as procedures vary and could affect the functionality of machines. TEE probes should undergo cleaning in the room (including the handle and chord), then be transferred in a closed container to be immediately disinfected according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

            "text": "The performance and interpretation of echocardiographic studies, especially those in suspected or confirmed COVD-19 cases, should be limited to essential personnel. For TEEs, practices may vary, but there should be at most one person to handle the probe and another to operate the12 American Society of Echocardiography ASEcho.org machine controls, along with another to administer sedation. Medical education remains important, and echocardiographic practitioners play a crucial role in teaching essential components of cardiovascular medicine, as well as scanning and interpretation skills, to a wide variety of learners. Medical and sonography students, residents, fellows and practicing physicians gain knowledge and experience through rotations on echocardiography services, through observing the performance of studies, hands on scanning and reading with experts. In the current environment, however, elective rotations should be suspended, and restrictions should be placed on trainees who are not essential to clinical care. In many institutions, advanced trainees (e.g., fellows) provide crucial off-hours scanning and interpretation but must follow all applicable procedures to reduce infection transmission. Training and education can be moved \"on-line\". The ASE and others provide multiple educational offerings, including webinars and lectures. A variety of simulators are available to teach scanning skills without involving patients.",

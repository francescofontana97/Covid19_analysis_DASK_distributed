            "text": "The emergence of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has raised a global issue and a pandemic disease outbreak, COVID-19, was declared by the World Health Organization on March 12 th , 2020. The new virus is rapidly spreading in humans and cases of severe acute respiratory syndromes are being reported worldwide. Health authority advisors and governments from small towns to large countries need to quickly manage and deal with growing epidemiological data on a daily basis. In this work, current available data from reported cases and deaths over time were analyzed and treated. Lethality has been calculated by finding linearization of death cases against reported ones, using a time-delayed data transposition. A two-wave statistical model, 2WM, based on the superposition of normal distributions was used to fit current data and to estimate the evolution of infections and deaths, using Microsoft \u00ae Excel. The model showed good agreement even for apparent single wave behavior in some countries and can easily be extended to any number of waves. A gamma distribution was used as a risk function to estimate death probability from patient admission to reported death. Evolution of fatality cases over time can then be estimated from the model with reasonable accuracy. Data from South Korea, China, Australia, Germany, Italy and Spain were used to validate the model. Data from The United States, United Kingdom and Brazil were used to study the epidemiology as the pandemic progresses. Additionally, the 2WM was applied to world data and to the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. The model was implemented in MS-Excel, a popular and easy to use analytical tool. A template spreadsheet is provided as supplementary material. Constant lethality can be determined from the initial stage of the pandemic wave. Values ranged from 1.7% to 15.3%, depending on the degree of possible sub notification cases. Even for places with low testing, a linear relationship can be found. The two-wave model can be fine-tuned to properly adjust the data. The second wave pattern was estimated according to the first wave parameter. The accuracy for estimating COVID-19 evolution was compared to the classic SIR model with good agreement. According to the model, based on current trends, health protocols and policies, approximately 10,000,000 cases and 860,000 deaths will be recorded worldwide. Approximately 99% of that number would be reached by the end of July 2020 given constant conditions.",

COVID-19, the coronavirus disease promoted by SARS-CoV-2, can be compared with other disease outbreaks such as Ebola [6] and Influenza H1N1 [7] which infected and killed a great number of people worldwide, but it increases the pressure on particular demands of health systems around the world, due to ICU and respirators for longer times. Since the initial outbreak of COVID-19 efforts are being made to better understand the syndrome and its agent infectious pattern. The Center of Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University claims that the most important way to measure the burden of COVID-19 is mortality. Different fatality ratios have been reported throughout the countries worldwide, which is defined as the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases [8] . Differences in mortality have been attributed to the differences in the number of people tested, demographics, characteristics of the health care system, among others.",

When the epidemic is on course, as it is the case of SARS-CoV-2 disease outbreak in the first months of 2020, this formula can be inaccurate. On the other hand, there is urgent need to better understand the spread of the disease and its outcome and risks. Particularly, one wishes to mitigate the pandemic in order to buy precious time, so the health system is better prepared to deal with the incoming patients. Researchers are using different and complementary approaches such as reviewing techniques for disinfection of surfaces [3] , studying transmission factors and their dynamics [9] , looking for the origin of the virus [4] and developing alternative mathematical models to predict transmissibility and COVID-19 evolution [2] . Due to the easiness and the achievements of good results, mathematical models are being built to estimate the dynamic of the transmission of the virus [1, 4, 6] . However, some models require software only familiar to experts and many parameters are necessary to process and interpret the data. Sometimes those tools are not easily available and/or are not easily accessible for people directly involved with local data management and critical policy decision. Although there is a lack of good data sets, everywhere, mostly due to the small number of tests, the reported data are those which the leaders, health authorities and public agents have in order to support their decisions, trying to balance saving as many lives as they can, at the minimal economic and social costs.",

Therefore, the aim of this work is to contribute to data analysis and treatment providing a simple way to predict possible scenarios for pandemic evolution from a country down to a state or city using the well-known software MS-Excel, based on data with low accuracy but promoting satisfactory and, hopefully, useful results. Instead of using somehow more difficult to handle deterministic models based on a set of differential equations, we have chosen to use more intuitive statistical modeling tools. Statistical approach was also suggested in a recent published paper [9] ; in that case the author applied a hierarchical five-parameter logistic model and one wave, solved by a scripting code in R. The aim of this work is to contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic analysis as it progresses, offering a very simple but useful fitting model based on classical statistics, a combination of gaussian and gamma distributions, implemented in a MS-Excel spreadsheet. In addition, we provide a simple and easy to use MS-Excel (.xlsx) file and a brief tutorial so the interested user can use to easily follow SARS-CoV-2 epidemic progress.",

In all analyzed cases it was possible to obtain linear adjustment of the data by proper shifting (translation) of the time axis. Linearization procedure was applied to this pair of variables but testing different shifts. It was noticed that each country has its own particularities that this simple procedure can reveal. It was possible to find a lethality value (L) that is constant throughout each outbreak \"cycle\". However, for China, South Korea and Australia the procedure revealed two straight line segments. This does not mean that in practice the outbreak had two different lethality. It just shows that conditions may have changed for the disease dynamics or for the data registration protocol, possibly for both. Still, for mathematical modeling purposes, it will be considered that the outbreak may be adjusted as having two pseudo-lethality values, even for cases where those conditions have not changed. .

This table also shows the quantitative results of the linearization procedure, L and R 2 . Despite the differences on testing policies between countries, ranged from 1.4 to 27.8 tests per thousand inhabitants, all cases presented a high linearity behavior, high correlation coefficient, R 2 , as well as a low error on L values. This result indicates that even with low testing, the information on the number of cases can be linearly associated with the deaths that will be caused by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, even with underreporting of cases, if a country maintains a regular testing policy, it can use those results with as a reliable indicator to measure trends in the evolution of the pandemic. Of course, we know that the absolute values of the lethality may vary. For the countries we have considered, it goes from 1.7% (AUS) to 14.3% (ITA), with a world average of 8.4%. These figures require a more in-depth analysis of the particularities of each country. The problem of underreporting has been widely reported. A country with a high lethality value may indicate that it has a higher rate of unreported cases. Table I also shows the corresponding for each country. Germany has presented the highest value, needing = 12 days for the linear relationship between death and case numbers. This value match with the average time of 11.5 day from admission to death reported in the literature [13] . We speculate that, in the case of Germany a very systematic procedure between sampling, test result and communication are been conducting. So, the delay time for Germany is \u2248 0. Data from the USA also show typical dynamic delay response with = 8 days. If time from hospitalization to death in the USA is about 12 days, them \u2248 4 days. However, it is only possible to estimate an accurate average value of for a particular country or region if the mean admission to death time is known. Considering the information from the literature [13] as aleatory sampling, a confidence interval could be estimated for the average time from admission to death as 9 to 15 days. Figure 3 shows the graphs of new cases over time for the analyzed countries. The two-wave model fitted the cases satisfactorily. KOR is the only country where the observed data clearly shows a true second wave. In other countries, deconvolution by the two-wave model suggests the possible influence of a second wave, superposed on the previous one while was still progressing. KOR, CHI and AUS outbreaks apparently had a break and the two-wave model was sufficient to describe the cases so far. DEU, ESP and ITA outbreaks are still ongoing; the two-wave model can then describe data evolution for a near future. It is not possible to state that just two waves will be sufficient to describe all outbreaks around the world for the whole pandemic, but as mentioned before, one can easily add new wave cycles as necessary. Please notice that, in the case of CHN, the new cases announced on February 14th and 15th were not considered in the model. The strong discontinuity observed and reported in the literature [9] is a serious burden for any modeling attempted. ",

Table II shows the adjusted parameters found for the reference/chosen countries as well as the parameters for the two-wave model applied to other regions. Another possibility is to use the most expected value for each parameter directly. The standard deviation of the first wave is the key factor for a more accurate prediction, specially at the beginning of the outbreak. It is also important to compare \u0305 with other countries. Within the error margins it is possible to draw different scenarios and compare different countries/regions. The fitted values for \u0305 and for USA, GRB, BRA and SC state were within the limits estimated for the countries taken as reference. Table III gives first and second wave parameters as calculated from reference countries, i.e., countries chosen to validate the model. The average and range between lower and upper limits may be used to build possible scenarios for a target country or region. 3.3. Deaths Evolution, ( ) Figure 4 shows the case and death evolution over the time and deaths as a function of cases for the simulated linearized function. KOR and DEU were selected as representative cases. The combination of two-wave modeling for the cases evolution, lethality and hazard function could estimate the death with a good level of proximity. South Korea, as well as China and Australia, presented two values for lethality, according to the linearization procedure. Mathematically, this information was not incorporated into the model. However, before concluding that there are in fact two distinct lethality, it is necessary to analyze at least two important aspects: (1) if the duration of the outbreak is faster than the hospital stay until death and (2) if there was any significant change in testing policy or protocol and confirmed cases. The analysis of the data treated here allows to evaluate the first aspect. These countries were the ones that presented the shortest time for the first wave cycle. In the case of KOR the value was = 4.6 days, see Table II . This means that approximately 85% of people infected in the first wave were infected within 15 days. The average length of stay according to the literature varies from 2 to 56 days, with an average of 11.5 days and standard deviation of 10 days.

The model would be able to simulate this scenario, but in this case, it would be necessary to obtain accurate information on the distribution of the length of hospital stay until death in the countries considered. Table IV presents a critical parameter for adjusting the model, , that corresponds to the average delay time between hospitalization and confirmation of the case. The sum + represents approximately the average length of stay until death. If the length of hospital stay is different from that considered in the calculations, the difference may be subtracted from the value of . This adjustment is a position adjustment. If there are no significant variations in the testing protocols during the pandemic, this is a value that does not tend to change. The table also presents a comparison between the predictions obtained with the two-wave model, 2WM, and the SIR model. Differences in the forecast of the total number of cases fluctuated by approximately 20%. The dates predicted to end the outbreak in question also resulted in close values. The biggest discrepancy is related to the forecast for the end of the pandemic in the world. It is observed that the statistical model of two waves allows to obtain forecasts with results similar to those of the SIR, but with the advantages of simplicity and ease of implementation and analysis. .

            "text": "A two-wave statistical model, 2WM, based on the superposition of normal distributions was developed and used to fit current data and to estimate the evolution of infections and deaths in chosen reference countries and other ongoing places. The model showed good agreement even for apparent single wave behavior in some countries and can easily be extended to any number of waves. A gamma distribution was used to estimate death probability from patient admission at a health service to his/her reported death. Evolution of fatality cases over time is estimated from the model with reasonable accuracy. The model was successfully implemented in MS-Excel\u00ae, a popular and easy to use analytical tool. Constant lethality was determined from the initial stage of the pandemic wave. Values ranged from 1.7% to 15.3%, depending on the degree of possible sub notification cases. Even for places with low testing, a linear relationship could be found, by properly translating time series data. The two-wave model can be fine-tuned to properly adjust a variety of situations. A second wave pattern was estimated according to the first wave parameters. Confirmation of the future scenario, as predicted by the model, is vulnerable to changes in behavior on the part of the population and policies to deal with the epidemic. As a result, the characteristics of the second wave can extrapolate, for more or less, the observed and parameterized behavior. The accuracy for estimating COVID-19 evolution was compared to the classic SIR model, based on ordinary differential equations, with good agreement. According to our two-wave model and based on current trends, health protocols and policies, approximately 10,000,000 cases and 860,000 deaths will be recorded worldwide by the end of the pandemic. Approximately 99% of that number would be reached by the end of July 2020, given current conditions. In this way, the model offers complementary information to the classic models, hopefully contributing to the monitoring and management of the pandemic.",

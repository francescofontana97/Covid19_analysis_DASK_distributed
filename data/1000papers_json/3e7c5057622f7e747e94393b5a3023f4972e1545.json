To address the effectiveness of this five-drug regimen, we designed an observational cohort study (COrtiCoid-Aspirin-Anticoagulant-Colchicine-LAsix \u00ae , the COCAA-COLA study) including all successive non-critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring >1L/min-oxygen and admitted to our ward between 2020/01/09 and 2020/11/30 (during the second wave in France).",

The five drugs included in our regimen were given orally for a short course, paving the way for an outpatient treatment. Interestingly, the recent COLCORONA trial conducted in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients supported colchicine-related benefit in reducing hospitalizations, need for mechanical ventilation and mortality. 11 Colchicine dose regimen differed between the three studies with higher cumulative colchicine doses in the GRECCO-19 (22mg) and COLCORONA trials (16.5mg) compared to ours (8mg).

Multivariate analysis confirmed the significant effect of the five-drug regimen on outcome after adjustment for independent covariates, including age, body-mass index, 4C Mortality Score, high serum BNP level and high white blood cell count (OR=0.043 [0.0053-0.21], P=0.0005). The model was significant compared to a model without the five-drug regimen (P<0.00001). Additionally, patient subgroups were analyzed following stratification by age (using the median value as threshold), gender and risk factors including diabetes, elevated BNP (threshold, 100ng/ml) and troponin levels (threshold, 16ng/mL; Figure1). Remarkably, the five-drug regimen was associated with a significant reduction in primary composite endpoint in males only. Additionally, there was a stronger and more significant protective effect of our regimen in patients with elevated-BNP (OR=0.0 [0.0-0.47], P=0.007) than in low-BNP patients (OR=0.17 [0.02-0.94], P=0.03). Thus, the primary composite endpoint was improved in elevated-versus low-BNP patients (P=0.0003). We observed no remarkable adverse effects attributed to the five-drug regimen except mild colchicine-related diarrhea (21%) resolved with loperamide.

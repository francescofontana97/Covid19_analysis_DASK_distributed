The outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019-about a century after the Spanish flu of 1919, has since rapidly spread across the world resulting in infections, morbidity and mortality at scale unknown in recent times. The impact of the pandemic is evident in its evolution and how it is redefining global health emergencies. The pandemic has been described as one of the greatest challenges the world has had to face since World War II; and with the speed of spread and the very minimal preparedness for a pandemic of this magnitude, COVID-19 is uncharted territory. 1 As of 16 March 2021, over 120 million people had tested positive to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the outbreak; and deaths had exceeded 2.6 million globally. 2 Africa, despite being the last continent to be affected by the virus, has not experienced as much devastation as other continents. For example, West Africa, with a population of 367 million people, had confirmed 412 178 cases of COVID-19 with 5363 deaths as of 14 March 2021; compared with the USA which had recorded almost 30 million cases and 530 000 deaths, despite having a slightly smaller population (328 million).",

For example, several national governments across the world imposed border closures, movement restrictions and quarantine measures triggering fears of a looming economic recession. But despite the BMJ Global Health tendency for most countries to look primarily towards national interests in addressing the pandemic, there has been very significant global, bilateral and multilateral cooperation aimed at ending the pandemic. Africa, took steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic even before its first case was announced in Egypt on 14 February 2020. Many African countries, as well as regional institutions, acted promptly by mobilising resources to respond to the outbreak, drawing from experiences with managing previous epidemics. Institutions and mechanisms had been established as part of pan-African, subregional and country-specific epidemic preparedness strategies. 3 For example, the Africa Centre for Disease Control activated its emergency operations centre for COVID-19 on 27 January 2020 to coordinate efforts at various levels, including regional structures such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), as well as the agencies of the various national governments. 3 This may partly explain why Africa has not experienced similar infection rates and fatalities compared with some other parts of the world. In this article, we describe how financial resources were mobilised and allocated to curtail the pandemic in West Africa at regional level. Data were collated as part of the operational activities in the West African Health Organization (WAHO), an agency of the ECOWAS, as sourced from the various countries in the region and partners, as well as the Devex repository (an online platform for the global development community). 4",

These commodities include PPE and diagnostic laboratory equipment, ventilators, body temperature scanners, among other materials. Table 1 provides a snapshot of the support provided by some organisations as well as the thematic area in which support was invested. This list, based on the response on questionnaires received from the organisations contacted as well as on information gathered from desk review, is not exhaustive of the support received in the region. Further, as of 11 March 2021, seven countries in the region (Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d' Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Sierra Leone and Gambia) have received a total of 5 476 000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccines from the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access intervention. 10 OUTCOMES, LESSONS LEARNT AND WAY FORWARD Just as during the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak, West African countries continue to build resilience and responsiveness into the health systems. Even though the pandemic continues to rage on, and there are fears of a second wave, West Africa's early response strategies may be paying off in many ways already. For example, whereas the region had only two laboratories for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at the outset of the pandemic in January, by September 2020, all countries had established several equipped laboratories and the total for the region was 236. Rapid test kits are now being developed in countries like Senegal and Nigeria, in addition to the optimisation of GeneXpert for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in addition to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis for which the technology was initially developed. 11 Coordination mechanisms have also improved across the region. Human and infrastructural capacity for epidemic response had been put in place during the Ebola crisis as well as for the surveillance and control of other diseases such as Lassa fever and poliomyelitis.

Contacttracing approaches rapidly evolved using this infrastructure, as knowledge and experience with the novel contagion increased. Although research capacity is still lagging compared with more advanced economies, response to the pandemic has resulted in rapid advancement in research in West Africa. For example, Nigeria was the first African country to publish the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, contributing to early knowledge about the nature of the virus. 13 Operational research capacity has also been enhanced as evidence from the field has to a great extent informed decision-making in health and other sectors in relation to the pandemic response. Whereas routine data systems were initially affected at the onset of the pandemic, in some countries these systems rapidly evolved and adapted, thus contributing to evidence generation for response strategies as well as building overall health systems resilience. 14 Agile software has also been employed for the development of iterative electronic data management tools to support real-time evidence-informed decision-making, in response to the rapidly evolving pandemic situation. 14 Despite the above, there are still significant gaps in the response in West Africa. While health systems are not yet overwhelmed compared with many other countries around the globe, an unexpected turn in the spread may rapidly turn the tide negatively. 15 There is need, therefore, to intensify ongoing efforts. More support for regional and country-level coordination mechanisms is needed. Efforts need to be invested in further adapting health information management systems to readily provide reliable evidence despite the systemic shock occasioned by the pandemic. Testing capacity is still lagging in many ECOWAS countries, so also are health commodities and infrastructure. Investment in these as well as the human resource capacity to manage and operate them will go a long way to meet the existing need, while also preparing the region for any sudden change in the progression of the pandemic, such as a second wave which is already being experienced in some countries around the world. 16 Medium to longer term strategies would include investment in revitalisation of research and development in health technologies, such as local vaccine production capacity. This would shield the region from overdependence on the global community to meet local needs.",

The mean weekly birthrate is estimated by 10\u03bc = 1/(5 \u00d7 52). The variation in monthly birth rate is shown in Table 1 . Finally, for each model we 11 assume a negative binomial observation process with mean equal to the number of weekly reported 12 cases and dispersion parameter \u03bd. 13 We describe in detail the dynamics of each of the five models outlined in Figure 1 . Model A [13, 2] 14 is an SIRS model in which severe and mild rotavirus are tracked separately. Severe infections have a (M. Ferrari) = 0.24\u03bb i . Individuals leave 44 the infected with severe rotavirus for a mean period of one week (\u03b3 (s) = 1) following which they 45 are considered to be recovered. Similarly, (4) tracks the total infections with mild rotavirus, with 46 \u03bb (m) i = 0.76\u03bb i and a mean infectious period of just half a week (\u03b3 (m) = 2). 47 Recently [7] estimated that 3 doses of vaccine had 66.7% efficacy against severe RVGE among 175 children in Niger. Though we do not explicitly account for 3 doses of vaccine, we can calculate the 176 effective seroconversion rate for our model above that would yield this observed efficacy after a com-177 plete sequence of doses. Thus, we set \u03b7 (s) = .667 and use (5) to calculate the effective seroconversion 178 rate as 49%. Then the vaccine efficacy for all RVGE is \u03b7 (m) = .515. We estimate the predicted impact 179 of vaccination using different \u03b7 (s) , \u03b7 (m) and \u03c3 values with the same dynamic equations. 180 Although we used the two dose strategy, by using different value of the efficacy, our study can 181 account for uncertainty in the seroconversion rate. Figures 2-4 are matched to Figures 3-5 in the 182 main paper. Because of the lower seroconversion rate, the projected results were qualitatively similar, 183 quantitatively smaller.

Therefore, 140 an additional vaccinated state V i is added to the model for age group i. Two additional input parameters are required for the vaccine efficacy against severe and mild RVGE. We assume the 142 vaccination happens at 2 months, but the vaccine efficacy is equal to the efficacy predicted under 143 models B-E for the two dose strategy, \u03b7 (s) = .796 and \u03b7 (m) = .609.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF14": {"text": "Given our vaccination strategy for models B-E, the vaccine efficacy for severe RVGE after two 145 doses is 79.6%, in line with efficacy studies of rotavirus vaccines.

Then, the dynamics are modified to allow for transitions between 154 compartments by vaccination.155 When the vaccine is introduced in the population it leads to decreased transmission, which in turn 157 leads to a reduced force of infection. The direct effect (DE) of vaccination is the expected reduction 158 in cases for vaccinated individuals that is not due to the reduction in force of infection. On the other 159 hand, the indirect effect (IE) of vaccination is the expected reduction in cases for both vaccinated 160 and unvaccinated individuals due to the reduction in force of infection. The total effect (TE) of 161 vaccination includes both DE and IE. 162 Define S * to be the updated number of susceptibles after the vaccine has been introduced. Our 163 models assume successive infections except for model A which has 0 weight.

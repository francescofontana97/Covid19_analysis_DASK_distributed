The present study investigated the angiogenic and apoptotic activity of the BMECs in glucocorticoid-induced ONFH. Methods: This study enrolled a total of 12 patients, six of whom were assigned to the ONFH group whereas the other six served as the control group. The ONFH group was composed of patients with glucocorticoid-induced ONFH while the control group had femoral neck fractures. BMECs were isolated from the subchondral region of the femoral head. Cell proliferation, cell viability, tube formation assay, Transwell assay, TUNEL assay, and Western blot analysis were performed.",

The dysfunction of BMECs has been reported to cause femoral head microcirculation obstacle, which is key to the development of glucocorticoid-induced ONFH [10] . Yu et al. [19] reported that glucocorticoids profoundly affect the transcriptome of BMECs during the early stages of glucocorticoid-induced ONFH. According to Yue et al. [18] , glucocorticoids can induce BMECs to express various cytokines, which contributes to the development of glucocorticoid-induced ONFH. In the present investigation, we isolated BMECs from the subchondral region of the femoral head in the two groups.

These results indicated that these cells in the two groups were BMECs. Then, we used tube formation and migration assays to examine angiogenesis. The findings of this study indicate that the angiogenic activity of BMECs was profoundly impaired in the ONFH group in comparison with the control group. The reduced angiogenic activity of BMECs in ONFH patients may reflect the dysfunction of BMECs. It has proved that the dysfuntion of BMECs can impair vascular repair, blood vessel growth and finally decrease the local blood flow of the femoral head, which has been considered to be the cause of the glucocorticoid-induced ONFH [11] . Therefore, the reduced angiogenic activity of BMECs is thus a potential mechanism for glucocorticoid-induced ONFH.",

Not only osteoblasts but also BMECs participate in the apoptosis process during the progression of ONFH. Kerachian et al. [25] pointed out that apoptosis of BMECs could activate the thrombosis cascade, followed by ischemia and infarction during the development of the glucocorticoid-induced ONFH. Also, Vogt et al. [26] showed that glucocorticoids could reduce angiogenesis by inducing the apoptosis of endothelial cells, and therefore injuring BMECs. Consistent with these studies, the TUNEL-positive cells in our study were only recorded in the ONFH group, suggesting that glucocorticoids induced apoptosis of BMECs in ONFH patients. It is known that caspase cascade plays an essential role in apoptosis and caspase-3 is activated during apoptosis [27] . Overexpression of caspase-3 has previously reported in ONFH patients [28] . Disruption of mitochondrial functions due to oxidative stress factors stimulates the caspase pathway, triggering apoptosis [29] . Also, the stimulation of cells by apoptotic factors facilitates dissociation of the original Bax and Bcl-2, causing an increase in Bax and decrease in Bcl-2 [30] . In this study, we demonstrated that Bcl-2 was markedly suppressed, while Bax and cleaved caspase 3 were increased in the ONFH group. These changes in expression levels suggest that the mitochondria participate in the apoptosis of BMECs in ONFH patients.",

Firstly, the study was done in vitro and cannot, therefore, be replicated in the local environment of the femoral head, in the setting of glucocorticoidinduced ONFH. Consequently, the dysfunction of BMECs reported in this study may not hold for other etiologies of glucocorticoid-induced ONFH. Secondly, the sample size of our study was small and cannot, therefore, account for all patient comorbidities.",

The decreased angiogenic and increased apoptotic activities may be responsible for the pathogenesis and progression of glucocorticoid-induced ONFH. Therefore, protecting the function of BMECs, such as promoting angiogenic or inhibiting apoptosis of BMECs, could offer an efficient therapeutic target for glucocorticoid-induced ONFH, which needs further exploration.",

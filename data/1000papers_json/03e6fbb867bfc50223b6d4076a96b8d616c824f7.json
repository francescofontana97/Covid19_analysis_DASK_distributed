In particular, in a single room with an asymptomatic patient, four sites, including the bedrail, pillow, bedsheet, and air exhaust outlet, were SARS-CoV-2 positive. This highlights that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients can contaminate their surroundings and therefore that persons who have direct contact with them such as their family members and health care workers can be exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Isolation of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients at home imposes risks to their family members. Shelter hospitals may be a better option (6) . The findings also highlight that the importance of environment cleaning should be emphasized. The remarkably wide-ranging SARS-CoV-2-positive rates for individual rooms may also reflect differing levels of stringency with respect to room cleaning and disinfection. All of the six rooms were maintained under negative-pressure conditions, which may have provided a false feeling of safety and may have led to laxity with respect to essential measures such as environment cleaning. Such a false feeling of safety is potentially harmful and should therefore be avoided. We are aware of limitations in this study. Although we collected 1,500 liters of air for each air sample, that amount represents a low volume compared to the whole space of the room. We tested only for viral nucleic acid and did not perform viral culture to test viability.

            "text": "On an average night, it is estimated more than 400,000 people living within the European Union, and more than 600,000 people living in America are homeless. 1 Within Great Britain the number of people experiencing homelessness has been rising since 2010. 2 Recent research demonstrated that within this population there are extremely high rates of multi-morbidity, frailty and age-related conditions at a young age. 3 These factors contribute to the young average age of death for people experiencing homelessness. [4] [5] [6] Palliative care involvement from specialists or other health care professionals for this population is rare for a number of reasons, including complexities in identifying who may benefit from palliative care, a lack of appropriate places of care for people with high care and support needs, mental health difficulties and/or addiction issues and the recovery focused nature of many homelessness services. 7, 8 Therefore in addition to often occurring at a young age, the deaths of many people experiencing homelessness frequently follow crisis-led hospital admissions. 9 This lack of palliative care support and appropriate places of care means that burdens associated with supporting very unwell homeless people with complex problems, often fall on hostel staff; adequate support from health and social care providers is often lacking. 7, 9 Previous research highlighted a need for a more multidisciplinary approach when supporting people who are homeless and have complex and palliative care needs. 7 In order to help hostel staff support residents with complex ill health, a 2-day educational training course on palliative care for hostel staff was developed and evaluated. 10 The training increased the knowledge of hostel staff regarding how to access palliative care for residents and the awareness of signs of deteriorating health. However, due to high hostel staff turnover and lack of formal connection with outside agencies, it was concluded that for training to have a sustainable impact, it needs to be incorporated into regular support. This regular support could be driven by palliative care specialists. A palliative care approach is holistic, recognises that not everyone will recover, focuses on what 'living well' means to someone and can incorporate parallel planning (i.e. hoping for best, whilst planning for the worst). This is currently lacking within the recovery-focused homelessness services.",

In one of the hostels, the champions were called in to help before they were scheduled to begin, due to a crisis with a resident. Though less planned, this resulted in the champions quickly gaining trust and a successful partnership through demonstrating the support they could bring to the staff and the residents.

This included proactively contacting the relevant services, chasing up referrals and feeling confident that they knew the needs of the residents and when services should be involved: In the hostel that had GP in-reach already, the relationship between the GP and hostel staff improved greatly to now communicating and working together to provide residents with the best care possible.: The champions felt that with more time they would be able to achieve much more including being more proactive so that all residents could have care plans and access increased support: The hostel staff were also challenged by a lack of time and unpredictability in their work. To address this the champions needed to be flexible. Occasionally they would arrive at the hostel and staff or residents were not able to meet with them. To deal with this, they needed backup plans of things they could do if residents or staff are unavailable, such as reading through policy documents or seeing another resident. Primary care barriers. Some hostels were well supported by GPs providing regular in-reach clinics. However, in one hostel in particular, the champions described feeling shocked by the response of some of the GPs who demonstrated a lack of compassion and understanding for the population and their needs. Champions and hostel staff struggled to get referrals to palliative or mental health services and adequate support for residents who were unwell. This made the role of the champion even more important, but also more challenging. ",

Previous research has highlighted the barriers people experiencing homelessness face accessing healthcare 17 and our research highlights an urgent need for more equitable access to high quality primary care. In the two hostels that did not have an in-reach GP or nurse or close links to primary care, the unmet needs of the hostel staff and residents was greater, and champions filled gaps that should have been provided by primary care. Work is ongoing to reduce health and social care barriers, such as by the charity Groundswell 18 who developed a pocket-sized laminated card explaining people's rights to access primary health care and peer support for GP registration and appointments. However, more training and support or dedicated funded inclusion health primary care provision in this area is still needed. Another challenge for the champions was the lack of time they had at the hostel. This project has shown how much can be achieved with as little as two half-days a month per champion but going forward a funded role would allow for more time to be dedicated towards people experiencing homelessness.",

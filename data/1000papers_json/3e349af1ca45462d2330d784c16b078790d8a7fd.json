            "text": "We revisit the population of normal pulsars in the Galactic field in an 'evolutionary' approach. By comparing the distributions of various parameters of synthetic pulsars detectable by the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey, the Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array Survey, and two Swinburne Multibeam surveys with those of the real pulsars detected by the same surveys, we find that a good and physically realistic model can be obtained by using a uniform distribution of the braking index in the range of 2.5 to 3.0, a uniform distribution of the cosine of the angle between the spin and the magnetic axis in the range of 0 to 1, a log-normal birth distribution of the surface dipolar magnetic field with the mean and the standard deviation as 12.85 and 0.55 respectively while keeping the distributions of other parameters unchanged from the ones most commonly used in the literature. We have also replaced the universal 'death-line' by a 'death-condition' specific to each individual pulsar. We find that our model is better than the most popular model. With our improved model, we predict that an all-sky pulsar survey with phase-I SKA-MID will detect about nine thousand normal pulsars in the Galactic field. Among these pulsars, a considerable number will produce continuous gravitational waves in the operational range of the future ground-based gravitational waves detectors like LIGO A+, and in certain cases, the spin-down limit of the gravitational wave strains will be well below the detection sensitivity limit. We also provide a fit for the present-day distributions of the spin periods and 1400 MHz luminosities of the whole normal pulsar population in the Galactic field (which are potentially observable) and those can be used in future population studies under the snapshot approach.",

            "text": "Ever since the first discovery in 1967 (Hewish et al. 1968 ), more than 2500 pulsars have been discovered with a variety of observational characteristics and intrinsic properties. Understanding the birth, evolution, life, and death of pulsars has been of great interest consequently. However, the greatest challenge towards such studies has been the issue of selection biases due to limitations of telescopes and searching algorithms, higher selectivity towards brighter nearby objects, dispersion and scattering of the radio waves in the interstellar medium, etc., in the case of the properties of the observed pulsar samples. Thus, what we observe today is believed to represent only a minuscule portion of a much larger underlying population of pulsars. This strongly motivates the need of statistical studies of pulsar populations. There are two approaches for pulsar population studies. The first is the 'snapshot' approach where people perform statistical studies on the observed parameters of the known pulsars and use that knowledge to synthesize an entire pulsar population, at that current epoch, which is then further optimized to match to the observed sample as much as possible. The second one is the 'evolutionary' approach where one simulates the distribution of parameters \u22c6 E-mail: anirban.chakraborty096@gmail.com \u2020 E-mail: manjari@imsc.res.in of the newly born pulsars and then model their spin and kinematic evolution, as well as the selection effects, and compare the final distributions of parameters of these synthetic pulsars to the observed sample.",

We use the definition of non-recycled normal pulsars as those having the value of the spin period larger than 0.03 seconds. The last extensive effort to understand various parameters of this population was done in 2006 by whose results were later supported by Ridley & Lorimer (2010) , Bates et al. (2014) , and many others. This paper is organised as follows, Section 2 describes our methodology (including a description of the surveys we use and the comparison strategies adopted) and our analysis results, leading to an improved set of population parameters. We also present the underlying distribution functions for various parameters of the potentially observable pulsar population at the present epoch. We outline results for the normal pulsar population observable by future pulsar surveys like the Square Kilometer Array and discuss the prospects of detection of continuous gravitational waves in various subsections of Section 3. Our main conclusions are summarized in Section 4.",

Then, we need to model the motion of the pulsars in the Galaxy to get their final locations, their spin evolution to obtain the present-day spin parameters, as well as model their luminosities. Afterward, to test the validity of these models, we need to compare the properties of the simulated pulsars to those of the observed sample that is affected by observational limitations. Therefore, we further need to pass our synthetic pulsars through the conditions of such limitations as well. For this, we first require to convert pulsar luminosities to flux values at the telescopes using their simulated distances. Then, we need to model the effect of the interstellar medium on the detectability, e.g., scattering and dispersion of the radio waves. For this purpose, we use NE2001 model of the Galactic electron density (Cordes & Lazio 2002) . Finally, we need to model the telescope sensitivities using the radiometer equation (Lorimer & Kramer 2012) .",

(2014) provided an excellent package 'PsrPopPy' 1 that can perform evolutionary population synthesis using its module called 'evolve'. In addition to the models for various parameters chosen by , the 'evolve' module has options to use some other models too. In the present work, we use the 'evolve' module, but modify it whenever necessary to accommodate our investigations. We also utilise the 'dosurvey' module of PsrPopPy to model the detectability of simulated pulsars in various surveys (will be discussed later).

However, in the case of some parameters, there are options to choose distributions different from the default ones. Like 'evolve', 'populate' can also be used with 'dosurvey' to find out how many of the present population of pulsars would be detectable by various surveys and the properties of such detectable population. Due to the ease of use, 'populate' interface in PsrPopPy is widely used to understand the performance of various surveys (Keane et al. 2015; McEwen et al. 2020; Bhattacharyya et al. 2016; Keith et al. 2010) .

So, it is reasonable to expect that the deviation from the orthogonal rotator model should be accompanied by a change in the birth distribution of B. Keeping the distribution type log-normal (in the logarithm to the base 10), we vary the values of \u00b5 logB and \u03c3 logB over a wide range to see whether we can obtain a better agreement between the parameters of the simulated and the real pulsars.

Such extra-Galactic and transient events are, however, not the only potential sources of observable gravitational waves. One local source of gravitational waves that would provide a continuous signal is a rapidly rotating neutron star. Spinning neutron stars (isolated as well as those in binary systems) could generate detectable gravitational waves via several possible mechanisms. We consider the simplest and the most optimistic scenario for the case of an isolated neutron star, which we consider as a rigid star (with a triaxial moment of inertia ellipsoid) rotating around its principal axis of inertia and emitting gravitational waves from the l = m = 2 (spherical harmonics) mass quadrupole mode. In this case, the gravitational wave frequency f gw is expected to be twice the rotational spin frequency f rot (= P \u22121 ) of the pulsar.",

Since \u03b7 < 1, it implies that h 0 < h sd 0 . Therefore, it is reasonable to expect the detection of continuous gravitational waves only when the detection sensitivity reaches well below h sd 0 . Even if there is a non-detection of continuous gravitational waves when our detector's sensitivity has beaten the spin-down limit h sd 0 of some particular pulsars, it will allow us to constrain the fraction of spin-down energy that can be attributed to the emission of gravitational-waves and we can also place stringent limits on the equatorial fiducial ellipticity of the star, which will be ultimately helpful for studies of the equation of state of the neutron star matter. So far, there are 20 young pulsars (Abbott et al. 2019) for which the sensitivity of the LIGO search runs have been able to beat their respective spin-down limits, but no detection of continuous gravitational waves have been claimed yet. We expect that future pulsar surveys and their precision timing campaigns will discover more pulsars with f gw in the range of ground based gravitational waves detectors as well as large enough values of h sd 0 , that are well inside the instrument sensitivity limits. Table 5 . For the synthetic pulsar set, the number of pulsars in each bin is the average over 50 realizations of Model-D. The filled turquoise-blue histograms depict the corresponding distributions for the whole sample of normal real pulsars in the Galatic field (around 2300 pulsars) that have been detected so far using any terrestial telescope. Using a single realisation of Model-D, we extract the set of the synthetic pulsars that the proposed SKA-MID all-sky survey (Table  5 ) would be able to detect. For each such SKA-detectable pulsar, assuming the canonical value of the moment of inertia (i.e. I 45 = 1), we calculate their respective spin-down limits using equation (6) and check whether we will be in a position to detect continuous gravitational waves from them using more sensitive future LIGO observing science runs (LIGO A+).",

By comparing the distributions of various parameters of synthetic pulsars detectable by the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey, the Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array Survey, and two Swinburne Multibeam surveys with those of the real pulsars detected by the same surveys, we find that a good and physically realistic model can be obtained by using a uniform distribution of the braking index in the range of 2.5 to 3.0, a uniform distribution of the cosine of the angle between the spin and the magnetic axis in the range of 0 to 1, a log-normal birth distribution of the surface dipolar magnetic field (in Gauss) with the mean and the standard deviation as 12.85 and 0.55 respectively while keeping the distributions of other parameters unchanged from the population model (Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re & Kaspi 2006) most commonly used in the literature. We have replaced the universal 'death-line' by a 'death-condition' specific to each individual pulsar, depending on its braking index and inclination angle. With our best model, which we call as model-D, we predict that a prospective pulsar survey with phase-I SKA-MID will detect about nine thousand normal pulsars in the Galactic field. A good number of pulsars among these set will produce continuous gravitational waves in the operational range of the future ground-based gravitational waves detectors like LIGO A+, and about fifty of them will be promising candidates for the detection of continuous gravitational waves. We also provide a fit for the present-day distributions of the spin period and 1400 MHz luminosity of the whole normal pulsar population in the Galactic field, which are radio loud and beaming towards the earth, i.e. potentially observable with a sensitive enough telescope. From our analy- sis, we conclude that the underlying L 1400 distribution is well fit by a log-normal function (in the logarithm to the base 10) with mean \u00b5 logL = \u22121.219 (L = 0.06 mJy kpc 2 ) and standard deviation \u03c3 logL = 0.93. The spin period distribution (in units of milliseconds) is also adequately described by a log-normal distribution (in the logarithm to the base 10) with \u00b5 logP = 3.07 and \u03c3 logP = 0.35. These distribution functions can be readily used in future population studies under the snapshot approach.",

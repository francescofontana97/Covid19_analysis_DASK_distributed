The combination between local analyses and a public repository of allelic data strikes a balance between potential confidentiality issues and the need to compare results. The possibility of deploying private instances of chewie-NS facilitates the creation of nomenclature servers with a restricted user base to allow compliance with the strictest data policies. Chewie-NS allows users to easily share their own schemas and to explore publicly available schemas, including informative statistics on schemas and loci presented in interactive charts and tables. Users can retrieve all the information necessary to run a schema locally or all the alleles identified at a particular locus. The integration with the chewBBACA suite enables users to directly upload new schemas to chewie-NS, download existing schemas and synchronize local and remote schemas from chewBBACA command line version, allowing an easier integration into highthroughput analysis pipelines. The same REST API linking chewie-NS and the chewBBACA suite supports the interaction of other interfaces or pipelines with the databases available at chewie-NS, facilitating the reusability of the stored data.",

The advent and widespread adoption of highthroughput sequencing allowed leveraging genomic information for this purpose (1, 2) . One of the most common approaches in bacterial typing is gene-by-gene methods, which extend the concept of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to include all genes present in the core genome of a given species (cgMLST) or, trying to cover a significant fraction of a species' pan-genome, in whole genome (wgMLST) (3) . Current software approaches implementing these wg/cgMLST typing methods suffer from standardization issues when comparing results between different tools and between different laboratories or users (4) .",

Chewie-NS aims to complement the private local analysis of strains by also allowing the simple communication of results while providing an interface for users to easily explore the allelic diversity within species. The importance of the latter is becoming increasingly clear with the recognition that bacterial phenotypes can be profoundly altered by allelic variants (12,13). Other publicly available web services require submission of raw data, something that may raise privacy and ownership concerns, while our approach of enabling local analyses is more flexible and scalable, and respects data privacy concerns. Current wg/cgMLST typing methods suffer from standardization difficulties or issues that manifest not only when trying to reconcile results from different tools, but also when the same tool is run at different times with small adjustments in parameter values or database modifications that may lead to inconsistencies. This is an even more complex problem than it was for classical MLST methods (14) . Having a repository of schemas, their associated parameters and the allelic diversity identified will allow the consistent use of gene-by-gene typing schemas by different groups and to build upon the results of different studies to monitor microbial populations and study outbreaks.",

Requests and HTTPS connections are handled by a web server, NGINX (v. 1.17) (https://www. nginx.com/), that communicates with Gunicorn (v. 20.0.4) (https://gunicorn.org/), a WSGI application server capable of running multiple processes of the web application and distributing incoming requests to ensure scalability and load balancing. A queueing system was implemented to manage all tasks with possible concurrent user access through Redis (v. 5.0.6) (https://redis.io/) and Celery (v. 4.4.0rc2) (https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/ getting-started/introduction.html).",

In all charts, the user can zoom in on particular regions for more detailed inspection and, on the latter two, clicking on the chart element opens a page with more information on that particular locus. Below the charts is a table of all the loci in the schema, including relevant information for each locus. This table, as all other tables of chewie-NS, is searchable, facilitating finding loci with particular characteristics (Figure 4 ). Similarly to other tables, the table can also be exported in comma-separated values format.",

The possibility of schema creators offering their own annotation allows for domain-specific information to be added to the schema, including potentially richer complementary data and links to relevant external resources. Two charts are offered, one summarizing the size distribution of the alleles (frequency of binned sizes) and the other representing the sizes of each allele. Direct links to perform BLAST searches using allele 1 of that locus (BLASTn and BLASTx) are available at the bottom of the page, allowing the user to check for similarities that could offer further insights into the origin or likely function of the protein potentially encoded by the locus. A multi-fasta file containing the alleles of the locus can be downloaded by the users from this page.

By taking advantage of chewie-NS's API, chewBBACA is capable of handling not only the schema creation, but also its upload, synchronization and download. Users of chewB-BACA registered in chewie-NS and with contributor privileges will be able to automatically upload a novel schema, making it available in chewie-NS. Any authorized registered user can also contribute novel alleles identified in local analyses to chewie-NS, contributing to the incremental development of the schema. This involves only allele information without the need to share a complete allelic profile with chewie-NS. On the other hand, one does not have to be registered to download any of the data stored in chewie-NS, including the compressed schemas or the novel alleles submitted to the chewie-NS database and that were not present on the compressed file to update the local schema.

Anyone can use the API to download any of the schemas deposited in chewie-NS to be run locally with chewBBACA or any other allele-calling algorithm.

The detailed parameterization associated with each schema created with chewBBACA and the consistency checks implemented in chewie-NS mean that no human curation is necessary after the schema creation step, contributing to the rapid update of the database and exchange of information. However, although chewie-NS can be used to store and retrieve information of schemas not created with chewBBACA, it does not currently automatically guarantee the consistency of newly submitted alleles since each allele-calling algorithm will have specific parametrization requirements. Nevertheless, these can be implemented in the future as other allele-calling algorithms make use of the chewie-NS platform.",

            "text": "Chewie-NS accomplishes four important goals. First, it stores all the information required to define a chewBBACA schema, facilitating accessibility of schemas so that different schemas can be easily compared and evaluated. Second, it maintains a public compendium of the variability in each locus. Since chewBBACA loci are open-reading frames D664 Nucleic Acids Research, 2021, Vol. 49, Database issue (ORFs), this will allow monitoring the variability of the proteins potentially encoded by these loci. This is important when studying microbial pathogens because small variations in sequence can lead to dramatic changes in virulence (16) or antimicrobial resistance (12). On the other hand, allelic diversity can also be indicative of stabilizing or diversifying selective pressures, which in turn can be leveraged to obtain insights into pathogen evolution or interaction with the host (17) . Allelic diversity is also important in reverse vaccinology (18) and to monitor the continued potential efficacy of some available vaccines (19) . Third, through its integration with chewBBACA, it offers a simplified way for the user to control the flow of information between the local instance and chewie-NS. This is important to keep the local instance of chewBBACA updated with the current common nomenclature stored in chewie-NS databases and to contribute new alleles to the common databases, but it also allows for limited sharing of data to comply with any regulations the user may be operating under. Finally, the proposed workflow hopes to stimulate and facilitate data sharing between users using the same schemas, allowing for a faster detection of strain similarity, therefore contributing for genomic epidemiology studies and also faster outbreak detection and investigation by expediting strain comparison between different laboratories or institutions. Although the current integration of chewBBACA with chewie-NS facilitates the user interaction with chewie-NS when using this allele-calling software, the API can be exploited by other allele-calling software to also interact directly with chewie-NS, allowing an easier submission of schemas and of new alleles to schemas not created with chewBBACA.",

If one uses the same set of target loci defined in the same way, but a different allele-calling software, one cannot guarantee that the alleles called for a given isolate would be the same as with another allele-calling software, a problem that can potentially become all the more acute with the identification of novel alleles. Even when using the same allele-calling software, if the parameters used are different, the alleles identified in a given isolate may also be different. Moreover, the addition of novel alleles to a schema that do not conform with the parameters defined initially may have hard to anticipate consequences on the subsequent allele-calling processes. Upstream of this, we would like to stress the importance of the use of shared assembly pipelines, to ensure that the deposited allele sequences are determined based on standardized procedures, as it has been shown that different assemblers can result in different variants in the assembly (21) and that this variability can introduce artificial allelic variability, even when using the same schema and allelecalling software.",

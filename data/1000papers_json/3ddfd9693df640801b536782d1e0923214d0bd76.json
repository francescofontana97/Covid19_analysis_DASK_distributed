We used two 432 complementary approaches that highlight different key aspects of disease clustering. Space-433 time scan statistics detect the geographical location of case clusters, assess their significance, 434 and characterize their relative risk and duration. This prospective approach is particularly 435 appropriate for the establishment of a daily surveillance system, since it identifies 'alive' 436 clusters only, i.e. having an excess of relative risk on the day of analysis (48). Unlike other 437 detection methods, this approach search for clusters without imposing the specification of their 438 size and allow for analysis of area with heterogeneous population densities. Indeed it identifies 439 a cluster if risk of disease within a space-time cylinder (radius = space, and height = time) is 440 higher than outside. This type of information is key for public health authorities to target 441 neighborhoods and calibrate protective or preventive measures to be deployed. 442As for the MST-DBSCAN algorithm, it characterizes the diffusion dynamic of the transmission 443 clusters.

The space-time (SaTScan) 447 and the diffusion-type (MST-DBSCAN) analyses thus provide complementary results in terms 448 of clusters emergence, duration, and demographic characteristics. The two approaches used 449 in conjunction, allow thus for detailed monitoring of the disease's epidemic trajectory and 450 populations at risk and offer adequate tools for governments to both prioritize interventions on 451 excess-risk locations and develop adapted strategies to control cluster diffusion types. 452 453 Maps reflect the chronology of the epidemic 454 The results displayed on static and animated maps well reflect the chronology of the sanitary 455 situation during the first wave of the epidemics. For instance, the major clusters in the Joux 456 valley area can be clearly observed on different maps (Figures 6B, 6B', 6C, 6C'). Noteworthy, 457 these large clusters originate from a super-spreader event that took place end of February in 458 a religious ceremony in Mulhouse, France. Many swiss residents participated in this ceremony 459 and additional related clusters were also observed during the same period north of the 460 Lausanne urban area, and along the Jura mountains (e.g. Morges and Nyon). Conversely, 461 Lausanne was early hit by clusters likely due to a first transmission event that occurred in 462 Northern Italy. 463 Interestingly, the initial phase observed in the state of Vaud differ from what happened in 464 Geneva, where the first clusters emerged in deprived neighborhoods eight days (March 5) after 465 the first positive case (February 26) was detected (22, 8). In Vaud instead, the initial cluster 466 was directly detected the day of the first cases (March 4), with 9 positives and in a wealthy 467 neighborhood. 468 469 Positive impact of soft lockdown 470The soft lockdown was directly associated with a rapid reduction in the number of positive 471 cases and this despite the increased rate of testing.

Similarly, the largest clusters, the longest duration and the clusters with individuals 477 showing large viral loads were observed just after the same time-lag. This time lag seems 478 shorter in urban areas as compared to rural areas, likely reflecting the faster spread of the 479 virus in large town such as Lausanne, Morges, Nyon, Yverdon and on the Vaud Riviera. This 480 faster spread is likely due to differences in social and cultural organization between rural and 481 urban areas, to less available room per person in housings, with higher risk of subsequent 482 infection in family with lower socio-economic situations. 483 Our results highlight the efficacy of the lockdown strategy, even soft, to control the epidemic 484 and to decrease the number of positive cases. It also demonstrates the importance of acting 485 when the number of positive cases increases and not waiting for the settlement of clusters. 486 Besides, our results show that the relative risk stayed very low within all the lockdown period. 487 Of note, the compliance of Swiss residents during the first soft lockdown is signaled by the 488 absence of any significant cluster from May 3 to June 16.

Interestingly three out of the four clusters 768shown are located in wealthy areas. March 15 ( Figures 6B and 6B') is the day before the soft-769lockdown. There is a multitude of clusters in the Lausanne area, among which a large fraction 770 is significant ( Figure 6B ). Figure 6B ' shows that these clusters rapidly merged into a single 771 \"super cluster\" deployed over the urban agglomeration. In the country-side, active clusters 772 emerge and grow north of the lake in the Joux valley located in the Jura mountains where 773 population density is low. Four days later, March 19 ( Figures 6C and 6C') , the peak of the first 774 wave is approaching (see Figure 1B ). The number of case clusters is high in the Lausanne 775 area ( Figure 6C ) but clearly stabilizes. Similar behavior is observed towards east, along 776 Geneva lake; in the Riviera area only one moving cluster is observed ( Figure 6C Figure 1B ). New cases reactivate moving 780 clusters in the center of Lausanne, while towards west the situation stabilizes and even 781 reduces toward Geneva with no more significant cluster in the Nyon area. At the peak, a large 782 significant cluster remains steady in the Jura, and several clusters grow in the remote, rural 783 periphery north of the main urban area ( Figures 6D and 6D' ). In the north, close to the Lake of 784Neuch\u00e2tel, the clusters are not significant despite growing. March 27 ( Figures 6E and 6E') is 785 the start of the important and rapid reduction phase of all clusters (see Figure 1B) . The merged 786 clusters of the Lausanne area split and most of those located on the country-side are steady. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprintThe copyright holder for this this version posted February 19, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.16.21251641 doi: medRxiv preprint",

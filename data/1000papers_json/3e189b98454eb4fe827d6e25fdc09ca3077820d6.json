            "text": "COVID-19 represents the most severe global crisis to date whose public conversation can be studied in real time. To do so, we use a data set of over 350 million tweets and retweets posted by over 26 million English speaking Twitter users from January 13 to June 7, 2020. In characterizing the complex retweet network, we identify several stable communities, and are able to link them to scientific expert groups, national elites, and political actors. We find that scientific expert communities received a disproportionate amount of attention early on during the pandemic, and were leading the discussion at the time. However, as the pandemic unfolded, the attention shifted towards both national elites and political actors, paralleled by the introduction of country-specific containment measures and the growing politicization of the debate. Scientific experts remained present in the discussion, but experienced less reach and a higher degree of segregation and isolation. Overall, the emerging communities are characterized by an increased self-amplification and polarization. This makes it generally harder for information from international health organizations or authorities to reach a broad audience. These results may have implications for information dissemination in future global crises.",

Research finds that during a time of crisis, when information is scarce and heavily sought after, social media enables the critical flow of information due to its collaborative nature [5, 6] . However, the underlying network and community structure is likely to have a significant influence over which information users are exposed to [7, 8] . In particular, retweet interactions have been shown to reflect real-life community structure, such as political parties [9] , and to characterize the information sharing dynamics of different clusters of users [10] . Likewise, communities of users sharing misleading news tend to be more connected and clustered [11] .",

Even though it has been observed that false information travels faster in social networks [13, 14] , the work finds that Twitter users have made efforts to diffuse reliable information by such key experts. Related work demonstrates how the association between the geographical location of users dictates topics of conversations, thereby matching the temporal and geographical spread of the Zika outbreak [15] .",

As the virus spread across the world within only a few weeks, Twitter became the primary news source among expert groups and medical personnel. Reliable sources, such as peer-reviewed literature or other officially vetted channels, were simply too slow to be useful during this time [16] . However, this initially positive role of Twitter and other social media has now been overshadowed by the spread of numerous conspiracy theories and other low-quality mis-and disinformation about the pandemic, peaking in what the WHO now considers an \"infodemic\" [17, 18] . Preliminary work focused on this issue and used social network analysis in order to determine drivers of the conspiracy theory which claims a link between 5G and COVID-19 [19] . Although misinformation is a major concern, more recent work suggests that experts and authorities are being heard and have received disproportionate attention [20] , but that key specialists may experience low reachability [21] . Moreover, other work finds that key medical professionals and scientific experts may experience lower \"sustained amplification\", meaning that the attention given to this group has not been constant, and overall lower, compared to media outlets or key political figures [22] . Our work attempts to clarify the somewhat ambiguous premises about the role of experts during the pandemic.",

Users with an out-degree higher than 1500 represent the 0.1% of the users in the network, but their tweets have been retweeted >200M times (77.0% of all retweets). The community detection algorithm reveals thousands of communities, spanning from millions down to duplets, with size decreasing very sharply ( Figure S2 ). By aggregating over multiple repetitions of the algorithm, we identify 15 communities (labeled with letters from A to O, in decreasing order of size) with more than 105 users, encompassing 97.9% of all users in the giant component. Figure 1a shows the network of 1M users (corresponding to 4.3% of all nodes) randomly sampled but forming a connected component. Even if the layout algorithm has no information about the communities we identified, it recovers a similar stratification of the nodes. We observe that communities A and B fill a great portion of the network, without being as densely connected as the other communities. Some communities (C, H, F, L) are more peripheral and exhibit a neat modular structure, which implies a high degree of internal connectivity (see also Fig S3) .",

We identify an initial peak in total number of users in the beginning of February (peak a), and a second one at the end of March (peak b). These two peaks presumably correspond to the first diffusion of news about COVID-19 in China and, later, to their diffusion worldwide ( Figure S5 ).

Originally proposed in the context of academic citations [24] , the h-index in this case reflects that the user has received at least h retweets on h of their original tweets. Generally, users belonging to the political supercommunity are ranked highest both in terms of retweets and h-index, receiving most of the attention both on a punctual and an extended time scale. National elites and international experts behave very similarly: they rank medium to high in terms of h-index, but low in the number of retweets received (low virality). Lastly, the \"Other\" category ranks generally lowest in h-index and intermediate in retweets, thus is characterized by a higher virality in terms of attention.",

We find that international experts scored very highly in both metrics initially and then experienced a drop in ranks.

We are able to confirm that scientific experts were heard early on in the pandemic, as found by [20] . This also fits in well with previous literature, which confirms that Twitter users amplify information from trusted sources in crisis situations [25, 26, 27] . Further, we detect and trace these groups on the interaction network level and find that the reachability and attention of scientific experts, as received both from within the group and from outside, has declined over time, as indicated by earlier work [21] . We can partially confirm previous work [22] that suggested low sustained attention to top medical experts. However, by giving a temporal dimension to our analysis, we find that scientific experts ranked highest both in sustained and punctual attention in the very beginning of the pandemic and only later became increasingly isolated in terms of attention. We believe this is an important result which underlines the role of scientific experts as possible boundary spanners during the early phase of a pandemic.",

The nodes of the network represent users who have at least once retweeted or have been retweeted by another user. An edge was established from user A to user B if B retweeted A at least once during the whole period of data collection. Therefore, the edge direction indicates the flow of information. We assigned a weight to this edge equal to the number of times user B has retweeted user A. The reconstructed (weighted and directed) network has 22.9M nodes and 177M unique edges. In order to study the communities in this network, we consider only the largest connected component of the network, consisting of 22.5M nodes and 176M unique edges. The discarded components only consisted of isolated nodes or duplets, making up 1.57% of the nodes and 0.13% of the edges in the original network. We ran Louvain's community detection algorithm [29] , as implemented in Python's package Networkit [30] . The algorithm attempts to detect clusters of nodes by recursively maximizing the network's modularity. Standard modularity was adopted as a scoring function, meaning that intra-cluster edges were counted with the same weight as inter-clusters edges. For the community detection task, we considered the network edges as undirected in order to reduce the computational burden. Due to the stochasticity of the clustering algorithm, we ran 50 trials and assigned each node to the community it was most frequently associated with. The identification of largest communities was found to be stable both among repeated runs of the algorithm ( Figure S6 ) as well as when comparing monthly time windows of the dataset ( Figure  S7 , please refer to SI 1.3 for further details). Thus, the results of the community detection can be considered as fairly robust. The coordinates of the network layout in Figure 1 were processed by Gephi software [31] , using the ForceAtlas2 algorithm [32] with gravity set to 0.05 with the \"stronger gravity\" option enabled.",

The local-geocode library makes use of the geonames database and performs substring matching against place names in this database in order to obtain structured geographical information (also known as geocoding). In the matching, only places with a population larger than 30k are considered. local-geocode has been compared against geopy 2 (using the Nominatim library), which is frequently used for this task. Visual inspections of the country-level disagreements between both tools, indicate that local-geocode generally performs better in this task. This is likely due to the fact that local-geocode only considers relatively well known places, therefore ignoring imaginary names whereas geopy attempts to provide a (wrong) result in these cases. However, human-level benchmarking would need to be conducted in order to come to a final conclusion on the performance of both tools for Twitter user location decoding.",

On average, about 15 communities reached a size larger than 10 5 (15.42 \u00b1 0.09) (see Supplementary Fig. 2) . In order to assign each user to a community, we counted how many times each node appeared in the same community along the 50 trials (the same community was hypothesized to be that of maximal overlap within all trials). The ratio of times each node was found in the same community was used as a 0-1 score (\"community score\") about goodness of identification of the community associated to each node ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Furthermore, we analyzed the overlap of user IDs in communities obtained from the full network and from networks reconstructed with data aggregated per month. Retweets posted during January and February were lower than the rest of observational period, so we joined the two months into a single time-window. This means that four temporary networks were built aggregating the retweets sent during January-February, March, April, May 2020 separately. A fair stability over time was observed overall (see Supplementary Fig. 7) . Temporal stability was highest for the largest communities (labelled from A to H), having an average overlap of 72% (min 44%, max 94%) with the most overlapping temporary communities. Also smaller communities, in particular L, M, and J, showed a fair temporal stability (avg. overlap 57%, min 20%, max 89%).",

The international expert super-community, on the other hand, decreased internal sharing of content after March. Overall, we note that the dynamics partially mirror Figure 3c, since the internal attention component makes up most of the total attention given to the super-communities.",

Conclusion239The COVID-19 is a severe threat to human life and more than 500,000 deaths have240 been reported worldwide (as on 9 th July 2020). However, with the complete 241 restrictions on economic, social, educational, religious, and all other activities, this 242 lockdown is turning into a \"Blessing in disguise\" (Muhammad et al., 2020). The 243 authors attempted to analyze whether these restrictions have their impact on one of 244 the severely polluted west-flowing rivers in India. The analysis revealed that the 245 SPM concentrations in the Sabarmati river have reduced to a great extent. The 246 changes pre and during lockdown are very significant to understand the short-term, 247 as well as the long-term effect of anthropogenic activities on the hydrosphere. An 248 average decrease of 36.48% is observed in SPM concentrations during lockdown 249 compared to the pre-lockdown period albeit the domestic wastewater continues to 250 drain into the Sabarmati river and which eventually shows the degree to which the 251 industrial sewage discharge and other outdoor activities are deteriorating the 252 hydrosphere and severely polluting the river water. The effect of lockdown is also 253 clear on the air quality, as all the main parameters (NO2, PM2.5, and PM10) have decreased to a noticeable extent from the pre-lockdown period and NO2 255 concentrations are found to be minimum in last three years. However all these 256 human activities will resume sooner or later, and since the Sabarmati river is 257 surrounded by dense urban population, the pollutants may ultimately start 258 deteriorating the water and air quality again and the improvement reaped during 259 lockdown won't continue for long. Therefore, the Policymakers should take note of 260 these improved air and water quality conditions due to the ceased anthropogenic 261 activities and should plan the future urban dynamics accordingly. The present paper 262 can be used for analyzing the rate of decline in SPM concentrations, NO2, PM2.5, and 263 PM10 over the lockdown period and this could help in preparing future plan to Time series graph of (a) NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations for before and 268 during lockdown period in Ahmedabad (b) NO2 concentration for April (2018-2020).269 References 270 1.

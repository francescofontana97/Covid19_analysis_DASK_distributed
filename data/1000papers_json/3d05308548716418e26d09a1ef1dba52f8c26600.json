The emphasis in this work will be on the study of the propagation of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Various epidemiologically relevant assumptions will be imposed upon the problem, and a coupled system of first-order ordinary differential equations will be obtained. The model adopts the form of a nonlinear susceptibleexposed-infected-quarantined-recovered system, and we investigate it both analytically and numerically. Analytically, we obtain the equilibrium points in the presence and absence of the coronavirus. We also calculate the reproduction number and provide conditions that guarantee the local and global asymptotic stability of the equilibria. To that end, various tools from analysis will be employed, including Volterra-type Lyapunov functions, LaSalle's invariance principle and the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. To simulate computationally the dynamics of propagation of the disease, we propose a nonstandard finite-difference scheme to approximate the solutions of the mathematical model. A thorough analysis of the discrete model is provided in this work, including the consistency and the stability analyses, along with the capability of the discrete model to preserve the equilibria of the continuous system. Among other interesting results, our numerical simulations confirm the stability properties of the equilibrium points.",

After its identification in 2019, COVID-19 has been a source of active research from various scientific points of view, mainly due to the mortality rate derived from this disease and the inherent health complications. Indeed, to this day, the COVID-19 dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University reports a total of 5,439,559 cases in 188 countries around the World, along with 2,185,696 recovered individuals and 345,589 deaths worldwide [2] . On the other hand, the usual symptoms of this disease include fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath [3] , but it may develop to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, septic shock and blood clots, among other conditions [4, 5] . In some cases, these symptoms evolve rapidly resulting ultimately in a painful death. Needless to mention that there are other severe consequences on the propagation of this disease worldwide, including economic and financial outcomes which are difficult to assess at this stage of the pandemic. Some reports already have started to investigate these potential consequences at various geographic levels [6, 7] , though the full extent of the implications of the global spread of COVID-19 are still under scientific scrutiny.",

            "text": "As many other problems associated to the study of COVID-19, the reliable prediction of its dynamics is an important topic of investigation from the epidemiological point of view. In general, the dynamics of epidemics is a highly transited topic of research in mathematics and simulation. There are various families of models depending on the assumptions on the mechanisms of propagation. For example, there are susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) systems which have been used to model nonlinear incidence rates and double epidemic hypotheses [8] , susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) models which are employed to consider the awareness of the presence of a disease [9] , susceptibleexposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) models that predict the propagation of epidemics with non-local reaction functions [10] , susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) systems used to account for adjusted incidence and imperfect vaccinations [11] , among other examples. It is worth pointing out that most of the deterministic models available in the literature are based on the use of ordinary differential equations, which means that a constant diffusion among the population is assumed. However, there are approaches which hinge on the use of systems of partial differential equations in order to account for imperfect mixing modelled by diffusion [12, 13, 14, 15] . In the present work, we focus our attention to the spreading of COVID-19 in populations where the diffusion is constant.",

            "text": "It is important to realize that the most recent progresses in mathematical epidemiology give account of a vast variety of realistic mathematical models to describe the propagation of diseases [16] . Indeed, in addition to the usual models based on the use of ordinary or partial differential equations, there are reports on individual-based systems to describe the spreading of infectious diseases in clustered complex networks [17] , agent-based systems to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics and synchrony of influenza epidemics [18] , network-based models to provide control strategies in SIS systems [19] , stochastic models that consider ratio-dependent incidence rates [20] , statistical models for the problem of estimation in some epidemic scenarios [21] , among various other approaches. The analysis of those models has been a fruitful topic of research in the literature. Moreover, the reliable computational simulation of those systems has also become a cornerstone in order to propose pertinent applications [22] . In the case of models based on differential equations, consistency, stability and convergence of the numerical methodologies have been criteria for the reliability of the discretizations. However, in light that the variables under study are populations, emphasis has been done on the development of finite-difference schemes that preserve the positivity and/or boundedness of the solutions of epidemic problems [23, 24, 25] , as well as other approaches for more complicated scenarios [26] .",

The system will consist of a nonlinear set of coupled ordinary differential equations in which various real parameters are included. The use of such model is based on the current understanding of the mechanisms of propagation of COVID-19. In particular, the consideration of the subpopulations of susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined and recover individuals is strongly supported by both the effects of COVID-19 in human health and the measures adopted by the governments of all countries affected [27] . Various assumptions will be imposed on the problem considered in this work, and we will obtain a system of ordinary differential equations from those hypotheses. We will provide a stability analysis of the equilibrium points of the system in the presence and absence of COVID-19. The nature of the local stability of those equilibria will be thoroughly investigated with respect to the basic reproduction number. As a means to verify our theoretical results, we will propose a two-level finite difference discretization of the SEIQR model. Our approach will hinge on a non-local discretization of the continuous problem, and we will show that the discrete model has various numerical and structural properties which make it a desirable tool in the simulation of the SEIQR system. For instance, we will prove the linear stability of the scheme, along with its capability to preserve the positivity of solutions. This feature is of the utmost importance in view that the variables under investigation are population sizes [28, 29] . Some simulations will be provided to assess the validity of the theoretical results derived in this work.",

As we pointed out before, the system will be a general nonlinear SEIQR model with constant spatial diffusion. The assumptions on the derivation of the model will be provided therein, and the model will include various physically relevant constants to make it as realistic as possible. In that section, we will obtain the equilibrium points both in the presence and the absence of COVID-19. We will obtain the reproduction number in that stage, and various results on the local stability of the equilibria will be rigorously established. The numerical model employed to solve the SEIQR model is presented in Section 3. The scheme is a nonstandard model in the sense of R. E. Mickens [30] . We will show therein that the scheme is a stable technique which is able to preserve the positivity of the solutions. In other words, our computational methodology is a structure-preserving technique or, equivalently, a dynamically consistent technique. As the end of that section. we provide some simulations that illustrate the main analytical features of the numerical methodology, and we close this manuscript with a section of concluding remarks.

The model employed here consisted of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations of first order. Various constant parameters were used to describe the system and nonnegative initial conditions were employed. The method considered the presence of susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined and recovered populations in light of the known dynamics of COVID-19. The mathematical model was obtained from epidemiological assumptions, and equilibrium points were obtained considering the presence and the absence of the epidemic. The reproductive number was obtained, and the stability of the equilibria was established in terms of the values of the reproductive number. Both local and global stability were analyzed. Also, a finite-difference method was proposed to investigate computationally the dynamics of COVID-19. The method is nonlocal, and we proved the positivity of the scheme, along with the discrete stability of the equilibrium points. In addition, the numerical properties of consistency, stability and convergence were rigorously established. Some numerical simulations proved the validity of the theorems on the stability of the equilibrium points. In this way, the present work contributes to the design of SEIQR models to describe the dynamics of infectious diseases like COVID-19 [34] .",

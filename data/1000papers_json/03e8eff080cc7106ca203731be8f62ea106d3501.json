            "text": "A growing body of evidence suggests that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases may significantly contribute to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] [2] [3] [4] . It has been suggested that children are a reservoir for asymptomatic infection, but population-based studies in Iceland and Italy that assessed symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection found no infections in children <10 years of age [3, 5] . An understanding of the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in US communities is critical to designing effective infection prevention strategies. Data on asymptomatic infection in US children and adults in the community are not currently available. For this reason, we conducted a community-based study of the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults and children in Marion County, Indiana.",

Households with primarily underrepresented minorities (URM) were first invited to participate, and one week later, a subset of households was chosen according to the household having children, having newly registered URM, or according to the need for proportionate representation from 10 zip code clusters that comprised all of Marion County. Interested participants were sent an invitation to the screening survey using the secure, web-based software platform Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) hosted at Indiana University [6] . Eligible household members were then given a consent or assent (child aged 12-17) document to complete. ",

The sole infected individual was seven years of age, demonstrating, contrary to prior studies, that children under 11 years of age in the community may carry asymptomatic infection. The source of the child's infection was unclear, as no other household members tested positive. It is possible other family members in the home were previously infected and no longer shedding. Future serologic studies would be helpful and are planned. The positive result was reported to the Indiana State Department of Health for further evaluation and contact tracing.",

Our study's finding of a very low prevalence of asymptomatic infection provides reassurance on the benefits of the state implementation of social distancing measures, which went in to effect March 24th with a stay at home order and a phased reopening starting May 11th in Marion county. Even with this low prevalence, infection in one child out of 119 tested (0.84%) yields an estimate of 1977 children asymptomatically infected in Indianapolis/Marion County (95% CI 0, 6209). The large confidence intervals demonstrate the preliminary nature of this data. Larger studies of asymptomatic infection that include young children are needed to determine the relative prevalence of asymptomatic infection in children and adults with greater precision. Additionally, longitudinal studies across multiple geographic areas are needed to determine how prevalence varies in different areas, especially as social distancing measures are relaxed. Testing of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in these individuals could help to determine the rate of past infection, another important measure for which there is little data in children. Antibody testing is planned in this cohort. The increasing reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) temporally associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, most of which appears to have been asymptomatic [10] [11] [12] , underscore the importance and urgency of increasing our understanding of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potential sequelae in children.",

The primary limitations were the relatively small sample size for a population study and the non-random selection of study participants. Despite the small sample size, we were able to detect low frequency infection, but the 95% confidence intervals of the estimates included zero, so the study data are best viewed as important initial data on which to base future studies of asymptomatic infection in children and adults. We chose a non-random recruitment process because we had a research registry that mirrored overall population demographics and therefore was likely to provide a sample representative of the geographic and racial diversity of the county/city population. Additionally, study enrollment required access to internet/email which may have biased our population to a higher socioeconomic class. Random selection might have derived a population more fully representative of the county population, but participation rates would likely have been far lower, and the final sample may not have been substantially different from the sample we obtained.",

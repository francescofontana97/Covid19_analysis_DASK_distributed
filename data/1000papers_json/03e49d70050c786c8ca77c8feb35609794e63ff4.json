            "text": "Artemis (DCLRE1C) is an endonuclease that plays a key role in development of B-and Tlymphocytes and in DNA double-strand break repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Artemis is phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs and acts to open DNA hairpin intermediates generated during V(D)J and class-switch recombination. Consistently, Artemis deficiency leads to radiosensitive congenital severe immune deficiency (RS-SCID). Artemis belongs to a structural superfamily of nucleases that contain conserved metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (MBL) and \u03b2-CASP (CPSF-Artemis-SNM1-Pso2) domains. Here, we present crystal structures of the catalytic domain of wild type and variant forms of Artemis that cause RS-SCID Omenn syndrome. The truncated catalytic domain of the Artemis is a constitutively active enzyme that with similar activity to a phosphorylated full-length protein. Our structures help explain the basis of the predominantly endonucleolytic activity of Artemis, which contrast with the predominantly exonuclease activity of the closely related SNM1A and SNM1B nucleases. The structures also reveal a second metal binding site in its \u03b2-CASP domain that is unique to Artemis. By combining our structural data that from a recently reported structure we were able model the interaction of Artemis with DNA substrates. Moreover, co-crystal structures with inhibitors indicate the potential for structure-guided development of inhibitors.",

This reveals that Artemis possesses a unique feature, that is not present in SNM1A and SNM1B/Apollo, i.e., a second metal binding site in its \u03b2-CASP domain that bears a resemblance to classical Cys2His2 zinc finger motifs. We propose that this second metal coordination site is involved in Artemis stabilisation and substrate specificity. We also present a model for Artemis DNA binding based on our data and another recently published structure. The Artemis DNA model is compared with models of DNA binding from related nucleases to reveal distinct features that define a role for Artemis in the end-joining reaction. Following development of an assay suitable for inhibitor screens, we identified drug-like molecules that could potentially inhibit both the Artemis active site and its essential zinc finger-like motif.",

Using the high-fidelity and highprocessivity enzyme Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase (Agilent), a PCR was performed to amplify a whole plasmid.

Exonucleases are often non sequencespecific, while endonucleases can be further grouped into sequence-specific endonucleases, such as restriction enzymes, and structure-selective endonucleases [1] . Artemis (also known as SNM1C or DCLRE1C), along with SNM1A (DCLRE1A) and Apollo (SNM1B or DCLRE1B), are human nucleases that fall into the extended structural family of metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (MBL) fold enzymes [2, 3] . The N-terminal region of Artemis is predicted to have a core MBL fold (aa 1-155, 385-361) with an inserted \u03b2-CASP (CPSF73, Artemis, SNM1 and PSO2) domain (aa 156-384). \u03b2-CASP domains are present within the larger family of eukaryotic nucleic acid processing MBLs and confer both DNA/RNA binding and nuclease activity [2] .

            "text": "Although SNM1A, SNM1B, and Artemis are predicted to have similar core structures for their catalytic domains, each have distinct cellular functions and substrate specificities. While SNM1A and SNM1B/Apollo are exclusively 5' to 3' exonucleases, the predominant activity of Artemis is endonucleolytic [5, 7] , although a minor 5' to 3' exonuclease activity has been reported [8] . Human SNM1A localises to sites of DNA damage, can digest past DNA damage lesions in vitro, and is involved in the repair of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) [9] [10] [11] . SNM1B/Apollo is a shelterin-associated protein required for resection at newlyreplicated leading-strand telomeres to generate the 3'-overhang necessary for telomere loop (t-loop) formation and telomere protection [12] [13] [14] . Both SNM1A and SNM1B/Apollo prefer ssDNA substrates in vitro, with an absolute requirement for a free 5'-phosphate [3, 15] . By contrast, Artemis prefers hairpins and DNA junctions as substrates for its endonuclease activity, although it is able to process ssDNA substrates [16] [17] [18] The endonuclease activity of Artemis is responsible for hairpin opening in variable (diversity) joining (V(D)J) recombination [19] and contributes to end-processing in the canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) DNA repair [20] [21] [22] [23] . V(D)J recombination is initiated by the recognition and binding of recombination-activating gene proteins (RAG1 and RAG2) to the recombination signal sequences (RSSs) adjacent to the V, D, and J gene segments. Upon binding, the RAG proteins induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) and create a hairpin at the coding ends [24] [25] [26] . The Ku heterodimer recognises the DNA doublestrand break and recruits DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and Artemis to mediate hairpin opening [17] . Following hairpin opening, the NHEJ machinery containing the XRCC4/XLF(PAXX)/DNA-Ligase IV complex is recruited to catalyse the processing and ligation reactions of the DNA ends [20, 27, 28] . V(D)J recombination is an essential process in antibody maturation [16, 29, 30] . Mutations in the Artemis gene cause aberrant hairpin opening resulting in severe combined immune deficiency (RS-SCID), with sensitivity to ionising radiation due to impairment of the predominant DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells, NHEJ [17, 19, 27] , and another form of SCID (Omenn syndrome) associated with hypomorphic Artemis mutations [31, 32] Thawed cell aliquots were lysed by sonication. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (40,000 g, 30 min), then the supernatant was passed through a 0.80 \u03bcm filter (Millipore) and loaded onto an equilibrated (lysis buffer) immobilised metal affinity chromatography column (IMAC) (Ni-NTA Superflow Cartridge, Qiagen). The immobilised protein was washed with lysis buffer, then eluted using a linear gradient of elution buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 5% v/v glycerol, and 1 mM TCEP). The protein containing fractions were pooled and passed through an ion exchange column (HiTrap\u00ae SP FF GE Healthcare Life Sciences) pre-equilibrated in the SP buffer A (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol and 1 mM TCEP). The protein was eluted using a linear gradient of SP buffer B (SP buffer A with 1 M NaCl), and fractions containing the tag-free Artemis were identified by electrophoresis.",

            "text": "The overall fold of human Artemis protein catalytic core is very similar to that of human SNM1A and SNM1B/Apollo (2 \u00c5 RMSD). It has the key structural characteristics of human MBL fold nucleases, with the di-metal containing active site interfaced between the MBL and \u03b2-CASP domains ( Figure 1A ). As anticipated, the MBL domain ( Figure 1A and 1B, in pink) of Artemis has the typical \u03b1/\u03b2-\u03b2/\u03b1 sandwich MBL fold [42] and contains all of the highly conserved motifs 1-4 ( Figure 1C and D; and sequence alignment, Suppl. Figure 2 ) which are typical for the whole MBL superfamily, and motif A-C which are typical of the \u03b2-CASP fold containing family [2, 27, 43, 44] . Figures 1D and 2C ) are responsible for metal ion coordination in both DNA and RNA processing MBL enzymes [44] . As previously observed in crystal structures of human SNM1A and Apollo/SNM1B, Artemis can coordinate one or two metal ions in its active site. One zinc ion (Zn1) in the active site is coordinated by four residues (His33, His35, His115, and Asp116) and two water molecules (H2O 506 and 611) in an octahedral manner ( Figure 2C ). The second zinc ion (Zn2) was refined with 30% occupancy and is coordinated by three residues (Asp37, His38, and Asp136) and two water molecules (H2O 506 and 529). The low occupancy of the second zinc ion, together with the two conformations (0.5 occupancy for each conformation) observed for Asp37 ( Figure 2E ) suggest that this site binds a metal ion less tightly than the Zn1 site, consistent with studies on other human MBL fold nucleases [3, Baddock et. al.,2020] The structure of human SNM1A (PDB: 5AHR) [3] was solved with a single zinc ion coordinated in the active site ( Figure 2A ). By contrast, SNM1B structures solved with a bound AMP (Baddock et. al., accompanying paper) showed that both metal ions are positioned to coordinate the phosphate group of the AMP in an octahedral manner ( Figure  2B ). In summary, the octahedral coordination sites for the first zinc ion are contributed to by three histidines, one aspartate residue, and either water molecules or a phosphate oxygen of the substrate; the second metal ion is more weakly coordinated in the SNM1 protein family, with one histidine and two aspartates, with the remaining three positions occupied by water or a phosphate oxygen of the DNA substrate. This can explain the partial occupancy of the second zinc position in SNM1 enzyme structures, where the full occupancy may be achieved only in presence of substrate. We propose that Artemis would coordinate a phosphate group of its substrate in a similar manner. The structure of human CPSF-73 (PDB: 2I7T), an RNA processing nuclease, with two active site bound zinc ions and a phosphate molecule [45] , shows that the two zinc ions are coordinated in a very similar geometry with the human MBL DNA processing enzymes. [46, 47] . A striking difference between the MBL RNA and DNA nucleases is that the second metal ion (M2) in the RNA processing nucleases is coordinated by an additional histidine residue (His418 for CPSF-73) [45] that is absent in the DNA processing enzymes ( Figure 2D ).",

Many DNA binding proteins, including transcription factors and a substantial number of DNA repair factors (including those involved in NHEJ), possess the classical Cys2 His2 zinc finger motif, that serves as a structural feature stabilising the DNA binding domain [49] [50] [51] [52] . A typical Cys2 His2 zinc coordinating finger ( Figure 3A ) has a \u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 motif, wherein the zinc ion is coordinated between an \u03b1-helix and two antiparallel \u03b2-sheets. The zinc ion confers structural stability and hydrophobic residues located at the sides of the zinc coordination site enable specific binding of the zinc finger in the major groove of the DNA [49, 50, 53, 54] . Similar to the canonical Cys2 His2 zinc finger motif, the zinc ion coordination in Artemis' \u03b2-CASP domain adopts a tetrahedral geometry, with coordination by two cysteine (Cys256 and Cys272) and two histidine (His228 and His254) residues (Figure 3 B). However, in the case of Artemis the metal ion coordination site is sandwiched between two \u03b2-sheets instead of an \u03b1-helix and two antiparallel \u03b2-sheets.",

For this structure, we are in general agreement with Karim et al that the DNA does not appear to make meaningful interactions with the protein that inform on the mechanism of nuclease activity, although this mode of association with DNA may possibly be relevant to alternative binding modes relating to higher order complexes containing Artemis. By contrast, for the 6WO0 structure we were able to confidently build a DNA molecule that contacts the Artemis active site in a manner that we believe to be relevant to the Artemis nuclease activity.",

The sequence of the longest strand corresponds to the 10-nucleotide cy-5 labelled strand (cy5-GCGATCAGCT) with some residual density at the 5\uf0a2-end that may be attributed to the cyanine fluorophore which we did not include in our model.

The 3\uf0a2-end of this strand apparently terminates directly above a cluster of polar or positively charged residues in the \u03b2-CASP domain (Lys207, Lys288, Asn205) ( Figure 6B ). Whilst the experimental (as used in co-crystallisation) DNA substrate and our model both contain a 3'-hydroxyl group, the model implies that addition of a 3'-phosphate could be accommodated and may be expected to make favourable interactions with the basic cluster of residues. Thus, our model illustrates a preferred binding mode for Artemis for DNA with a 5'-overhang binding at the junction between double-and single-stranded regions, and the expected product of this reaction would be a blunt ended DNA with a 5'-phosphate. In the case of hairpin DNA substrates our model indicates the possibility for Artemis to accommodate a loop connecting the two strands possibly of around 4-nucleotides or more, with the cleavage product being DNA with a 3'-overhang cleaved from the last paired base of the duplex.",

The overall mode of DNA binding is similar in the two models ( Figure  5) , with the two DNA duplexes being roughly parallel and forming contacts to similar regions on the MBL domain. The most important differences lie in the nature of the contacts formed to the active site and the paths of the various overhangs. In the SNM1B model extensive contacts are made to the 5\uf0a2-phosphate in a well-defined phosphate binding pocket. Both human SNM1A and SNM1B are exclusively 5\uf0a2-phosphate exonucleases, with most of these phosphate binding residues being highly conserved (sequence alignment Suppl. Figure 1 in yellow) (Baddock et. al accompanying paper). Interestingly, Artemis lacks these key phosphate binding residues and the 5\uf0a2-phosphate binding pocket of SNM1A and SNM1B. Instead, this pocket in Artemis is partially filled by the side chain of Phe318. These contacts appear to define a high-affinity binding pocket exclusively for the 5\uf0a2-phosphate of the DNA terminus, thus explaining the major differences in nuclease activities within the family, i.e., SNM1A and SNM1B being exonucleases and Artemis being an endonuclease. Further differences between Artemis and SNM1B/SNM1A are found in the loop connecting \u03b2-strands G and H (using Artemis numbering), which in Artemis is significantly longer and occupies a different position contacting residues in the MBL domain ( Figure 6B ) , compared to the loops in SNM1B and SNM1A that form part of the phosphate binding pocket and make potential contacts with the 3'-overhang. This loop displacement in Artemis may contribute to its ability in accommodating DNA substrates with either 5\uf0a2-overhangs or hairpins, thus facilitating its function as a structure specific endonuclease.",

One of the striking differences, at least in the available structures, is that the active site of Artemis is more open compared to those of SNM1A or SNM1B. This openness may reflect an ability to accommodate different substrate conformation including hairpins, 3'-and 5'-overhangs, as well as DNA flaps and gaps. Both human SNM1A and SNM1B appear to have a more sequestered active site that would only fit a single strand of DNA, which is consistent with previous findings on their preferred substrate selectivity [10] .",

We observed exonuclease activity with full-length Artemis at 10 nM (Suppl. Figure 8) , though this was weak compared to its endonuclease activity at the same concentration.

These studies reported that Artemis can digest substrates including overhangs, hairpins, stem-loops, and splayed arms (pseudo-Y). To investigate the activity of truncated Artemis catalytic domain (aa 1-361) we performed nuclease assays using a variety of radio-labelled DNA substrates ( Figure 7B ). The results show that truncated Artemis has substrate specific endonuclease activity, with a preference for single-stranded DNA susbstrates, and those that contain single stranded character (e.g. 5'-and 3'-overhangs, splayed arms, and a lagging flap structure), compared with double stranded DNA structures (e.g. ds DNA and a replication fork). This is in accordance with previous research, where Artemis has been reported to cleave around ssto dsDNA junctions in DNA substrates (perhaps cite Chang et al, 2015 for this). The truncated Artemis catalytic domain also exhibits hairpin opening activity, in accordance with what has previously been reported (Suppl. Fig. 9 ). On a duplex substrate (YM117 from Ma et al) [18] with a 20 nt hairpin region, Artemis cleaves adjacent to the hairpin, consistent with previous data. It is clear that truncated form of Artemis exhibits nuclease activity closely comparable to the phosphorylated full-length Artemis protein [18] , indicating that the structural studies presented here reveal mechanistic insights of direct relevance to the DNA-PKcs-associated form of Artemis that engages in end-processing reactions in vivo.",

Therefore, it is unsurprising that mutation of Asp37 to alanine results in the loss of Zn2. Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) experiments were carried out to investigate the stability of the three variants. DSF analysis showed that the D37A variant has similar thermal stability as the WT, suggesting that the protein is stable and folded in the presence of a single metal ion in the active site, whilst both H33A and H35D variants were substantially destabilized with \u0394Tm around -13 \u00b0C compared to the WT Artemis (Suppl.

Therefore, combining radiation therapy in conjunction with c-NHEJ inhibitors could selectively radiosensitise tumours. Weterings et al. have reported a compound that interferes with the binding of Ku70/80 to DNA, thereby increasing sensitivity to ionising radiation in human cell lines [64] ; ATM inhibitors are also in advanced clinical development and represent the most developed strategy to inhibit DSB repair to increase the efficacy of radiotherapy [65] Artemis, along with SNM1A and SNM1B, possess a conserved MBL-fold domain that is similar to the true bacterial MBLs. Previous studies on human SNM1A and SNM1B/Apollo, showed that ceftriaxone (Rocephin), a widely used \u03b2-lactam antibacterial (third generation cephalosporin) inhibits the nuclease activity of both SNM1A and SNM1B [66] . To investigate if this class of \u03b2-lactam anti-bacterial compounds could inhibit Artemis we performed fluorescence-based nuclease assays with three cephalosporins, i.e. ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and 7-aminocephalosporanic acid ( Figure 10A ). The results show that neither cefotaxime nor the parent compound, 7-aminocephalosporanic acid, potently inhibit Artemis' activity, whilst ceftriaxone inhibits Artemis with a modest IC50 of 65 \u00b5M ( Figure 10B ).",

There is no evidence for cleavage of the \u03b2-lactam ring nor of loss of the C-3' cephalosporin side chain, reactions that can occur during 'true' MBL catalysed cephalosporin hydrolysis. The electron density at the active site clearly reveals the presence of the ceftriaxone side chain in a position to coordinate the nickel ion (at the Zn1 site) replacing water molecules (waters 72 and 106) compared with the apo structure ( Figure 10D ). Despite the conservation of key elements of the active site of the MBL fold nucleases and the 'true' b-lactam hydrolysing MBLs [67] , ceftriaxone, does not interact with the nickel ion via its b-lactam ring (as occurs for the true MBLs), but via both carbonyl oxygens of the cyclic 1, 2 diamide in its sidechain (Ni-O distances: 2 \u00c5 and 2.2 \u00c5), i.e. it is not positioned for productive b-lactam hydrolysis. The amino-thiazole group (N7) of ceftriaxone forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Asn205, while the S1 of the 7-aminocephalosporanic acid core of the compound interacts with the hydroxyl of Tyr212 through an ethylene glycol molecule. The rest of the molecule appears to be flexible. The binding mode of ceftriaxone to Artemis shown in Figure 10C is near identical to that observed for ceftriaxone with SNM1A (PDB: 5NZW) structure (Suppl. Figure 11 ).",

Our structures of wild-type and catalytic site mutants of SNM1C/DCLRE1C or Artemis protein show that, like SNM1A and SNM1B/Apollo and the RNA processing enzyme CPSF73, Artemis has a typical \u03b1/\u03b2-\u03b2/\u03b1 sandwich fold in its MBL domain and has a \u03b2-CASP domain, the latter a characteristic feature of MBL fold nucleases. However, both our Artemis structures and those recently reported by Karim et. al [56] reveal a unique structural feature of Artemis in its \u03b2-CASP domain that is not reported in other human MBL enzymes, i.e. a classical zinc-finger like motif. Moreover, collectively, these structures allow us to assign a likely mode of DNA substrate interaction for Artemis.",

However, zincfinger motifs are common structural features in DNA binding proteins such as transcription factors [50, 54] , but are also observed in a substantial number of required and accessory NHEJ proteins [52] . These zinc fingers provide structural stability and enhance substrate selectivity rather than being involved in catalytic reactions, and we propose that this is likely to be the case for Artemis. The fact that the residues (His 228, His 254, Cys 256, and Cys 272) that are involved in the zinc-finger like motif are highly conserved across different Artemis species suggests the importance of this structural feature. Furthermore, point mutations in His 228 and His 254 (H228N and H254L) have been reported in patients with a SCID phenotype [55] .",

            "text": "The presence of one or two metal ions coordinated by the HxHxDH motif at the active site of Artemis reflects a hallmark of the SNM1 enzyme family [9, 74] ; the available evidence implies that metal ion binding at one site (Zn1 site in standard MBL nomenclature) is stronger than at the other (Zn2 site). By analogy with studies on the true MBLs, these metal ions are proposed to activate a water molecule that act as the nucleophile for the phosphodiester cleavage. Our structure (PDB: 7AF1) suggests that the native metal ion(s) residing in the active site of Artemis is zinc, although a nickel ion can also occupy the same site depending on the how the protein was purified (PDB: 6TT5). Neither the presence of Ni ion in the active site, nor the truncation of the C-terminal tail appear to inhibit, at least substantially, the activity of Artemis. Thus, using radio-labelled gel-based nuclease assays, we showed that the truncated Artemis catalytic domain (aa 1-361) with either Zn or Ni ions in the active site (as observed crystallographically in the same preparations) have similar activity with the full-length Artemis construct (aa 1-693). Therefore, it seems likely that nickel ions are able to replace zinc ions in solution, but catalysis of MBL fold enzymes, including hydrolytic reactions, with metal ions other than zinc is well-precedented [67, 75] We also solved structures of three Artemis catalytic mutants; D37A, H33A, and an Omenn syndrome patient mutation, H35D. Using gel-based nuclease assays, we showed that these variants are biochemically inactive. Overall, the three variant structures are similar to the WT structure, even though H33A and H35D entirely lack any metal ions in the active site, although zinc was present in the zinc finger. Mutation of Asp37 to alanine results in the loss of the second metal in the catalytic site, likely explaining the loss of activity, although the first metal ion is still present. Note that some MBL fold hydrolases uses two metal ions (e.g.,B1 and B3 subfamilies of the true MBLs and RNase J1 from Bacillus subtilis) (Suppl. Figure 13A and C) [67, 76] whereas others, sometimes with apparently very similar active sites, only use one metal ion (e.g. the B2 subfamily of the true MBLs and RNase J from Staphylococcus epidermis) [67, 77] (Suppl. Figure 13B and D) . Thus, whilst our results support the importance of having both metals for the nuclease activity by Artemis, subtle features can influence MBL fold enzyme activity [67, 74] .",

By contrast both SNM1A and SNM1B/Apollo are strictly 5\u202b-\u05f3\u202cphosphate exonucleases [3, 9, 15] . The recent structure of SNM1B/Apollo in complex with two deoxyadenosine monophosphate nucleotides (PDB code: 7A1F) reported by , reveals a cluster of residues that form a 5 \u202b\u05f3\u202c -phosphate binding pocket, adjacent to the metal centre. Structural sequence alignments of the three proteins shows that these residues are highly conserved in SNM1A and SNM1B (Suppl. Figure 1) . Apart from Ser 317, none of these conserved phosphate binding pocket residues are present in Artemis. Instead, the pocket is partially occupied by the Phe318 side chain, which is absent in both SNM1A and SNM1B. Artemis also possesses a longer and more flexible loop connecting \u03b2strands 27 and 28 ( Figure 6B ), compared to the same loop in SNM1A and SNM1B that make up part of the 5 \u202b\u05f3\u202c -phosphate binding pocket. The flexibility of this loop could enable accommodation with different types of DNA structures, such as hairpins, and 5 \u202b\u05f3\u202c -overhangs. These differences plausibly explain Artemis' substrate preferences and its primary activity as a structure-selective endonuclease.",

Notably, ceftriaxone does not bind with its b-lactam carbonyl located at the active site where it ligates to one zinc (or other metal) ion, but instead binds the single nickel ion in bidentate manner via the carbonyls of its cyclic 1,2 diamide on its C-3' sidechain.

Our results show that both ebselen and disulfiram inhibit Artemis (IC50s 8.5 \u00b5M and 10.8 \u00b5M, respectively), whilst auranofin is less potent (IC5046 \u00b5M).",

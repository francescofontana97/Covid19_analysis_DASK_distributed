While there may be value in reducing elective medical treatments during the coronavirus pandemic, emergency care is essential for patients with severe heart problems, appendicitis, paralytic ileus, or advanced cancer. Patients and physicians alike must not hesitate to seek or direct care in such cases, where delay will lead to preventable adverse outcomes, including death.",

Other than more common risks such as tobacco smoking or base-jumping, dread risks are determined by three characteristics: Dread risks can kill a whole group of human beings at once; they generally are beyond human control to avoid; and, they generate horrifying images that take us back to the disaster over and over again.",

To avoid being subject to another such terrorist hijacking, U.S. residents more often used their cars for longer-distance travel. Even though commercial aircrafts provide safer transport, the subjective feeling of having control over their own vehicles kept up to 20% of domestic airline customers away. The terrifying pictures of the collapsing twin towers, the recordings of the passengers' screams, and the fear of being at the mercy of a terrorist hijacker caused anxiety that prevented people from making rational choices. Consequent to this extreme risk-avoidance behavior, the number of road traffic fatalities in the U.S. rose by about 4% after 9/11. In the first year after the terrorist attacks, approximately 1,600 additional people died in car accidents, presumably trying to avoid airline-related terrorism, which is more than 6 times the number of the 256 passengers who were killed in the four airplanes in September 2001.1 -3",

RoMed is the health system serving the region of Rosenheim and a community of 350,000 people by providing inpatient and outpatient care in four hospitals.

Of these 349 cases, 98 patients were still in hospital care as of April 14 ( Figure 1 ).",

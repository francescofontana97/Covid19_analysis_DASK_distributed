Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an important tumor marker, whose level in patients is of great significance for diagnosis of many diseases. Here, we report the identification of LDH aptamers by 9 rounds of screening from a length-mixed single-stranded DNA library using the SELEX technology. After the 3rd and 7th rounds of aptamer screening, affinity was significantly improved, and fluorescence quantitative analysis showed stronger affinity for the aptamers selected from the 7th to 9th rounds of screening. After highthroughput sequencing, motif analysis, and secondary structure prediction, we finally chose and further investigated 15 candidate LDH aptamer sequences with obvious differences in secondary structure in the 7th to 9th rounds of screening. Among them, LDH7-1, LDH7-9, LDH8-2, and LDH9-1 were shown to bind to LDH protein with high affinity and specificity with K d < 25 nM. This study provides new ideas for rapid detection of LDH protein content and enzyme activity, thus contributing to the development of rapid medical detection.",

            "text": "Compared with normal cells, malignant tumor cells are characterized biochemically by their high glycolytic activity and the ability to produce large amounts of lactic acid [1] . Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a key enzyme in the glycolysis process, catalyzes the production of lactic acid during the reduction reaction of the pyrrole ring, coupled with the mutual conversion of NADH and NAD + . This enzyme exists in human tissues in the form of 5 independent isoenzymes, with each isoenzyme consisting of two subunits A and B, which are respectively composed of a tetramer encoded by independent genes [2] . LDH exists in almost all types of cells in the human body, most commonly in myocardium, skeletal muscle, and red blood cells, and LDH varies in its form in different tissues, with LDH-1 in cardiomyocytes, LDH-2 in the reticular endothelial system, LDH-3 in the lungs, LDH-4 in the kidneys and plasma, and LDH-5 in the liver and striated muscle [3] . Meanwhile, LDH is a cancer detection marker, whose level in patient serum, cultured cells, and tumor tissues is of great significance for early diagnosis of tumors [4] . Determining the LDH level in patients can help the diagnosis of various types of cancers, such as oral cancer [5] , stomach cancer [6] , lung cancer [7] , cervical cancer [8] , or breast cancer [9] , because patients with such cancers usually show an increase in the LDH expression level relative to healthy people, which is a sign of poor tumor prognosis. LDH is not only a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of cancer cells, but also can make tumor cells escape or suppress the immune system by changing the tumor microenvironment [10] . Additionally, statistics of the new type of coronavirus (COVID-19) revealed a certain correlation between the increase of LDH levels in patients and the poor prognosis of the disease process, i.e., an increase in the LDH level in COVID-19 patients suggests a 6-fold increase in disease severity and a 16-fold increase in mortality risk [11] . Among pediatric patients, LDH level is higher in girls than in boys [12] .",

Nucleic acid aptamers are small fragments of singlestranded DNA or RNA molecule that can bind to the target substance with high specificity and affinity, and they can be obtained by in vitro screening of artificially synthesized oligonucleotide libraries through systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) [13] . There are a wide variety of target substances for nucleic acid aptamers, such as proteins, living cells, microorganisms, viruses, small biological molecules, and even tissues [14] . Nucleic acid aptamers are also called \"chemical antibodies,\" but when compared with antibodies, aptamers can be obtained through in vitro screening without animal experiments and have the advantages of a shorter production cycle, labeling and modification by chemical synthesis, higher stability, and longer storage time. Previous studies have shown that the dissociation constant (K d ) of the binding of nucleic acid aptamers to the target substance can reach the nanomolar or even picomolar level, with the specific antibody-antigen binding affinity being equivalent or even higher than that of antibody [15] . In the past few years, great progress has been in the SELEX technology, leading to the emergence of Cell-SELEX, Tissue-SELEX, and other technologies, greatly increasing the target materials of aptamers, and facilitating the application of aptamers in the medical field [16] [17] [18] [19] . Meanwhile, aptamer screening has been greatly improved by combining microfluidic chip technology with SELEX technology, and aptamer screening for multiple targets can be completed in just a few hours [20, 21] . Nucleic acid aptamers not only have a good application prospect in diagnosis of tumors and diseases, but also can be used in combination with a variety of drugs or nanomaterials for targeted therapy of tumors to improve drug delivery efficiency, reduce toxicity to normal cells, alleviate stress, assuage side effects, and improve the quality of life of cancer patients [22, 23] .",

In the catalyzation process of lactate dehydrogenase, NAD+ is reduced to NADH. Generated NADH and INT (2-p-iodophenyl-3-nitrophenyl tetrazolium chloride) are catalyzed into a strong chromophore (formazan) by diaphorase. Formazan has an absorption peak at a wavelength of 490 nm, which is used to determine the activity of lactate dehydrogenase [24] . However, the colorimetric method still has many shortcomings. Human serum is a mixture of various proteins, leading to interference of LDH enzyme activity by other substances. Besides, the colorimetric method is seriously affected by the reaction time and temperature, which causes the inaccuracy on the quantitative detection of LDH enzyme activity. In this study, 9 rounds of aptamer screening were carried out, and 4 aptamer sequences with high affinity and specificity to LDH protein were obtained. This study provides new ideas for rapid detection of tumor markers and shows the possibility for home detection of disease serum markers, thus promoting the development of rapid medical detection.",

As shown in Fig. 1a , lanes 1 and 2 showed that there was no LDH protein in normal human serum. Besides, there was obvious LDH protein band in lane 3, and the presence of LDH protein band in lane 4 indicated that LDH protein can be coupled with carboxyl magnetic beads. The SELEX screening process is shown in Fig. 1b . Specifically, in each round, the ssDNA library was incubated with normal human serum as a negative screening, while small fragments of salmon sperm DNA were incubated with magnetic bead-coupled LDH protein to block the non-specific binding sites. Next, the ssDNA unbound to normal human serum was incubated with the magnetic beads coupled with LDH protein to obtain the ssDNA specifically binding to LDH protein. Finally, the ssDNA was dissociated and used as a template for PCR amplification, and the recovered PCR product was used for HTS sequencing and the next round of screening. Negative screening with normal human serum as the target can pre-clear aptamers in the ssDNA library that can bind to other targets in normal human serum and improve the specificity of the library in the subsequent screening [29] . In the case of fixed LDH protein content, blocking non-specific binding sites by salmon sperm DNA can reduce the number of binding sites between LDH protein and ssDNA library, thereby inhibiting the enrichment of low-affinity aptamers and only retaining high-affinity aptamers [30] . In order to increase the diversity of the initial ssDNA library to obtain aptamer sequences with stronger affinity and specificity with the LDH protein, we constructed a special library with four sub-libraries of different lengths (Fig. 1c) . In order to obtain more comprehensive and true information about aptamers and compare their differences between rounds, we used HTS sequencing to analyze the aptamers obtained in each round.",

After each round of incubation, fluorescence microscopy imaging was used to detect the binding intensity of the library with the LDH protein. As shown in Fig. 2a , no fluorescence was observed in the magnetic beads and LDH, indicating that the initial library cannot bind to LDH. After the first and second rounds of screening, the aptamers showed weak binding affinity to LDH protein. After the third round of screening, aptamers were seen to gradually bind to LDH, with obvious fluorescence observed in the 7th to 9th round libraries, indicating their strong binding ability. Wang J also used negative screening to select renal cell carcinoma (RCC) aptamers and obtained enriched sequences after 12 rounds of screening [31] . In the present study, from the third round onward, a more obvious enrichment signal appeared and reached the peak in the 7th round. A possible explanation is that the initial ssDNA library has a larger capacity and may have a richer secondary structure, thereby improving the screening efficiency. The fluorescence intensity analysis also showed a significant increase between rounds 2 and 3 as well as rounds 6 and 7, with a very strong intensity in rounds 7-9 and maximal intensity in round 7. Meanwhile, we calculated the proportion of the magnetic beads with fluorescence intensity greater than 30. The calculation was consistent with the fluorescence intensity result, with the peak in the seventh round (Fig. 2b, c) . For quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity, we used a fluorescence spectrophotometer to measure the fluorescence values of the aptamers dissociated from the initial, 7th, 8th, and 9th libraries. After standard curve determination and statistical analysis, the affinity was shown to be significantly higher in the SELEX-screened libraries than the initial library (Fig. 2d ).",

Among them, N30 accounted for the largest proportion and gradually increased with the screening round, while N60 accounted for the lowest proportion and decreased continuously with the screening round. In the 1-9 rounds, N50 and N60 accounted for a stable proportion with small fluctuations, indicating that the secondary structure formed by 30-40 nt ssDNA can more easily bind to LDH protein.

The NUPACK website was used to predict the secondary structure of part of the highly conserved sequences selected in rounds 1 to 9, and these sequences were seen to have relatively abundant stem-loop structures (Fig. 4) , which provide sufficient sites for the specific binding of aptamer and LDH protein. Compared with clone sequencing, the sequences selected through high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis showed significantly higher enrichment in the secondary structure and conserved elements [32] [33] [34] . Based on the affinity results in different rounds of screening, candidate LDH protein aptamer sequences with higher affinity were selected from the 7th, 8th, and 9th round aptamer libraries to further verify their affinity and specificity. By comparing the A and G conservation degree of the sequences, we finally selected 15 sequences with high conservation degree and large difference in the secondary structure as candidate LDH protein aptamer sequences.

Incubation of the 15 candidate sequences with normal human serum showed no red fluorescence in the microscope imaging, indicating significant negative screening effect. Under the same conditions, the fluorescently labeled aptamer candidate sequences were incubated with LDH protein. Obvious fluorescence was shown from LDH7-1, LDH7-5, LDH7-9, LDH8-2, LDH8-3, LDH9-1, and LDH9-2, whose coupling effect is better and fluorescence is stronger than that of other sequences based on the microscope imaging. Meanwhile, their specific binding to LDH protein was more stable, with fluorescent signals in almost all magnetic beads.",

Statistical analysis showed significant difference among these 15 candidate sequences in their binding affinity to LDH protein and normal human serum, with a better performance for LDH7-1, LDH7-9, LDH8-2, and LDH9-1 than the other candidate sequences. Meanwhile, we calculated the percentage of magnetic beads with a fluorescence intensity greater than 50, and the four sequences (LDH7-1, LDH7-9, LDH8-2, and LDH9-1) were also shown to have a significantly higher ratio, all higher than 60% (Fig. 6) . To identify the affinity of candidate aptamers with the LDH protein, the method of fluorescence assay was used to determine the dissociation constant (K d ) [21] . After kinetic curve fitting, the K d of LDH7r-1, LDH7r-9, LDH8r-2, and LDH9r-1 are respectively 21.3 \u00b1 3.9 nM, 12.0 \u00b1 4.4 nM, 10.2 \u00b1 4.7 nM, and 19.3 \u00b1 6.2 nM (Fig. 7) . These four candidate aptamer sequences all have strong affinity with LDH protein, and the binding amount is significantly higher compared with the initial library. These 4 aptamer sequences have the potential use for LDH content and enzyme activity detections, which could further combine with the microfluidic chip and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to construct a high-efficiency and low-cost method for rapid disease diagnosis.",

Triangle represents one of the 15 selected candidate LDH aptamer sequences technology, and the affinity was significantly improved in the 3rd and 7th rounds of selection. Through highthroughput sequencing, motif analysis, and secondary structure prediction, we finally selected 15 aptamer sequences in the 7th-9th rounds of screening, and four of them (LDH7-1, LDH7-9, LDH8-2, LDH9-1) were shown to bind to LDH protein with high affinity and specificity. This study laid an experimental foundation for the rapid detection of LDH protein content and enzyme activity and also provided new ideas for the rapid detection of other serum markers. ",

            "text": "To achieve the ambitious targets for tuberculosis (TB) prevention, care, and control stated by the End TB Strategy, new health care strategies, diagnostic tools are warranted. Hostderived biosignatures are explored for their TB diagnostic potential in accordance with the WHO target product profiles (TPPs) for point-of-care (POC) testing. We aimed to identify sputum-independent TB diagnostic signatures in newly diagnosed adult pulmonary-TB (PTB) patients recruited in the context of a prospective household contact cohort study conducted in Andhra Pradesh, India. Whole-blood mRNA samples from 158 subjects (PTB, n = 109; age-matched household controls, n = 49) were examined by dual-color Reverse-Transcriptase Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe-Amplification (dcRT-MLPA) for the expression of 198 pre-defined genes and a Mesoscale discovery assay for the concentration of 18 cytokines/chemokines in TB-antigen stimulated QuantiFERON supernatants. To identify signatures, we applied a two-step approach; in the first step, univariate filtering was used to identify and shortlist potentially predictive biomarkers; this step may be seen as removing redundant biomarkers. In the second step, a logistic regression approach was used such that group membership (PTB vs. household controls) became the binary response in a Lasso regression model. We identified an 11-gene signature that distinguished PTB from household controls with AUCs of \u22650.98 (95% CIs: 0.94-1.00), and a 4-protein signature (IFNg, GMCSF, IL7 and IL15) that differentiated PTB from household controls with AUCs of \u22650.87 (95% CIs: 0.75-1.00), in our discovery cohort. Subsequently, we evaluated the performance of the 11-gene signature in two external validation data sets viz, an independent cohort at the Glenfield Hospital, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester, UK (GSE107994 data set), and the Catalysis treatment response cohort (GSE89403 data set) from South Africa. The 11-gene signature validated and distinguished PTB from healthy and asymptomatic INTRODUCTION Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and the single infectious pathogen responsible for the most deaths-even after the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic. In 2018, a total of 1.5 million lives were lost to TB (1), and the goals of the End TB Strategy; to achieve a 90% reduction in TB incidence and a 95% reduction in TB mortality by 2035, are challenging (2) . Much of the mortality attributed to TB occur in low-resource settings, so effective diagnostic tests applicable in these settings are essential to meet these goals. The WHO has defined the performance and operational characteristics of tests applicable for primary care or at the point-of-care (POC) in its high-priority target product profiles (TPPs) (3) . To meet the TPPs, a rapid biomarker-based test would ideally be i) instrument-free or feasible with limited instrumentation and ii) based on easily accessible samples such as blood, urine, or breath (4).",

The top priority is a rapid biomarker-based, non-sputum POC test i) to detect TB disease and guide immediate initiation of TB treatment, thus avoiding loss of cases from diagnostic delay (3, 5) , and ii) for triage, ruling out TB disease with high sensitivity, allowing targeted referral to more expensive and accurate confirmatory tests (6) . Ideally, such POC tests would perform satisfactorily with pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease in both children and adults regardless of HIV coinfection (7) . In recent years, there have been exciting developments, including sputum-based and non-sputum-based TB diagnostics. However, the Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) test, which detects M. tuberculosis (Mtb) complex LAM in urine, is hitherto the only non-sputum test endorsed by WHO.",

Although expensive and resource-demanding, genome-wide analyses of transcriptomes offer unbiased identification of genes and immunologic pathways relevant for the understanding of TB pathogenesis, and risk of progression to disease (21) (22) (23) . In the search for a unifying signature, a landmark study by Sweeney et al. (24) using data from publicly available human genome repositories, identified a 3-gene signature (3-gene TB score) derived from three discovery datasets of adults, that separated subjects with TB from healthy controls, Mtb infection, and other diseases in validation datasets of children and adults. However, the mean diagnostic accuracy obtained in the validation sets did not meet initial WHO criteria for a diagnostic POC test. Subsequently, Warsinke HC et al. (25) evaluated the performance of the 3-gene TB score in three different TB cohorts (25) (26) (27) and found that outcomes approached the WHO TTP benchmarks for a non-sputum-based triage test, with a high negative predictive value. Further, a very recent study evaluated 27 eligible identified signatures in a systematic meta-review, from which four signatures (Sweeney3, Kaforou25, Roe3, and BATF2) fulfilled the WHO minimum diagnostic accuracy parameters required for a TB triage test (28) .",

In short, the approach consisted of 1) univariate feature selection analysis using logistic regression, selecting markers by applying stringent p-value (p<0.01), and LASSO regression analysis based on the markers identified in step 1. The resulting LASSO model fits provided estimated coefficients (not reported in the present study, see Sivakumaran et al. (30) for an example). The model fits also enabled prediction of the probability of being a PTB for each participant. A predicted probability of >0.5 resulted in classification as a PTB case and <0.5 resulted in classification as a control. This model-based classification was compared to the actual \"true\" classification of participants and the number of correctly classified participants could be identified. Specifically, the predictive abilities of the signatures (to classify participants correctly) in both training and test set were summarized by means of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, specifically sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). Analyses were carried out using R (R Core Team) (32) through the graphical user interface RStudio (www. rstudio.com).",

Several transcriptional signatures based on testing in different ethnic populations have been proposed for this purpose by numerous research groups (14, 17, 21, 24, 35, 36) . However, limited overlap in genes differentially expressed between PTB and household controls have been found when comparing these signatures. A recent meta-analysis identified eight signatures with an equivalent performance that showed moderate to high correlation for diagnosing incipient TB. Overlapping constituent genes only partially accounted for correlation between signatures, suggesting that they reflect different dimensions of the typical host response to infection with Mtb, and strongly supported the identification of IFN and TNF signaling pathways as statistically enriched upstream regulators of the genes across the eight signatures (37) . Several attempts have been made to reduce the large number of genes identified by these studies as potentially relevant into smaller candidate signatures that could form the basis of a potential clinical diagnostic. However, there is still no agreement as to which genes to include in an optimal diagnostic signature.",

However, the 11-gene signature was less successful in efficiently discriminating TB disease from other lung diseases. The evaluation of this 11-gene signature in the UK-derived cohort indicated reasonable diagnostic accuracy (> 80.0, Table 3 ) for the identification of PTB. However, in the CTRC cohort, the performance of the 11-gene signature was lower. Aiming for a POC triage test to ascertain targeted referral of symptomatic subjects in the field, this shortcoming in accuracy can to some extent be overcome by clinical algorithms that include reassessment and referral of subjects with lack of improvement from assumed intercurrent infections (with or without antibiotics dependent on clinical presentation). The reasons for discrepancy between the two cohorts are likely multifactorial reflecting differences in ethnicity, sample size, mean age (in years) and lack of other lung disease controls in our cohort. The transcriptional signature identified in the present study meets WHO TTP minimal requirement for a screening test, but further evaluation will be required before clinical implementation is possible.",

This is despite the fact that the differentially expressed genes (whether down or up-regulated) showed the same trend in both pediatric and adult populations. Despite decades of research, significant investment, and numerous reports on new biomarker candidates, few biomarkers have been independently validated for both clinical trials and routine clinical use, and translated into new diagnostic tests (39, 40) .

A recent study hypothesized that a blood protein-based host response signature for active PTB could discriminate it from other TB-like disease (OTD) in adult patients with persistent cough and provide the foundation for a community-based triage test for PTB. The study identified a host blood protein signature consisting of IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and VEGF, that discriminated active PTB from OTD with an AUC of 0.80, corresponding to a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 65% (41) . The present study also identified a 4-protein signature (IFNg, GMCSF, IL15, and IL7) in TB-ag stimulated QFT supernatants that distinguishes PTB patients from their household controls with AUCs \u2265 0.87, providing proof of concept for a protein-based approach.",

To some extent, however, this limitation was offset by the use of multiple validation cohorts, as described; ii) Lack of validation in extra-pulmonary TB cases-a population in which non-sputum based diagnostics are strongly needed; iii) Inability to cross-validate the identified proteomic signature due to the lack of comparable samples from other cohorts. Although host-response-based diagnostics are believed to be less dependent on bacterial load, an obvious advantage for TB diagnosis, it is unclear if these tools can be further optimized to meet the WHO target for a universally applicable POC test. With the increasing number of blood-based signatures for TB diagnosis being proposed, it is crucial to pool data across cohorts' diverse in geographic, genetic, demographic and endemic characteristics in order to diminish time and costs for POC test evaluation with regard to the WHO TPP, and subsequent validation prior to translation to clinical practice.",

Similarly, the 11-gene signature differentiated PTB from Mtb-infected household contacts with an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89-0.98), with a specificity of 89.8% (95% CI, 77.0-96.2; Table 3A and Figure 2). Study 2: Thompson EG et al.; GSE89403 Adult Data Set The performance of the 11-gene signature was also evaluated in the GSE89403 data set (South African CTRC as validation set 3 and 4), where it gave an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87-0.99) correctly classifying 50 of 95 PTB cases (sensitivity 52.6%, 95% CI, 42.2-62.8), and 20 of 21 healthy controls (specificity 95.2%, 95% CI, 75.1-99.7). Interestingly, given the real-life diagnostic challenges faced in differentiating TB patients from other symptomatic patients, the 11-gene signature differentiated PTB from other lung diseases with an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56-0.89), with a specificity of 82.4% (95% CI, 55.8-95.3;Table 3AandFigure 3).",

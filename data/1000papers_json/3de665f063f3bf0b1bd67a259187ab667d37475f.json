The pharmacists' knowledge of research design and their ability to critically analyze the literature places them in an essential position to recommend and modify therapy based on the best supporting evidence. During the first days of the COVID-19 surge, critically-ill patients presented to our institution before any formal treatment recommendations were established. Therefore, our first critically-ill COVID-19 positive patients were initiated on a regimen consisting of chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir based on in-vitro and anecdotal data. 3, 4 That same week, Gautret and colleagues published their experiences utilizing a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, demonstrating a significant reduction of viral carriage compared to untreated patients. 5 The very next day, Cao and colleagues published a study highlighting the lack of benefit observed with lopinavir/ritonavir beyond standard of care. 6 By the end of the week, after our pharmacists presented this data during patient care rounds, all of our COVID-19 positive patients were transitioned to regimens consisting of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. We then continued to routinely utilize the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for all COVID-19 patients up until more robust evidence was published demonstrating a lack of clinical benefit and potential risk for harm with the two medications. 7, 8 Our current treatment for COVID-19 now consists mainly of supportive care and the occasional use of investigational therapy such as the anti-viral remdesivir or the interleukin-6 inhibitor tocilizumab. 9,10 Future treatment regimens are still liable to change given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, low-quality of existing literature and large number of ongoing studies. One of the most important things to take into consideration when deciding to implement additional treatment modalities in the era of social media is the underlying quality of evidence.",

As members of various hospital committees such as Pharmacy and Therapeutics, critical care, and antimicrobial stewardship, pharmacists are able to utilize their knowledge of the literature to play a direct role in the decision-making process for institutional treatment algorithms and therapy restrictions.

Despite the increased health risk, we continued to provide our critical care pharmacy services consisting of direct patient care rounds and response to inpatient emergencies. According to the Society of Critical Care Medicine, efforts must be taken to minimize exposure to healthcare workers and maximize the chances of success during endotracheal intubation by having the most experienced healthcare professional with airway management perform the procedure. 12 We believe this same principal should be extrapolated to inpatient cardiac arrests, with experienced pharmacists utilizing their knowledge of advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) and pharmacology to manage the medications during inpatient cardiac arrests. This principle is supported by previous data demonstrating decreased patient mortality when a pharmacist is integrated in the cardiopulmonary resuscitation team. 13 During the early weeks of the COVID-19 surge in New York City, our critical care pharmacist responded to approximately four cardiac arrests a day, fully gowning up and entering the room with the other members of the resuscitation team in an effort to reduce contamination to the rest of the unit and to play an active role in therapy management. By serving as the responder in charge of the medications, our pharmacy services were able to alleviate the strain of high nurse to patient ratios during these emergencies. In addition to cardiac arrests, pharmacists play a crucial role in rapid sequence intubation through facilitating the most appropriate selection and dosing of sedatives and paralytics. 14 During the COVID-19 surge, our department prepared custom rapid sequence intubation kits consisting of etomidate, propofol, and rocuronium to be stored in our automatic dispensing cabinets at an adequate quantity to ensure the medication would always be available in the event of simultaneous intubations.",

Pharmacists are well positioned to assist our nursing colleagues in this effort by having medication orders synchronized as much as possible without compromising on the efficacy of the therapy or safety of the patient. In our experience, certain critically-ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia would require high dose sedative and paralytic continuous infusions to maintain appropriate oxygen saturations. In order to meet this demand, pharmacists utilized their knowledge of drug compatibility and stability to create custom orders in the electronic medical record for providers that can hold larger volumes, effectively decreasing the number of bag changes performed by the nurse. A variety of investigational drug therapy has been initiated for the management of COVID-19 at our institution. Our infectious diseases clinical specialist was able to coordinate with our informatics team to facilitate the safe use of these agents through the development of order sets and custom orders in the electronic medical record.",

Our pharmacists in charge of procurement have worked diligently through coordinated efforts with our critical care and infectious diseases pharmacy specialists and pharmacy leadership to maintain an adequate supply of medications anticipated to be used frequently in the management of COVID-19 patients. These medications include but are not limited to anti-infective agents, neuromuscular blocking agents, non-benzodiazepine sedatives, analgesics, and vasopressors. Strategies to mitigate the risk of local drug shortages include frequently monitoring the institution's distribution center supply, reaching out to other institutions regarding their current purchase patterns, and dealing directly with generic manufacturers and their representatives. In addition to acquisition, pharmacists should also serve as key members in multi-disciplinary meetings with hospital leadership to develop a protocolized approach to treatment in an effort to conserve drug supply. For instance, our institution experienced a shortage of cisatracurium, a neuromuscular blocking agent commonly utilized to promote ventilator synchrony in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. 15 In accordance with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for managing critically ill patients with COVID-19, we encouraged providers to utilize bolus dosing of paralytics when able before committing to a continuous infusion while preparing guidelines to utilize rocuronium and vecuronium as alternatives. 12 In the event of a fentanyl shortage, our institution prepared a guideline outlining alternative treatment regimens, utilizing intermittent intravenous push-doses of longer-acting opioids such as hydromorphone.",

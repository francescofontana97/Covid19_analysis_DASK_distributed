This individualised protocol contains three cornerstones: an increase in dosage of prophylactic LMWH close to therapeutic doses, introduction of routine venous ultrasonography and daily measurements of plasma anti-factor Xa activity. First, we empirically augmented the prophylactic dose of nadroparin calcium to 3800 IU every 12 hours subcutaneously. A dose reduction based on clinical judgment was made for patients with severe kidney failure (eGFR < 30ml/min) and cachectic patients (total body weight<40kg). Second, all patients were screened two times per week for the presence of DVT in the large veins (i.e. the inferior caval vein, iliac, femoral, popliteal, jugular, subclavian and brachial veins) with duplex ultrasonography, regardless of clinical suspicion. This ultrasound technique uses a combination of a venous compression ultrasound and a venous Doppler ultrasound. By applying pressure, one can evaluate the collapsibility of the deep veins. When a vein is not fully collapsible, it indicates the presence of a blood clot. The collapsibility is tested every few cm. Pulsed wave Doppler is used to evaluate the presence and velocity of blood flows within the vein. This examination was consequently performed bedside by a radiologist rather than forming part of a general point-of-care ultrasound examination. Third, we in introduced daily measurement of anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) activity in all patients. The anti-Xa test is a functional assay, measuring the direct inhibition of factor Xa by any LMWH. Anti-Xa testing was performed with the ACL top 550 (Werfen\uf0d2). Blood samples were taken four to six hours after subcutaneous administration of LMWH.

Thus, D-dimers in fact are a symptom of development of COVID-induced hypercoagulopathy, i.e. the formation of arterial and venous thromboembolism 5 . Therefore, the association between high D-dimers and mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia may be attributed to massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and resulting obstructive shock 21 . This hypothesis is substantiated by recently published clinical reports on the incidence of thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients 22-25 . Klok et al found a 49% cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in a multicenter cohort of 184 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU 22 . All patients received at least standard doses of LMWH 22 . Helms et al. demonstrated a 43% prevalence of thrombotic complications in a French multicenter ICU study of 150 COVID-19 patients despite prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation 24 . Moreover, they confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients developed significantly more thrombotic complications compared to non-COVID ARDS patients 24 .

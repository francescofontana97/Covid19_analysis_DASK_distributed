As the programme is newly developed, only a few studies tried to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in qualitative approaches, or in quantitative approach with relatively small sample (e.g. n < 10). In the present study, our team, who is responsible for the implementation and evaluation of the WHO-CST programme in Hong Kong, attempt to assess the effectiveness of the training in WHO-CST under a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with about 120 eligible caregivers who will be randomly assigned in experimental and control groups. Our measurement will include the Joint Engagement Rating Inventory (JERI) developed by experts in WHO to gauge how parents engage their children in a 10-minute video recording their dyadic interaction and behaviors in a defined play setting. A set of other measurements on the caregiver's experience of using intervention skills and their enhancement of knowledges will also be measured. We hypothesize that caregivers in treatment group will have better growth in scores of both JERI and measurements of other outcome than the wait-list control group's after the 12-week WHO-CST training, and also persistence of skill and knowledge level should also be found after a 30-day follow-up test.",

Survey figures of diagnosed ASD cases have been raised worldwide in the last two decades. The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network estimated the prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years was 18.5 per 1,000 children in eleven selected states in America in 2016, while other recent reports from the ADDM network stated that in United States, the 4-year-old ASD prevalence and the 8-year-old ASD prevalence were 13.4 per 1,000 (Christensen et al., 2016) , and 16.8 per 1,000, respectively (Baio et al., 2018) . These figures have been doubled when compared to those reported in the past 10 years (i.e., 6.7 per 1000) (Baio et al., 2018) . A recent meta-analysis in 2020 found that the pooled estimate of ASD prevalence was 0.36% in nine selected Asian countries3 which was much higher than that in similar analysis in 2010 (0.15%) (Qiu et al., 2020) , and the pooled estimate of ASD prevalence in mainland China was about 0.39% in a meta-analysis at 2018 (Wang et al., 2018) .",

Therefore, at the time being for parents who suspects that their children may have ASD are waiting for receiving formal diagnosis, pre-assessment intervention can be offered to enhance their caregiving skill and knowledge on handling situation of ASD children. Services or interventions which allow parents to communicate with professionals and other parents having similar caregiving experience can also moderate their anxiety, since social support and teaching parents to have positive perception can ameliorate mental and relational well-being among parents of children having ASD (Koegel, Koegel, Ashbaugh& Bradshaw, 2014; Wong, Mak, Liao, 2016) . Well organized preassessment service can also be associated with a reduced duration of diagnostic process for children. Offering adequate and relevant information in pre-assessment period can be likely to reduce total duration of the assessment process (McKenzie, 2015) . Recent review on services prepared for ASD children also suggested that provision of pre-assessment information workshops and earlier intervention to parents can reduce their anxiety and let them become more well-prepared for formal diagnosis and services (Ho, Yi, Griffiths, & Murray,2020) .",

Participated caregiver-child dyads will be randomized to the intervention or to a wait list at 1:1 ratio: 60 caregiver-child dyads will be randomly assigned to a treatment group to receive WHO-CST training whereas another 60 caregiver-child dyads will be randomly assigned to a wait-list-control condition.

For the variables which presented as continuous or count data, the between group mean differences, the standard deviation, the range and the possible range (as provided in the instrument), at different time points of assessment will be reported. Given the intent-to-treat design, all caregiverchildren dyads' data will be contained in the original assignment group, including those who dropped out before the end of the study, and all will take the assessment at any of the three timepoints as possible. All the outcome measurements with continuous variables (i.e., JERI, GHQ12, ECBI, etc.) will be analyzed using linear mixed models (LMM) with random intercept and slope parameters, where appropriate, examining the effect of treatment assignment (treatment group versus wait-list-control group), time points of assessment (T1, T2 and T3), and their interaction on outcome. The reason of using the LMM is because of its full-information loaded characteristic which can involve information from all randomized (intent-to-treat) participants, including those with only partial data owing to drop-out or other reasons (Unnebrink & Windeler, 2001) . LMM are advantageous compared to repeated measures ANCOVA in that they accommodate data of missing time points, hence utilize all available data, and therefore can be considered in our intent-to-treat models. One's latest assessments before dropout or completion of the programme will be used in the model. The assessment at T2 and its interaction with group and time are the primary interest to test our hypotheses. The LMM analysis will be performed by R package lme4 and glmmTMB.",

The team was funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust and wholly managed under the Faculty of Social Sciences, the University of Hong Kong, and the programmes launched were co-operated with several NGOs in Hong Kong (i.e., Caritas-HK, Heep Hong Society, and SAHK). A few small-scale evaluative studies have been conducted to examine the efficacy of different programmes, and these studies showed small within-group effect sizes on the reductions in child's problematic behaviours, parenting stress, as well as on the improvements of perceived social support, parenting competence and mental health (Cohen's d ranged 0.11-0.22; 226 families). While the Team appreciated the creativity and commitment of the NGOs in designing innovative strategies to address the needs of families of children with ASD, the nonstandardized programme implementation and non-comparable evaluation design resulted in difficulties on assessing the successfulness of the programmes and failed to inform any measures on improving these set of programmes. Under consideration of these defaults, at the beginning of 2019, the Team began to adapt a standardized training programme titled \"World Health Organization -Caregiver Skills Training\" (WHO-CST) in Hong Kong, which was co-created and recommended by WHO and Autism Speaks. Eight major NGOs (Caritas Hong Kong, Heep Hong Society, SAHK, the Salvatory Army, the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui Welfare Council, YWCA, and the New Life) which have provided services for children with ASD also joined the project and implemented the WHO-CST program in various districts of Hong Kong under the coordination of the Team.",

            "text": "A mainstay of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic is the N95 filtering facepiece respirator. N95 respirators are commonly used to protect healthcare workers from respiratory pathogens, including the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and are increasingly employed by other frontline workers and the general public. Under routine circumstances, these masks are disposable, single-use items, but extended use and reuse practices have been broadly enacted to alleviate critical supply shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. While extended-time single use presents a low risk of pathogen transfer, repeated donning and doffing of potentially contaminated masks presents increased risk of pathogen transfer. Therefore, efficient and safe decontamination methods for N95 masks are needed to reduce the risk of reuse and mitigate local supply shortages. Here we review the available literature concerning use of germicidal ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light to decontaminate N95 masks. We propose a practical method for repeated point-of-use decontamination using commercially-available UV-C crosslinker boxes from molecular biology laboratories to expose each side of the mask to 800-1200 mJ/cm 2 of UV-C. We measure the dose that penetrated to the interior of the respirators and model the potential germicidal action on coronaviruses. Our experimental results, in combination with modeled data, suggest that a two-minute UV-C treatment cycle should induce a >3-log-order reduction in viral bioburden on the surface of the respirators, and a 2-log order reduction throughout the interior. We find that a dose 50-fold greater does not impair filtration or fit of 3M 8210 N95 masks, indicating that decontamination can be performed repeatedly. As such, UV-C germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is a practical strategy for small-scale point-of-use decontamination of N95s.",

Respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 can potentially be transmitted through contact, respiratory droplets, and aerosols. WHO recommends droplet and contact precautions for people caring for COVID-19 patients and recommends airborne precautions, such as N95 masks, for circumstances where SARS-CoV-2 aerosol particles are generated (2) N95 masks are filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) that have at least 95% efficiency for filtering airborne particles (size around 300 nm) and meet the air filtration rating of the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) classification for filtering respirators. Equivalent standards of N95 are FFP2 (European Union), KN95 (China), DS/DL2 (Japan), and KF94 (South Korea) (3) . N95 filtering facepiece respirators for use by the general public in public health medical emergencies are intended for over-the-counter use (4) . A model for a hypothetical influenza pandemic in the US suggested that several billion N95 masks would be required to prevent widespread transmission among the public, which would lead to severe supply shortages (5) . Current guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest limiting the use of N95 masks to healthcare personnel, while providing low-tech face masks for the general public (6) .",

            "text": "There are challenges in maintaining the physical and electrostatic properties of N95 masks after certain decontamination methods. The multi-layer sandwich structure of N95 masks, like the 3M model 8210 (Figure 1 ), consists of an outer layer (Coverweb) which faces the environment, middle layers (Filters 1 and 2), and an inner layer (Shell) which faces the user (10) . The 3M 8210 mask materials are polyester for the Coverweb and Shell, polypropylene for Filters 1 and 2, thermoplastic elastomer for the straps, aluminum for the nose clip, and polyurethane for the nose foam. Filters 1 and 2 are the internal filtering medium (IFM), the key material of the N95 mask. The IFM is a proprietary Brownian filtration media which traps particles that collide with a specially treated surface, which is made of electrostatically charged meltblown polypropylene microfibers. These microfibers have cross-sectional diameters in the range of 2 to 10 \u03bcm and cross each other to form a 3D porous structure, with up to 90% porosity (3) . The microfibers are electrostatically charged to attract and trap particles and increase filtration efficiency without impeding air flow (11) . Decontamination methods with 75% alcohol or a chlorine-based solution dramatically reduce the filtration performance of N95 masks, likely due to breakdown of the electrostatic charge on the filter material, and are not recommended (3) . On the other hand, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been shown to efficiently inactivate pandemic influenza virus applied as aerosols or droplets on several different N95 masks (12) (13) (14) .",

We demonstrate that UV germicidal irradiation represents a powerful tool for small-scale decontamination of N95 masks.

We show that N95 decontamination can be achieved with commercially-available UV crosslinker devices commonly found in molecular biology laboratories. Similar low-cost UV boxes designed for point-of-use N95 mask decontamination could be rapidly produced and distributed worldwide to alleviate local critical shortages of N95 masks, such as during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",

The transmittances are 15%, 27%, 21% and 0.11% for the Coverweb, Filter 1, Filter 2 and Shell, respectively. The limitation of Setup 2 is that the sample and the digital radiometer have to be placed into the UVP CL-1000 photocrosslinker before the UV light can be turned on which makes it difficult to measure fluctuations of the intensity. In Setup 3, we used the UVP Compact UV lamp, enabling us to perform repeated measurements with and without samples to determine the transmittance based on the radiometer readings. The calculated transmittances were 22% (16 to 29), 21% (16 to 26), 14% (9 to 20) and 0% (0 to 5) for the Coverweb, Filter 1, Filter 2 and Shell, respectively. Since the irradiance of the Compact UV lamp was lower as compared to the CL-1000, the transmitted light was too low to give any readings different from zero on the radiometer. To determine the transmittance of the Shell layer material, we resorted to a densitometric approach using photochromic UV-C indicator stickers. Germicidal UV sources. The 254-nm line of the mercury-vapor emission spectrum is the predominant line of a low-pressure mercury-vapor lamp manufactured with a soda-lime glass bulb, which absorbs the 184-nm line. The 254-nm UV-C light efficiently inactivates singlestranded RNA viruses as seen in the germicidal action spectrum (Figure 3c ) (19) . The action spectrum is for the MS2 bacteriophage, which is a positive strand RNA virus, similar to the coronaviruses of interest. The shape of the germicidal action spectrum should be independent of the particular virus, but instead should depend on the underlying photochemistry of the UV damage of the RNA genome. Recently, germicidal UV light emitting diodes (LEDs) became commercially available that emit in the 260 to 280 nm range.",

Moreover, the UV-C dose-dependent inactivation of viruses is known to deviate from a simple first-order decay model (23) . In absence of detailed data on the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, we use literature data for the closely related virus SARS-CoV (20) , as the UV-C sensitivity of related viruses is roughly constant after accounting for genome size (24) . Figure 4 shows a semi-logarithmic plot of the dose-dependent inactivation of SARS-CoV measured by Kariwa et al. (20, 21) . The endpoint dilution assay quantifies the virus titer by serially diluting the treated virus stock, inoculating Vero E6 cells with the serial dilutions, observing the cytopathic effect under a microscope after 48 hours incubation to quantify the percentage of cell death, and calculating the fifty-percent tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ). We model the data as a double-exponential decay function that enables interpolation of the data points in a meaningful manner. The fast component is 98.6%\u00b10.4% and has a UV-C sensitivity of 0.522\u00b10.040 cm 2 /mJ. The slow component is 1.4%\u00b10.4% and has a sensitivity of 0.066\u00b10.003 cm 2 /mJ. The occurrence of a slow component of UV-resistant virus is unexpected. Exponential survival curves can be explained by a single hit to kill model (25) . Lytle and Sagripanti compare the UV-C sensitivities of a large number of different virus families and state that only the Herpesviridae family consistently exhibits two-component survival curves (24) . Therefore, it is likely that the double-exponential decay function necessary to fit the Kariwa et al. data reflects an experimental issue. We interpret the slow component as virus trapped at the bottom of the sample and the fast component as freely diffusing virus particles. If so, the fast rate constant would represent the averaged depth dependent UV-C dosage scaled by the sensitivity of the virus. The slow component would result from the attenuated UV-C dosage reaching the bottom, caused by the inner-filter effects of the tissue culture media used in the experiments (see the Discussion section). The final plateau with a value of 17\u00b12 TCID 50 /mL value, which corresponds to a fraction of 5\u00d710 -7 , corresponds to the detection limit of the assay, which is likely due to cytopathic effects of protein components of the virions that are not inactivated by the UV-C irradiation, since the assay in principle does not discriminate cytopathic effects from true infectivity as other assays.",

We model the depth-dependent cumulative absorbance of all layers as a piece-wise linear function corresponding to the sum of the absorbances, with one function from each side. These depth-dependent absorbance functions allow calculation of the depth-dependent transmittance, and therefore the local UV-C dosage. Figure 5A shows a semi-logarithmic plot with three curves corresponding to the local UV-C dosage as a function of the relative position in the four layers of the N95 mask (Shell, Filter 2, Filter 1, and Coverweb) for three cases of illumination. The first case is illumination from the inside surface of the mask. The orange curve shows the local dosage for illumination from the user-facing inside of the mask with a surface UV-C dosage of 1000 mJ/cm 2 . Due to the high absorbance of the polyester material of the Shell layer, the local dosage rapidly drops to 2 mJ/cm 2 at the interface between the layers Shell and Filter 2. It further drops to 0.29 mJ/cm 2 at the interface between Filter 2 and Filter 1, and 0.06 mJ/cm 2 at the interface between Filter 1 and Coverweb. The residual local dosage at the exit on the other side of the mask is only 0.014 mJ/cm 2 . The second case is illumination from the outside surface of the mask. The green curve shows the local dosage for illumination from the environment-facing outside of the mask with a surface UV-C dosage of 1000 mJ/cm 2 . The dosage drops to 220 mJ/cm 2 at the interface between Coverweb and Filter 1, to 46 mJ/cm 2 at the interface between Filter 1 and Filter 2, and to 6.5 mJ/cm 2 at the interface between Filter 2 and Shell. The exit dosage at the inside surface is 0.014 mJ/cm 2 . The third case is for illumination from both sides of the mask. The black curve shows the local dosage for illumination from both sides of the mask with a surface UV-C dosage of 1000 mJ/cm 2 , each. The local dosage is 8.6 mJ/cm 2 at the Shell to Filter 2 interface, 46 mJ/cm 2 at the Filter 2 to Filter 1 interface, and 220 mJ/cm 2 at the Filter 1 to Coverweb interface.

The local UV-C dosage calculated for the three cases of illumination together with the UV-C dose-dependent inactivation of SARS-CoV enables an estimate of the local residual virus viability in an irradiated N95 mask ( Figure 5B ). The orange curve is for the first case with illumination from the inside surface of the mask. The first half of the Shell layer is efficiently decontaminated with 0.07% local viability in the center of the Shell. However, the sharp rise of the local viability to 34% at the interface of Shell and Filter 2 shows that the illumination from the inside of the mask is insufficient to decontaminate the highly porous material of the Shell layer. Note that the optically dense Shell layer has a thickness of 0.90 mm, which is almost as much as the combined thickness of all other layers (Filter 2 is 0.41 mm, Filter 1 is 0.36 mm and Coverweb is 0.20 mm thick). In contrast, the green curve, for the second case where the mask is illuminated from the outside, shows efficient decontamination of the three layers, Coverweb, Filter 1 and Filter 2, with 4.3% local viability at the interface of Filter 2 and Shell, but little or no decontamination of the Shell. For the third case with illumination from both sides, the local viability throughout the mask is very low. The smallest UV-C dosage inside the core of the Shell material results in 3% local virus viability. The integrated local viability yields the averaged virus viability in the mask, which is 0.3% for illumination from each side together of the mask with 1000 mJ/cm 2 surface dosage.",

The only study that used aerosolized adenovirus and influenza virus found levels of permeability comparable with the results from the MS2 model virus, even though the MS2 virion (27.5 nm diameter) is smaller than influenza virus (80 to 120 nm diameter) or SARS-CoV-2 (50 to 200 nm diameter) (35) .

It is also possible that virus could be re-aerosolized from the mask due to the airflow from breathing, coughing or sneezing. A study of simulated coughing through an N95 mask contaminated with the MS2 virus demonstrated that only a small percentage of virus was released (38) . However, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present at high levels in large particle aerosols in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak, which raises concerns that larger particles are more efficiently re-aerosolized under similar conditions (36, 39) . Our results demonstrate that inner layers of the N95 mask will inevitably receive different amounts of dosage than outer layers.

The absorbance is about 2.66\u00b10.04 per 1-cm pathlength with about 58% contribution from FBS and the rest from DMEM. Therefore, even shallow layers of virus suspension will have a high absorbance that results in substantial inner filter effects that reduce the available UV-C dosage in a depth-dependent fashion.

The RNA genome size of the different coronaviruses (MHV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) is very similar (44, 45) , and, therefore, they should have intrinsically similar UV-C sensitivities (22, 24, 40) . The differences of UV-C sensitivities are likely due to the different form, aerosol versus shallow solution. Since the small diameter of the aerosol droplets will have negligible inner filter effects, UV-C sensitivities measured in aerosol is most applicable, although to perform these experiments on additional viral species is prohibitive due to requisite biosafety measures.",

Future work could employ this technique to assess the ability of UV-C to affect viability of SARS-CoV-2. However, this method of measuring bioburden reduction has a key limitation; the static application of the virus to the respirator surface does not accurately model the penetration of aerosolized virus deeper into the respirator. While virus on the surface likely poses the greatest hazard to the user and others, one study using the MS2 bacteriophage as a model has shown that a small percentage of viable virus can be re-aerosolized from an N95 respirator.

The photodegradation of polypropylene filaments by UV-C irradiation has been studied with mechanical strength tests and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which has demonstrated the formation of alcohols, peroxides, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and anhydride reaction products (52, 53) . The initiation of photo-oxidation reaction cascades of polypropylene, especially at wavelengths longer than 290 nm, is thought to originate from chromophoric groups, such as hydroperoxides, which in turn are formed in an autocatalytic process (54) . The photodegradation of the polyester poly(ethylene terephthalate) involves photo-oxidative reactions leading to chain scission and the generation of carboxyl end groups (55, 56) . The photodegradation of polypropylene and polyester both rely on photo-oxidative reactions involving reactive oxygen species (ROS).",

            "text": "Several studies have previously examined the effect of UV-C irradiation on N95 respirator filtration and fit. However, their findings vary widely. According to Lindsley et al., for four tested N95 models, the mechanical strength of one or more layers was significantly reduced at exposure doses higher than 120000 mJ/cm 2 sequentially applied to each side (57) . The researchers observed only minor changes in particle penetration and flow resistance as a result, suggesting that a mask could safely endure 120 decontamination cycles of 1000 mJ/cm 2 (the CDC-recommended standard). However, this study only looked at filtration efficiency, rather than quantitative fit factor, which is inversely proportional to the total inward leakage of particles through a worn respirator. Fit factor therefore measures overall respirator performance, including both filtration efficiency and fit to the user's face. Smith et al. found that the fit factor of masks was reduced (albeit not below the minimum standard for N95s) after a dose of 18000 mJ/cm 2 via a germicidal lamp in a biosafety cabinet, corresponding to only 18 such cycles (58) . We note that Smith et al. used different models of N95 masks (1860, Aura 1870+, industrial 8511) manufactured by 3M, although no data were provided investigating differential effects of UV-C for each model. Another study of the effect of UV-C irradiation on the fit test performance of N95 masks did not have data for the 3M 8210 mask due to the current supply shortage (59) . They found that fit factor began to decrease even before 10 decontamination cycles, but the UV-C dose received by the mask was not specified, similar to a report by Fischer et al. (20) .",

Before and after each cycle, the masks were donned by a volunteer, and the quantitative fit factor was measured using a TSI PortaCount Pro Plus. The quantitative fit factor is defined as the ratio of concentrations of 0.02-1 \u00b5m particles outside and inside the mask, and is decreased both by particle penetration and poor fit. For N95 masks and other disposable respirators, the PortaCount Pro can measure a maximum fit factor of 200 (which would correspond to the mask filtering at least 99.5% of particles). One mask was subjected to fourteen exposure cycles (5000 mJ/cm 2 per cycle per side), and the other to one long exposure (20000 mJ /cm 2 exposure doses per side) followed by six shorter cycles (10000 mJ/cm 2 per side) giving 80000 mJ/cm 2 total dosage per side. Both tested masks maintained a fit factor of 200 during both normal breathing and deep breathing throughout for exposures up to 50000 mJ/cm 2 total dosage per side, which would correspond to fifty decontamination cycles with 1000 mJ/cm 2 each per side. We caution that this result is likely dependent on the model of N95 used, which may contribute to the inconsistency of results obtained from the literature. The company 3M has recently posted a technical bulletin on the impact of decontamination methods on selected N95 mask models from their program, including the 3M 8210 model we used in our experiments. They evaluated five UV-C decontamination systems and found that all of them pass the filtration efficiency and fit tests for five or more reprocessing cycles with exposure dosages of \u2265 1000 mJ/cm 2 on each side, and in one case up to a cumulative lifetime exposure of 100000 mJ/cm 2 (60) . Further testing is needed on other N95 models to determine the number of decontamination cycles that they can withstand without compromise.",

The odor originates from the UV-C irradiated mask itself and not any residues from wearing the mask, since a never-worn, new mask gives the same result. The odor is weak and dissipates rapidly, but nevertheless might reduce the acceptance of the UV-C decontamination of N95 masks for sensitive individuals. We also irradiated a N95 mask in a nitrogen atmosphere to test the role of ROS in the odor formation during photodegradation of the N95 mask. As compared with a mask irradiated in air, the nitrogen atmosphere dramatically reduced the subjective odor formation. While the ROS exposure might aid with virus inactivation, the UVC radiation alone should be sufficient for mask decontamination. Nitrogen can easily be purified from air by filtration, and it could be used for UV-C decontamination equipment to reduce to odor formation and thereby improve the user acceptance of the decontaminated masks. Others have described nutty/smoky odor of masks after UV-C decontamination and recommended to allow for off-gassing time when feasible (48) . Odor has been reported for moist heat decontamination methods as well (61) .",

Epidemiological reports indicate that the number of infectious disease outbreaks tripled between 1980 and 2010 (62), indicating a high likelihood of future moments of acute need for PPE such as N95 masks. It is difficult to prepare or stockpile N95 masks supplies in anticipation of this, given that current models of N95s can have a shelf life of 5 years, and decrease in effectiveness after their manufacturer-designated expiration date (7, 8) . Furthermore, challenges in increasing N95 production may not allow demand to be reached quickly enough during critical early moments of the spread of a disease and suggests that emergency N95 reuse is a necessary option to maintain. We note that two months after initial shortages of N95s due to COVID-19, demand has still not been met for health care workers treating infected individuals (63) . Therefore, we suggest that decontamination methods, such as UVGI of N95 masks, be considered as a feature of preparedness for times of acute need of PPE.",

The authors report a decay time constant for single exponential decay function fit of the normalized viral viability of wet virus over time. From the reported inactivation time constant of 1.0 +/-0.1 s and the UV-C power density of 0.849 mW/cm 2 , we calculate the corresponding to a UV-C sensitivity of 1.18 +/-0.12 cm 2 /mJ). However, we found by inspection and re-fitting of their tabulated data that about how much of the virus must have been inactivated at shorter exposure times before their first time point. Moreover, the limited amounts of infectious particles used for each experiment does not allow detection of more highly UV-C resistant fractions. Overall, the data from the Storm et al. paper present an advance since the authors were able to obtain results for SARS-CoV-2 in a BSL-4 laboratory, and they avoided the above-mentioned issues with inner filter effects of the protein-rich tissue culture media by using very small droplet volumes (5 \u03bcL). We calculate the UV-C dosage of 5.9 or 11.7 mJ/cm 2 needed to achieve 3-Log or 6-Log order, respectively, of virus inactivation from this new value for the UV-C sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2. Bianco et al. reported in a preprint that UV-C dosage of 3.7 mJ/cm2 was sufficient to achieve a 3-log order inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 suspended in tissue culture media in a 1-mm thick layer (65), but their data lack the information at low UV-C dosages necessary to calculate the UV-C sensitivity.",

Sears et al. modeled the effects of uneven UV-C exposure of masks from two sides due to mask curvature and they J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f suggest the use of multidirectional UV-C irradiation to improve decontamination (76) . Lilge et al. determined the optical scattering and absorbance coefficients of several N95 mask materials using diffuse transmission and reflection measurements with an integrating sphere and an array spectrophotometer, and they used these parameters for Monte Carlo modeling the light distribution within the layers of the mask (70) . Their modeling of the single-sided light distribution within the 3M 8210 mask suggests about four-log order reduction from the surface light fluence. The integrating sphere data now allow us to extend our own modeling to include the effects of UV-C reflectivity between layers of the N95 mask. Figure 7 shows the results of the model described in the Appendix. The model suggests that an exposure dosage with 1000 mJ/cm 2 from both sides of the mask, the minimum internal local dosage will be 28 mJ/cm 2 , which is sufficient to yield better than Log-6 inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 based on the data from Storm et al. Notably, this minimal local dosage calculated from the model including reflections is four-fold higher as compared to the model presented in Figure 5 , despite using the same experimental values of the transparency for each layer.",

Golovkine et al. performed a similar study using SARS-CoV-2, and for the 3M 1860 respirator, obtained similar results: a dose ranging from 900-1620 mJ/cm 2 on different areas of the mask achieved a 3.7 log-order reduction of virus on the mask surface. However, they found that the same does achieved only a 1.7-log-order reduction on a 3M 8210 mask (68) . Ozog et al. performed a similar study on five different N95 respirators, including both the 3M 1860 and 3M 8210; similarly, they found that a 1.5 J/cm 2 of exposure per side reduced SARS-CoV-2 bioburden on the 3M 1860 facepiece below the limit of detection, but failed to do so on the 3M 8210 facepiece (81) . They suggest that mask materials with hydrophilic properties, such as the 3M 8210, may have absorbed the virus applied to the surface deeper within the mask, and therefore the mask shielded some virus from UV-C radiation.",

Viral viability was measured after decontamination, and fit as a function of UV-C dose to a single exponential curve (73) . However, inspection of their data reveals that the time resolution of their experiment is insufficient to resolve the UV-C dosedependent inactivation kinetics. Moreover, the 3M 8211 N95 mask they used has a release valve, which is generally considered an exclusion criterion for use of UV-C decontamination. Using a similar method, Ludwig-Begall et al. found that doses of 2.6 J/cm 2 and 5.2 J/cm 2 , applied to a surgical mask and a KN95 respirator, respectively, yielded a >3 log-order reduction in viable porcine respiratory coronavirus. (71) This result suggests that UVGI is broadly effective to decontaminate disposable masks and respirators, but further work is needed to ensure that filtration is unaffected and to determine if the standard dose of 1 J/cm 2 is sufficient for decontamination.",

The highest level is recommended for decontamination of surgical masks for single-or multiple-users and includes a 6-log reduction of highly resistant bacterial spores. The second tier is intended for single-users only and specifies a 6-log order reduction of non-enveloped viruses or vegetative bacteria. The third tier recommends 3-log order reduction of non-enveloped virus or vegetative bacteria, and it is intended for single-users only to supplement existing CDC reuse recommendations. One of the key problems with these guidelines is that they do not specify how the bioburden reduction should be measured, in particular, where in the mask should the test be performed. Is it sufficient to obtain the desired reduction for a test sample applied to the surface of the mask, or is the same degree of reduction required for a sampled applied to any of the internal layers of the multilayer structure of the N95 mask? We noted that the user-facing Shell layer of the 3M 8210 mask is most problematic due to its high degree of UV-C absorption. In a single-user setting, the main aim is to decontaminate any virus that became trapped in the middle layers of the mask during use.",

We also describe the use a UV crosslinker box commonly found in molecular biology laboratories as a practical, point-of-use method for small-scale rapid UV-C decontamination of N95 masks. Such devices assure that a consistent dose of UV-C is applied to the masks, enabling reliable decontamination and repeated reuse without substantial mask photodegradation. Mass production of similar custom low-cost devices could be a cost-effective way of empowering frontline workers, and potentially the general public, to decontaminate masks even if they lack access to a large hospital-based decontamination facility.",

Imprudent online posts distort the posters' digital identity, which refers to one's online image as perceived by others. Online attentionseeking behaviour may result in digital identities that are separate from a person's true nature, which can lead to social and mental harm. To mitigate these impacts, effective educational material is needed to help non-technical users understand the risks and consequences of thoughtless, attention-seeking online behaviour. This study takes the first step towards fulfilling this educational need by developing the Online Attention Game (OAG), which is played in a laboratory or classroom setting (OAG-CS) or remotely (OAG-R). It replicates the online competition involved in seeking other social media users' attention. Through five OAG games (two OAG-CS games with students, two OAG-CS games with researchers, and one OAG-R game with researchers), we confirmed the tendencies and characteristics of young university students' and adult researchers' online posting behaviour. Through carrying out the OAG-R successfully, we ensured the OAG was useful for digital identity education even at the difficult time of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In recent years, such ill-considered posts have made headlines. In Japan, Twitter has been called a \"fool detector\" owing to the silly nature of many of the posts that appear on the platform. Without considering the consequences of what they post, some users attempt to attract attention by posting in-group jokes. They assume that their posts will only be viewed by friends and will soon be forgotten by other viewers after grabbing the spotlight due to the constant deluge of online posts. However, this assumption is not necessarily true as a social media post can remain accessible to any user for a long period of time. While it can attract positive attention from fellow followers, it can also trigger condemnation from unknown viewers. Imprudent online posts may distort the posters' digital identity, one's online image as perceived by others, which could lead others to perceive them as divorced from their true self due to their attention-seeking behaviour. This can have harmful effects on the social lives and mental health of young social media users [1] [2] [3] .",

Given the current environment in which young people use social media as an essential tool for communication and socialisation, there is an urgent need for quality education with regard to moral guidelines for behaviour, the realities of social media architecture, and the business models that incentivise attentionseeking behaviour online. However, such educational materials have only been developed to a limited extent. Neither qualitative nor quantitative studies have been sufficiently conducted due to a lack of understanding of young people's attitudes and behaviours surrounding online attention-seeking behaviour.",

Their approach to communication has been significantly affected by an online business model that encourages users to provide information about themselves, and their friends and acquaintances, to turn a profit [1, 4] . This can lead young users to seek self-esteem and gain recognition from fellow social media users by competing for their attention, often unconsciously. Empirical investigations into how social media usage influences young people's online behaviours and communication styles, drawing a parallel to mental maturity and social development, have not yet effectively been carried out.",

The OAG is an online game that simulates or replicates the competition involved in seeking others' attention on social media either in a laboratory or classroom setting (OAG-CS) or remotely (OAG-R). Using the OAG and analysing its outcomes, we examined players' awareness of, and behaviour towards, online competitions during and after the game, as well as the influence of other players' actions during the game. To distinguish the distinctive characteristics of young users, the OAG-CS was played by both young people (university students) and adults (researchers) on two separate occasions. Meanwhile, the OAG-R was played by adults once to examine differences in players' attention seeking behaviours and feelings between the two types of game settings.",

In Sect. 2, we outline and discuss the card-based attention game on which OAG is based. In Sect. 3, we deal with the features of OAG, how it is played, and players' self-reflection of it. In Sect. 4, we show the overview of the OAG experiments. In Sect. 5, we analyse the difference between students and researchers in posting and evaluation behaviour. In Sect. 6, we consider the researchers behaviour in onsite and remote environments. Finally, we present our conclusions in Sect. 7.",

First, a player chooses the same headline in both polls (Type 1). This implies that the player believes a specific headline posted by another player will win the most attention of participants, including themselves. Second, a player chooses their own headline in the Keynesian beauty contest (Type 2). This is the behaviour of a player who has confidence in . This behaviour indicates that the player thinks other people will make decisions different from their own. The results of these behavioural types are shown in Table 4 . For both students and researchers, Type 3 behaviour was adopted most often. This suggests that many players tended to believe that their perception of the attractiveness of headlines was different from that of others. Assurance of anonymity during a game may have supported this behaviour. There might be players who, if permitted, would have voted for their own headlines in the My Choice voting. However, given that Type 2 behaviour was exhibited only occasionally by both students and researchers, there would be few players engaging in self-voting. Tables 5 and 6 show the reasons for participants' votes when Type 1 behaviour was adopted by students and researchers, respectively. When students engaged in Type 1 behaviour, they tended to place emphasis on headlines matching their interests, compared to other options in the My Choice voting. On the other hand, when researchers adopted such behaviour, they tended to consider whether headlines provided them with useful information. Researchers also placed importance on the usefulness of headlines as sources of information in the Keynesian beauty contest, which is unsurprising given the nature of their professional work. Table 7 shows the distribution of the reasons for players' votes in the Keynesian beauty contest when participants engaged in Type 2 behaviour. When voting on postings in the My Choice voting, approximately 70% of students, and researchers, believed that headlines they voted for in the Keynesian beauty contest were useful information to many people or matched many people's interests. This may imply that both students and researchers tended to consider that headlines that invoke sympathy in many would attract much attention and their own headlines exactly do. The ratio of students who believed \"unexpected/interesting\" postings attracted attention from many people, when engaged in Type 2 behaviour, was higher than that of researchers. This may indicate that, when taking on Type 2 behaviour, students, more so than researchers, tended to expect that headlines which stimulated people's potential interests would attract attention. Tables 8 and 9 show the reasons for participants' votes when engaging in Type 3 behaviour. When engaging in such behaviour, students tended to believe that headlines useful to many people would attract the most attention, followed by those which matched many people's interests. However, they chose headlines as their favourite ones, which contained useful information to them, were unexpected/interesting for them, and matched their own interests in about equal proportion.",

This can be interpreted in two ways. First, students might have experienced or heard about, for example, personal data misuse among adolescents on the Internet. This may have given them an understanding, or at least a vague notion, of the risks associated with thoughtless online postings. Another possibility might be that, due to immaturity, they did not realise that their posts could be interpreted differently than they intended, leading to a distorted online persona. As an example of how individual perceptions of postings can vary, during an OAG trial conducted at a university (not included in this study), a player posted a headline with a sexual expression and rated themselves as a \"funny person\" in the self-reflection stage, although some other players could interpret it unpleasantly. A large number of student participants in the same trial posted inappropriate headlines containing individual names and personal information in contravention of the OAG rules, indicating their possible unrelenting compulsion to stand out. After students were reminded not to deviate from the rules, such postings disappeared in succeeding rounds [11] . The size of the participant population may likely relate to the frequency of inappropriate postings. Table 11 shows the perceived influence of other players' posting behaviour on participants' own postings based on responses to Q3. Note that participants in R1 did not answer this question. The majority of both students and researchers considered their postings to be influenced to a certain extent by the posting behaviour of others. More than nine out of ten students and seven out of ten researchers ranked the influence of posts made by others as \"much\" or \"to a certain extent.\" It could be interpreted that students were more sensitive than researchers to other postings. This may be due to young people being eager to draw attention from others, wanting to win a game in any way, or being compelled to engage in favourable online behaviour knowing that they're being watched by unspecified others. Table 12 shows participants' perceptions of their reactions to other players' headlines attracting the attention of others. Around 30% of students decided to post headlines which stood out more, and another 30% were determined to create more emotional headlines. On the other hand, less than 30% of researchers attempted to develop eye-grabbing headlines. However, both students and researchers were relatively unmotivated to make their headlines more useful for response to other attractive headlines. A quarter of researchers answered that they did not change their approach to creating headlines, whereas around 10% of students replied that they did, demonstrating their tendency to easily be affected by other people's behaviour. Taking the findings about self-expression and perceived influence of others' posting behaviour into account, this may mean that students, perhaps unconsciously, were sensitive to the atmosphere in the OAG-CS setting.",

The usefulness of a headline for many people was the reason for 30% of the votes held by participants in the OAG-R, and for over 40% of the votes cast by adult participants in the OAG-CS. Among the votes, 31% during the OAG-R and 25% during the OAG-CS, were cast based on the belief that the headlines matched many people's interests. The slight differences in the ratios between the two types of OAGs could be due to game R3 having been played on 25 July 2020, when COVID-19 was spreading. In fact, 40% of the headlines created by players during the game were associated with coronaviruses, COVID-19, or telework. Players might have considered these headlines to match many players' interests at the time.

This also could be due to the date when the game was played remotely. Many participants posted headlines related to COVID-19 during the game, which might be \"interesting\" from the researcher's perspective, but not \"useful\". Table 15 shows the distribution of three types of voting behaviour engaged in by the adult researchers during the OAG-CS (R1 and R2) and OAG-R (R3). It seems that the game environment did not significantly affect an adult participant's adoption of a behavioural type. The reasons for participants' votes when Type 1 behaviour was adopted by researchers during the OAG-CS (onsite: R1 and R2) and OAG-R (remote: R3) are shown in Table 16 .

During the remote game, they emphasised headlines that matched many people's interests or were unexpected/interesting for many people. In the My Choice voting, the same headlines being voted for in the Keynesian beauty contest, garnered many votes, because they matched participants' interests during onsite games. During the remote game, headlines that were useful to participants were the ones that accumulated the most votes. Participants' voting behaviours and feelings during game R3 could be affected by the spread of COVID-19, given that the ratios of the headlines \"matched many people's interest\" and \"useful information to me\", and \"matched many people's interest\" and \"matched my interest\" were more than twice during remote games than onsite games.",

The relatively high ratio of the reason \"unexpected/interesting for many people\" during game R3 may reflect the fact that somewhat similar headlines regarding COVID-19 were created during the remote game. Table 18 shows the distribution of the reasons for players' votes in the Keynesian beauty contest and the My Choice voting when adult participants engaged in Type 3 behaviour. Contrary to the tendencies found in Type 1 behaviour, participants tended to place emphasis on headlines matching their interest during game R3 in the My Choice voting, compared to other headlines including those that were useful to them, which were emphasised during games R1 and R2. Given the characteristics of Type 3 behaviour, participants might feel conscious that their interests are different from others' while playing the game remotely. Table 19 shows the responses to Q2. For the reasons stated above, responses to game R1 were excluded from this analysis. Notably, 30% of R3 players and more than half of R2 players considered the headlines they posted to reflect their true selves. This may suggest that the game environment in which participants could not mutually look at each other's faces instigated even adult players to create and post extreme or attention-seeking headlines. Amongst five participants who answered \"other\", two said that they did not worry about what other people thought of them, and another two stated they did not assume that the headlines they posted created their images. Table 20 shows the perceived influence of other players' posting behaviour on participants' own posts based on responses to Q3. Similar response patterns were found between the onsite and remote games.",

            "text": "The OAG is a digital identity education tool based on card-based attention games. It has the benefit of promoting players' free creation of headlines without being conscious of other people around them. However, the current version of the OAG does not allow a facilitator to control the headlines being posted, thus malicious or unwitting posts that can be hurtful to others during a game cannot be prevented. While this reflects the actual circumstances of social media, facilitators nonetheless need to recognise such risks, particularly with immature participants. Through five OAG games, this study explored the tendencies and characteristics of the posting and evaluation behaviours of young university students and adult researchers. We arrived at five main conclusions. First, in both the Keynesian beauty contest and My Choice voting, many players tended to value headlines with \"useful information to many people\". Compared to researchers, students were more likely to vote for headlines they considered \"unexpected/interesting for many people\" in the Keynesian beauty contest, and ones that matched their interests and were \"unexpected/interesting for many people\" in the My Choice voting. However, adult players tend to vote for headlines that matched many people's or their own interests in the OAG-R than the OAG-CS. This tendency may be due to the fact that the OAG-R was conducted during the COVID-19 crisis, and many posted headlines were biased towards the pandemic. Moreover, it could be suggested that the players of the OAG-R did not consider that the posts related to COVID-19 were \"useful information to many people\". Second, many players voted for other players' headlines in the Keynesian beauty contest and yet did not vote for the same headlines in the My Choice voting in the same rounds. This behavioural pattern was commonly observed in each game, regardless of whether the OAG-CS or OAG-R was played. From this, we inferred that the anonymity of posts and votes preserved throughout a game freed players from peer pressure and encouraged them to vote based on their own opinions. These results may be gained from that many players, for both students and researchers, are not confident in their headline postings were popular among other players and thought that their own voting tendencies were different from those of other participants.",

One is that students might understand, or at least ambiguously feel, the risks entailed with thoughtless postings. Another is that they did not realise that their posts could be interpreted differently than they intended due to their immaturity, leading to a distorted online persona. These interpretations should be verified through more OAG experiments.",

The differences in researchers' voting behaviour between the OAG-CS and OAG-R seem to be caused by the content of the posts, more than the settings of the game. Because the free descriptions are adopted for headline postings in the games, it could be considered that the postings were affected by social situations and trends at the time; however, it seems that similar contents posted during the COVID-19 crisis influenced the voting behaviours of other players and the reasons behind them. Further discussions and considerations are required to strengthen this claim.",

This new version enables an analysis of the characteristics in the posting behaviour of players in a situation similar to the real Internet environment, where anonymous observers can vote or make comments. In addition, only researchers were targeted for the OAG-R until now. Therefore, it would be necessary to conduct a similar OAG-R with young people (students) to analyse whether there are differences in headline posting and voting behaviour among the players.",

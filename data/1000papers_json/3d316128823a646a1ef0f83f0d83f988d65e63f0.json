Leveraging on using a customized robotic sewing device and closed-loop visual servoing control, an all-in-one solution for sewing personalized stent graft is demonstrated. Stitch size planning and automatic knot tying are proposed as the two key functions of the system. By using effective stitch size planning, sub-millimetre sewing accuracy is achieved for stitch sizes ranging from 2mm to 5mm. In addition, a thread manipulator for thread management and tension control is also proposed to perform successive knot tying to secure each stitch. Detailed laboratory experiments have been performed to access the proposed instruments and allied algorithms. The proposed framework can be generalised to a wide range of applications including 3D industrial sewing,",

            "text": "Vascular disease is a major contributor to cardiovascular deaths in the world. The incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases significantly with age-by over 300% for those at age 70 compared to those at age 50. Endovascular therapy avoids major trauma associated with open operation, with clear advantages in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality, especially for patients unable to withstand traditional open surgery. This procedure of endovascular intervention requires the use of personalized stent grafts with bespoke openings (fenestrations) and branches for small blood vessels, thus providing better fit for a patient's anatomy. These personalized stent grafts are currently handmade by means of sewing thousands of stitches, which are expensive and timeconsuming. The long delay in customized graft manufacturing can subject patients to the risk of aneurysm rupture and precludes treatment for patients with acute symptoms. The development of an automated stent graft sewing technique would be very helpful to increase the speed of personalized stent manufacturing.",

            "text": "Thus far, a few automated sewing methods have been proposed, e.g., a modified sewing machine is used for sewing tubular shape stent grafts as proposed by [1] . A bobbin, which is seated in a shuttle, carries a bottom thread through the bore of the tubular graft and forms a stitch in combination with a top thread carried on a needle which pierces the graft wall. This solution, however, has a number of potential issues. First, these sewing system is usually specific for one type of stitch; therefore it is not versatile for sewing a custom-made stent graft, which requires running stitch to attach the stent with the graft, applying blanket stitch to finish the edge of a fenestration and even tying knots the secure the sewing. Second, compared with handmade stitch, which only requires using one thread, double thread machine stitches are thick and easily coming out from the fabric once any point breaks. In order to solve the above problem, a visionguided robotic sewing system for stent graft manufacturing is proposed by Huang et al. [2] , [3] . This system mimics human sewing method by learning a specific sewing method from human demonstrations. One limitation of this system is that the success rate is only 75%. We believe the low success rate is mainly because this system uses two robot arms, each holding a grasper to manipulate a curved needle. Because the uncertainty in needle manipulation, e.g. during piercing and re-grasping, the needle might drop and slip from the grasper. In addition, this method uses a look and move method to guide the sewing process, which is slow, and the motion is not smooth, making it difficult to perform delicate stitching with high accuracy. In order to solve this problem, a multipurpose sewing device was developed by us and patented for a wide range of applications including 3D structured object sewing, as well as transferred to other clinical areas such as surgical suturing. This device could switch a double pointed curved needle to perform sewing. The thread is attached to the middle of the needle. The device avoids the problem of needle slippage and dropping in manual sewing. The nominal speed to complete one needle switching is 16s, which shows faster, reliable and more consistent performance than directly operating a surgical needle with a needle holder, making this device a suitable candidate for fully automated robotic sewing. The reader can refer to our following publications for the mechanical design of this new device. In this paper, we propose a robotic sewing system ( Fig. 1 ) integrated with the sewing device and depth sensing, which could automate some sewing tasks, like running stitch and knot tying. The contribution of this work is as follows:",

            "text": "Extensive research on automated sewing has been performed in the apparel industry focusing on incorporating sensors and robots to augment the ability of conventional sewing machines. Relevant topics include fabric tension control for robot-assisted fabric feeding [4] , sewing seam tracking using an optical sensor [5] or a camera system [6] , multi-arm robotic sewing [7] , and automatic sewing worklines [8] . These systems, however, constrained by the incorporation of conventional sewing machines, work only on a flat sewing table. Recently, innovation in 3D structured object sewing is an important topic for industrial manufacturing. KSL Keilmann (Lorsch, Germany) has developed different singlesided sewing heads, such as KSL double needle RS 530, for sewing 3D fabric-reinforced structures for aircraft parts. Different to a conventional sewing machine, which applies stitches by using synchronized parts working on both side of the fabric, the single-sided sewing head features two needles, which are able to apply interwoven chain stitches from the outer surface of a 3D object. These single-sided sewing heads, however, are designed to sew large and heavy objects.",

            "text": "The use of thread to stitch together objects is not only employed in the field of the apparel industry. Automated suturing in the field of robotic surgery is also a hot topic which arouses researchers' attention. Form the software side, a number of works, such as [9] , [10] have been trying to plan the needle trajectory to achieve optimal stitching result. On the hardware side, various suturing devices aiming to facilitate the suturing procedure have been developed, including the Autosuture EndoStitch TM (Covidien, Mansfield, UK) [11] , the SILS TM Suturing Device (Covidien, Mansfield, UK) [12] , Endo360 o Suturing Device, (EndoEvolution North Chelmsford, USA) [13] , the PROXISURE TM Suturing Device (Ethicon, New Jersey, USA) [14] and the Switch R Suturing Device (Mellon Medical, Netherlands) [15] . Based on the aforementioned suturing devices, visionguided robotic suturing systems, such as KidsArm Anastomosis Robot proposed by Looi et al. [16] and Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) proposed by Leonard et al. [17] , [18] , demonstrate that it is feasible for a robot to autonomously perform anastomosis. Knot tying, used for securing the stitches or binding together objects is another important part of the robotic surgery. Making a knot in the confined space of minimally invasive surgery under poor visualization is a very challenging surgical task. The methods of automated knot tying have been proposed for reducing the burden of the surgeon. With using the conventional surgical instruments, a general way to tie a knot is conducted by using one grasper to wind the suture thread around another grasper to form a loop and then used the first grasper to pull the tail end of the suture through the loop. To achieve automated knot tying, various methods were proposed, e.g. thread shape modelling [19] , instrument moment planning [20] , and learning from surgeons' demonstration [21] . Another direction for automated knot tying is by designing specific hardware, e.g. [22] proposed a knot tying device for minimally invasive surgery, [23] proposed a single piece fixture for knot tying, and [24] uses the Endostitch TM suturing device and a grasper with a flexible hook to make a knot.",

This is accomplished by a combined used of the sewing device and a novel thread manipulation mechanism, called thread manipulator. Different with previous methods, one unique feature of the device is that it can perform successive stitching and knot tying along the sewing trajectory without cutting or replacing the thread. Making a loop and passing the thread end through the loop are two critical procedures for knot tying. The thread manipulator is introduced for three purposes: assisting in making a loop, keeping the thread in a known position and preventing the thread from floating everywhere, which may hinder the sewing process. The two flexible hooks attached to the thread manipulator can assist to make a loop. By moving the tip of the sewing device around the two flexible hooks, followed by the needle end of the thread, a loop is made. The reason for using two flexible hooks is that if the thread segment between the two flexible hooks is pulled tightly, the sewing device could easily pass the needle around the fixed thread segment to make an overhand knot.",

We measure the distance between the entry and exit points of the thread on the fabric as the actual stitch size. The quantitative and qualitative results of the experiment are shown in Table I and Fig. 6 , respectively. The error for each trial is calculated as the mean absolute difference between the desired and actual stitch size. Most trials achieve an error less than 0.6mm except the 1mm trial which has an average error of 1.2mm. The actual stitch size for the 1mm group is always not less than 2mm which leads to a consistent error. The main reason of the error is that as the sewing device closes the jaws to pass the needle in the fabric (as shown in step 4 of Fig. 4) , the left side of the jaw would press and deform the fabric when the needle comes out of the fabric.",

In order to perform sewing on the surface of the stent graft, a cylindrical object, called a mandrel, is used for holding the graft and the stent in place during sewing. This mandrel provides tension for the fabric being sewn. The area under the stent graft is hollow so that the needle can easily pierce through without contacting with the mandrel. The thickness, edge length and the diameter of the stent used in this experiment is 0.4mm, 12mm and 22mm respectively.",

Similar to the running stitch experiment, the user selects the desired knot position on the sewing target, which is along the stent edge in this case. The tail of the thread is attached to a fixed position before starting using our method to successively apply stitch and knot. Once the robot finishes the stitch, it moves the sewing device to the standby pose followed by the knot tying step. In this paper, we used a nylon thread with a diameter of 0.2mm which has been used for commercial handmade stent graft. The desired force to keep the thread tension is 0.7N along the dominant axis while the force required to secure a knot is around 2N. The length of the thread used for the experiment is approximated 250mm, which could be applied for tying 12-16 knots using our method. The execution time of the vision-guided stitching and tying a single knot is about 3 minutes and 2 minutes, respectively. See the supplementary video via https:// youtu.be/WX63S55PE3w.",

Due to the geometry constraints of the circular needle, the sewing device is not suitable for making a stitch whose size is larger than 5mm. It is worth noting that making a small stitch less than 2mm needs to consider deformation of the fabric. To solve this problem, a new mechanism which could precisely reorientate the sewing device is helpful. Then the robot arm only serves for positioning purpose. In addition, we found the tension on the fabric is another factor which can influence the sewing accuracy. The needle may fail to enter the fabric or stitch a wrong position if the fabric is not well tensioned.",

The point cloud of the sewing targets obtained from the depth camera can be noisy as the fabric surface is slanted in the camera view. To address this issue, the fabric can be brought towards the camera which also requires modification of the pattern attached to the device as it needs to be visible for the visual servoing. Another limitation of the vision system is the resolution of the depth camera which is only 640x480. When the user selects the target on the image, the 3D position of adjacent pixels can be very far. Nevertheless, this can be addressed as the hardware is upgraded (the latest RealSense TM D-series depth camera supports 1280x720 resolution). Furthermore, a useful improvement for the proposed system is the markerless tracking of the device or needle. This will extend the flexibility of the system by allowing control of the sewing device from different viewing angles and occlusion.",

            "text": "For the knot tying experiment, we have demonstrated a promising solution for applications requires successively applying knot to secure each stitch. This could secure the stent more reliably compared with purely using running stitch. During the experiment, some issues were also identified. First, to keep the tension on a long thread, the arm holding the thread manipulator needs to move a long distance, which is not cost-effective and may reach its workspace limitation. A rolling mechanism which could automatically wind the thread can be a potential solution. Second, the overhand knot made by the robot is tied around an object. The knot has the working end brought over and under the standing end. It can also be called a half hitch. To better secure each stitch, it is desired to apply two successive half hitches to make up the common clove hitch. Third, the direction and force to pull the thread to secure the knot are important to make a proper knot. As shown in Fig. 7 , the robot made knot is not as tight as the handmade knot. The thread used in our experiment is more elastic which can be loose even it is pulled tightly. However, another more important reason is that it is not the optimal directions for pulling the thread to place the knot. Kang et al. [24] has proposed a knot sliding condition for properly placing a knot, which can be further investigated in future.",

We have used closed-loop visual servoing based on RGBD sensing to achieve accurate device positioning and steady motion which benefits the autonomous stitching. Leveraging on this novel system, a trajectory planning method for the sewing various stitch sizes is proposed. In addition, a novel thread manipulator with force sensing capability is proposed for thread manipulation during knot tying. The thread manipulator allows simplified thread manipulation during the robotic sewing. We have demonstrated that the proposed system can accomplish continuous stitches with reasonable accuracy as well as successively tie overhand knots for the stent graft manufacturing. The system has shown the potential to be transferred to other clinical areas such as surgical suturing.",

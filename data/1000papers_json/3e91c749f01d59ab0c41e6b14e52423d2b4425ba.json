A rapid spread of the virus facilitated by globalization resulted in WHO's pandemic declaration on March 11th 2020. As of October 27th, 43 million cases were reported globally, with a mortality rate exceeding one million (1) . In spite of the constitution of a newly discovered coronavirus global health emergency shifted scientists' attention to defining clinical picture and developing treatment as well as prophylaxis, so far, accumulated knowledge is rather fragmentary. Although knowledge of emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic remains scarce, there is no doubt that the resilience of diverse communities worldwide was considerably challenged both directly and indirectly. Among a wide range of reported manifestations, there are depression, insomnia, anxiety, fear, anger, confusion, or post-traumatic stress symptoms, along with considerable disruptions of everyday routine and stigmatization (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . The reported manifestations are not COVID-19 specific.",

            "text": "The outbreak of SARS was regarded as a mental health catastrophe (7) . PTSD was the most prevalent long-term psychiatric condition, followed by depressive disorder (8) . In a cross-sectional study on a general population, Sim et al. (9) , found significant rates of SARS-related psychiatric and post-traumatic comorbidities (22.9 and 25.8%, respectively) 16 weeks after the first local outbreak of SARS in Singapore. They found that psychiatric morbidity was associated with a high level of post-traumatic symptoms and was associated with the increased use of denial and planning as coping measures (9) . An online survey addressed to the general population in China at the turn of January and February 2020 showed that most respondents, the majority were women of younger age groups (24-30.8 years of age); described the immediate impact of the Covid-19 epidemic as moderate to severe; more than a quarter declared severe anxiety while 16.5% suffered severe depressive signs (10) . In a cross-sectional study in China, demographic data and mental health measurements from 1,257 health care workers were collected. The survey revealed a high prevalence of mental health symptoms among health care workers treating patients with COVID-19. A considerable number of participants had symptoms of depression (634, 50.4%), anxiety (560, 44.6%), insomnia (427, 34.0%), and distress (899, 71.5%). Lai et al. (11) indicated that being a woman and having an intermediate technical title were associated with experiencing severe depression, anxiety, and distress (11) . Li et al. (12) also found that although no significant differences were observed between the severity of vicarious traumatization in the non-front-line nurses and the general public, its severity was significantly higher than that of the front-line nurses in close contact with patients with COVID- 19 Maciaszek et al. (13) based on a national survey in Poland, aimed to compare psychopathological expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical and non-medical professionals. Out of 2,039 participants, 1,216 (59.6%) individuals represented medical professions while 823 (40.4%) pursued non-medical occupations. Regardless of career, the vast majority of respondents were women (80.0% among medical professionals and 74.4% among non-medical professionals). They found the prevalence of anxiety, insomnia, and somatic symptoms among medical professionals were higher than in non-medical workers. Also, the determinants of psychopathological expressions in these two groups differ in terms of age, care for an elderly or disabled person, contact with COVID-19 at work, and contact with COVID-19 without protection measures (13) .",

            "text": "Among the most prominent challenges medical professionals face amid the pandemic are fear of erratic recommendations, working overtime, fear of infection, passing it on family members, using personal protective equipment, and treating fellow workers and critically ill patients (14) (15) (16) . A consistent pattern of a detrimental impact on the medical staff 's psychological and physical well-being was already discussed concerning past outbreaks (14, (17) (18) (19) . The considerable jobspecific hardship put on medical workers during a possible epidemic was emphasized in an Australian study by Martinese et al. (2009) (19) . Their study explored work attitudes to two hypothetical influenza scenarios: (a) a single patient admitted with avian influenza; and (b) multiple patients admitted with a new strain of human influenza during a pandemic. The results indicate the majority of respondents, primarily female (twothirds), aged between 21 and 50 years (three-quarters), and nurses (44%), would not show up for work unless adequate vaccination or antiviral drugs were available at hand undeterred of accessibility of necessary preventive measures. Joob et al. (2020) (20) , citing a study by Yasri et al. (2020) (21) underline aggressive attitude toward doctors, such as frequent direct verbal insults or intentional coughing at medical staff in Thailand. As the authors point out, such behavior was not previously observed and might be attributed to the coronavirus outbreak because people are under much stress during a crisis. Additionally, Li et al. (12) highlight the vicarious traumatization of health care workers with no direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2 mirrors levels observed in the general population and consequently affects their everyday work under the extraordinary pressure of the epidemiological crisis (11) . Moreover (20) , in a study where the majority of participants were between the ages of 18 -30 years (42.4%) and 31 -40 years (60.7%), described that working with stressed colleagues provides additional psychological stress in medical respondents irrespective of age (22) .",

            "text": "Considering the magnitude of distress and social repercussions of past outbreaks, psychological problems should be expected (23) and appropriately addressed to enhance public health response (24) . The great variety of responses and their moderators should be considered mitigating the outbreak's impact. One of the essential factors that may impact individual responses to the outbreak related to stress are coping strategies. To a certain degree, one's performance in the face of stress relates to used coping strategies that may boost not only the health-related quality of life (25) but also impact the prevalence of anxiety and depression (26) , insomnia (27) , or post-traumatic stress disorder (28) . Based on the definition created by Lazarus et al. (29) coping combines both cognitive and behavioral attempts to manage internal and external requirements related to an incredibly stressful event. As Doron et al. (30) point out, many studies investigating the relationships between cognitive coping and mental health adopt a dichotomous coping view. Such a dichotomous approach has strengths and weaknesses. However, as others have identified, instead of focusing on a single coping strategy examining cognitive and behavioral coping strategies in terms of \"profiles\" that exist across individuals using cluster analytical procedures might be a better approach (30) (31) (32) (33) . The multidimensional nature of coping has already been used in different contexts (34, 35) and showed that clustering coping actions into categories and thus creating coping strategy clusters reflects actual psychological outcome more adequately as one can use more than one coping strategy as well as combine adaptive and maladaptive strategies at once. In line with the theory proposed by Lazarus and Folkman (29) mentioned above, we wanted to find out the relationship between peoples coping strategies in relation to stressful events such as Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to explore the following research questions:",

The snowball sampling method was used to recruit adult representatives of both medical and non-medical professions through social media and email addresses. The survey was posted on social media groups, forums, and websites, both health-related and not. Researchers used their social backgrounds to distribute the survey among their medical and non-medical friends and families to a lesser extent. The healthcare professionals included doctors, nurses, paramedics, and allied medical workers such as pharmacists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, technicians, and administrators. Only wholly filled questionnaires met the inclusion criteria for the analysis. Consent for participation and record of sent data was required.",

The scope of possible answers incorporates a 4-point Likert scale (0 -not at all, 1 -no more than usual, 2 -rather more than usual, 3 -much more than usual). The range of possible outcomes extends from 0 to 84, with higher scores indicating higher levels of distress. The cut-off score for clinically relevant symptoms was set at 24 points (37) and thus outcomes exceeding this score were labeled as positive GHQ-28. According to Makowska et al. (38) , the GHQ-28 Cronbach's alpha was estimated at 0.93 when the Polish version was used and it was evaluated to be 0.94 in the current sample.",

A great deal of research has already emphasized cluster analysis legitimacy exploring coping strategy clusters (11, (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) . It may mirror actual responses to stressful transactions more adequately and help predict possible severe psychological distress and psychopathological symptoms. In our study, three clusters of coping strategies emerged and were tagged as nonspecific, maladaptive, and adaptive, taking into account the used combination's prevailing character. Interestingly, no statistically significant differences were found in using strategies of active coping, planning, positive reframing, and acceptance and behavioral disengagement when non-specific and maladaptive strategy clusters were compared. Similarly, such relation was observed regarding denial, substance use, and self-blame in non-specific and adaptive. This suggests that using a single coping strategy may not determine the whole response as adaptive or maladaptive. Umucu et al. (43) , examining a sample of individuals with self-reported chronic disorders and disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzed single coping strategies and concluded that strategies such as selfdistraction, denial, substance use, behavioral disengagement, venting, planning, religion, and self-blame were positively correlated with perceived coronavirus-related stress (43) .",

Different types of stressors are encountered as individuals age, and these differences in stressors, as well as associated life events, have an impact on coping strategies and health outcomes. Although most young adults are at low risk of physical health complications from COVID-19, they may be concerned with secondary consequences. Justo-Alonso et al. (44) showed that young people are more likely to be psychologically affected by COVID-19 significantly, while the oldest showed better psychological responses in general. However, there were slight differences between age groups in our study and adapted coping strategies as respondents were from the same age category. This being said, juxtaposing our results with recent research, psychological response to COVID-19 could vary among different age groups that may have clinical implications such as anxiety and depression. Additionally, according to Cai et al., the biggest concern of medical workers aged 31-40 years old was passing on viral infection to their young children and parents (22) . In our study, such a dilemma was reflected in the more frequent use of maladaptive coping strategies in being a parent. However, this did not apply to being a caregiver of a senior or disabled person privately. Interestingly, when regression analysis of factors influencing worse mental health outcomes was performed, female sex emerged to be the only socio-demographic independent variable predicting significantly worse mental health outcomes. In this context, it might be related to cultural demand to adopt the primary care provider's role.",

This suggests that they may try to get rid of thoughts and emotions resembling the trauma and avoid discussing them. In turn, it may be problematic in the context of establishing a therapeutic relationship with that group or designing proper supporting actions. Furthermore, active coping, which is considered to be an adaptive coping strategy and is associated with taking actions to improve the specific situation, was related to higher intrusion scores and thus recurrent thought and nightmares concerning trauma. This may be connected to lacking expertise and significant restrictions introduced due to the pandemic and frustration and helplessness. Likewise, planning, usually classified as an adaptive strategy, did not significantly determine IES-R scores. This stands in line with the research by Sim et al. (9) regarding experience from the SARS outbreak. Moreover, in our study, only seeking emotional support was found to reduce both totals and all subscales' scores of IES-R and thus mitigate overall discomfort along with specific dimensions of PTSD in contrast to seeking instrumental support even though they are both components of social coping.",

Unless medical services take active measures and adopt a proactive approach, the pandemic's psychological consequences on healthcare staff could be dramatic. Given that the COVID-19 can lead to various mental health outcomes, understanding risk and resilience factors might hold a grand promise for developing specific interventions that aim to restore psychological well-being. Medical professionals armed with holistic training could better identify a fellow front-line worker experiencing anxiety or depression symptoms and provide support while maintaining the fluidity of healthcare in the face of a crisis (pandemic) (53) .

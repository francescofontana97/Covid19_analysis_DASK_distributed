To this end, prompt testing of symptomatic individuals [2, 5] as well as follow-up testing of exposed and recovering patients potentially shedding SARS-CoV-2 are important for case identification, contact tracing, infection control, and clinical patient management [6] [7] [8] . Detecting viral RNA in respiratory fluids by reverse transcription-quantitative nucleic acid testing (RT-QNAT) is currently the gold standard for the specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 replication and CoVID-19 [9] . The rapid availability of viral genome sequences in January 2020 facilitated the development of RT-QNAT protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection [10-12], followed by a range of commercial SARS-CoV-2 assays in the subsequent months [12] [13] [14] [15] . In our center, we applied a prospective parallel testing strategy using the laboratory-developed Basel-S-gene RT-QNAT assay together with a commercial assay for rapid delivery of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 results in the early pandemic phase until March 2020 [11] . To meet the increasing demand of SARS-CoV-2 tests, and to reduce the hands-on time in the laboratory, we prospectively validated a fully automated SARS-CoV-2-assay. Here, we report on the prospective comparison of our established approach with the automated high-throughput Roche-cobas\u00ae6800-Target1/Target2 using nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS).",

Both goals are critically dependent on the performance of diagnostic assays, which again are impacted by the prevalence and dynamics following effective lockdown measures and their relaxation. There are only limited real-life data available addressing these diagnostic and epidemiologic challenges in a comprehensive manner. In this study, we report the qualitative and quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 QNAT assays for the diagnosis and in clinically relevant settings of patient follow-up and describe the impact following lockdown and relaxation in Northwestern Switzerland. Our prospective cross-validation of 1344 NOPS demonstrates that a fully automated dual-target assay has a high positive and negative predictive value of 99.5% and 98.7%, respectively, at a prevalence of 15% for a qualitative result, which changes to 91.9% and 99.9% at rates around 1%. Expectedly, single-target assays are more dramatically affected. Thus, this real-life setting indicates the need for confirmatory information in up to 8% of clinical cases and point to critical limitations of large-scale screening of the general population and impact the validity of sample pooling endeavors. Both approaches are discussed for assessing periods of effective containment as well as for testing populations with difficult to define SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk such as returning travelers.",

The epidemiologic dynamics were captured by weekly detection rates, which steadily declined to <1% and then flared up to 4%, both at approximately 6 weeks following lockdown and relaxation measures, respectively. Although we cannot define the key factors for either development, the demographics reveal a significantly younger median age of only 34 years of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in the follow-up cohort-2 compared to approximately 50 years in the validation and follow-up cohort-1. Although the proportion of children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 had also significantly increased from 3% to 10%, the interquartile age range of follow-up cohort-2 indicated that the recent SARS-CoV-2 flare was mostly due to younger adults between 24 and 48 years of age. These data suggest that behavioral factors were underlying these developments, which might reflect older populations remaining more adherent to (self-)protective measures, while younger adults accepted increased exposure risks such traveling and gathering in larger groups during this period of summer holidays and school closure in Switzerland.",

A recent study reported that medical attention was sought on average 3 to 5 days after symptoms onset similar to other influenza-like illnesses [19] . Conversely, most of our 261 patients providing follow-up NOPS were hospitalized and in their sixth age decade associated with more severe disease including the need for intensive care. Although we cannot exclude that the median time to undetectable NOPS viral load may be shorter in a-or oligosymptomatic infections than in our patients, the 99.9% decline within 10 days in all 261 patients or in a subgroup of 79 patients with very high sampling density and their median time to undetectable SARS-CoV-2 in NOPS at 14 days (IQR 9 -20) after diagnosis provides some orientation for confirmatory diagnostics and infection control measures.

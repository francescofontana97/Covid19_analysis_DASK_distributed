            "text": "COVID-19 is a global pandemic that affected the everyday life activities of billions around the world. It is an unprecedented crisis that the modern world had never experienced before. It mainly affected the economic state and the health care system. The rapid and increasing number of infected patients overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructure, which causes high demand and, thus, shortage in the required staff members and medical resources. This shortage necessitates practical and ethical suggestions to guide clinicians and medical centers when allocating and reallocating scarce resources for and between COVID-19 patients. Many studies proposed a set of ethical principles that should be applied and implemented to address this problem. In this study, five different ethical principles based on the most commonly recommended principles and aligned with WHO guidelines and state-of-the-art practices proposed in the literature were identified, and recommendations for their applications were discussed. Furthermore, a recent study highlighted physicians' propensity to apply a combination of more than one ethical principle while prioritizing the medical resource allocation. Based on that, an ethical framework that is based on Fuzzy inference systems was proposed. The proposed framework's input is the identified ethical principles, and the output is a weighted value (per patient). This value can be used as a rank or a priority factor given to the patients based on their condition and other relevant information, like the severity of their disease status. The main idea of implementing fuzzy logic in the framework is to combine more than one principle when calculating the weighted value, hence mimicking what some physicians apply in practice. Moreover, the framework's rules are aligned with the identified ethical principles. This framework can help clinicians and guide them while making critical decisions to allocate/reallocate the limited medical resources during the current COVID-19 crisis and future similar pandemics.",

Ten percent of positively tested patients in Italy needed intensive care to overcome the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Moreover, due to the exponential rise of the number of COVID-19 patients, there was an actual risk of running out of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and other medical resources, including face masks and shields (12, 13) . Many medical centers in Italy respond to the largest outbreak of COVID-19 outside Asia by developing and applying their response plans (14) . As the number of COVID-19 cases is still increasing worldwide, mainly due to the second wave and virus mutations, in addition to the limitation of medical resources, doctors and medical professionals are left with the hardest decision to make: whom should be saved first? The decision to select one patient over the others is affected by principles, which may vary based on cultural, religious, and humanity-related reasons (15) (16) (17) .",

Previous pandemics such as influenza also required high demand from the health systems, and protocols to prevent, control, and mitigate the effects of influenza had been provided (18). Similarly, medical centers and hospitals provided recommendations for containing and managing COVID-19, with a particular interest in the best practice of scarce medical resource allocation. The guiding principles discussed by Emanuel et al. (19) to allocate resources during COVID-19 recommended that the ICU workers act in a way that strives to save the most number of lives and/or maximize the life-years saved. This means \"allocating scarce resources to patients who are sick enough to benefit but also have the best chance of survival\" (20) . Although this guidance is essential, it might cause a bias since this principle does not uphold all persons' protected rights (21) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), excluding population groups from being allocated medical resources would be inappropriate (22) . Moreover, resource allocation should be guided by well-established and broadlyapplicable ethical principles when there is insufficient supply to meet everyone's needs.",

They suggested four ethical principles: firstly, the benefit from reducing mortality should be assessed using the best available evidence. Allowing policies should be revised as evidence develops, and medications should be prioritized during the shortage. Secondly, the choices of each patient should be respected. However, when there is an insufficient supply of medications, it may not be possible to follow individual patients and their physicians' preferences. Thirdly, in order to avoid discrimination and mitigate health disparities, scarce medications should be allocated fairly. Lastly, allocation policies should be made accountable, responsive to the concerns of those affected, transparent, and comparable to the situation, including the progression of the epidemic and the proportion of the supply and demand of medications. Moreover, Brown and Goodwin (24) pointed out that resource allocation guidance should be in alliance with anti-discriminatory criteria such as disability, socioeconomic status, race, and insurance status.",

This is also aligned with the Italian physicians' guidelines; give higher priority to the young patients when assigning intensive care supplies (16, 17) .

However, at the time of crises, health care systems experienced extensive pressure and shortened in medical resources, despite the country's wealth. This is what most of the countries faced during the current pandemic, COVID-19, and hence allocating scarce medical resources was not a straight forward process. Combining more than one ethical principle to determine who should be given medical attention might be a good process to follow. This paper aims to identify the most commonly recommended ethical principles and provide recommendations for their applications. Furthermore, propose an ethical framework using fuzzy logic that guides clinicians' decisions in allocating medical resources to COVID-19 patients. This framework gives weight to patients based on five ethical principles identified according to WHO guidelines and state-of-the-art practices proposed in the literature. However, the proposed framework is solely based on the ethical principles applied when allocating the currently available scarce medical resources to the current patients arriving at a hospital. The differences between rich and developing countries and considering per-hospital resources in addition to the availability of resources at different times in the same hospital were not within the scope of the proposed ethical framework.",

It is sometimes hard to apply only one principle, like youngest first, since physicians tend to assess the need by applying more than one principle at once to maximize the benefits. Therefore, a combined criterion (based on more than one principle) is often more preferred. This is highlighted in a recent comprehensive study conducted in Jordan to assess general public opinions regarding allocating scarce medical resources, and physicians tend to choose combined criteria while deciding who should be given medical attention first (26) . Based on that, an ethical framework that combined multiple ethical principles to prioritize medical resource allocation decisions is proposed. Fuzzy Logic (31) was used to model this framework to handle the companion uncertainty.",

Thus, instead of having a step value such as 0 or 1, a value can be between 0 and 1, like 0.4. The advantage of fuzzy logic is that it describes the problem in terms of linguistic variables, like age: old or young, making it a powerful tool for managing the vagueness and uncertainty efficiently (31). A Fuzzy inference system is an inference system based on fuzzy logic to infer values using a predefined set of rules. The inference system consists of three main steps: fuzzification, rules evaluation, and defuzzification (32) . The inputs and outputs are variables that can have real numbers values. In the fuzzification step, real number inputs are mapped to the fuzzy domain by converting each value into a fuzzy value (linguistic term). For example, if the variable can have any value in the range [0, 1], say 0.3, then the fuzzy value that corresponds to this value is Low. On the other hand, if the input is 0.8, then the fuzzy value is High. Any value in between can be Moderate. In the second step, a set of predefined rules are evaluated. The rule has the following format assuming n fuzzy values for the input variable and m fuzzy values for the ",

This research identified the most commonly recommended ethical principles in accordance with WHO guidelines and literature's best practices and provide recommendations for their applications.

We evaluated patients who had been prescribed therapeutic anticoagulation prior to hospitalization and who then continued therapeutic anticoagulation during hospitalization. We also evaluated patients who had not been prescribed therapeutic anticoagulation prior to hospitalization and who then began therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation during hospitalization. The anticoagulants specified in the database included those used at Northwestern Medicine: apixaban, argatroban, bivalirudin, dabigatran, dalteparin, edoxaban, enoxaparin, fondaparinux, heparin, rivaroxaban, and warfarin. One author (NGP) manually reviewed the records for the index hospitalization for each patient who received at least one dose of therapeutic anticoagulation to determine the indication for anticoagulation and whether therapeutic anticoagulation had been prescribed prior to admission or was newly started while hospitalized. We categorized patients into the following six groups: continued home therapeutic anticoagulation, started therapeutic anticoagulation for concern of COVID-19 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f anticoagulation during hospitalization, or no anticoagulation during hospitalization.

Third, we did not evaluate outcomes by individual anticoagulant drug. It is possible that the clinical effects of DOACs and LMWH differ in patients with COVID-19 (27, 43) . Fourth, we did not control for the number of days patients received new therapeutic anticoagulation because we were unable to determine the timing of starting these medications within the course of COVID-19 infection. Finally, we did not assess the rate of bleeding in our population as it would require a detailed chart review of timing and severity of bleeding. Anticoagulation is a well-known risk factor for bleeding and risk of bleeding may be higher in patients with COVID-19 (33, (44) (45) .",

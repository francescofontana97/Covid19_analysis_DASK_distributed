Subjects and methods In this retrospective, observational study we included medical reports of 96 eyes (51 patients), who underwent VF testing with TED-CON in Ludwig-Maximilians-University (2008-2019). Two readers separately examined the VFs at the time of the TED-CON diagnosis, each offering two readings of the same VF in a time interval of 1 month. None of our patients were diagnosed with only VF testing. The visual field testing was only performed when the inclusion criteria for TED-CON were met. Results The most common VF defects upon TED-CON diagnosis were stage 1b defects in FT classification (34.4% for reader 1, 35.4% for reader 2), followed by stage 2b (10.4% for reader 1, 14.6% for reader 2), and stage 3 (10.4% for both readers).",

The intrareader reproducibility ranged from substantial to almost perfect (78.1% agreement) between readings (kappa 0.736 (95%CI [0.638-0.834])) for reader 1 and 90.6% agreement (kappa 0.885 (95%CI [0.814-0.956])) for reader 2. Conclusion We found good BCVA (LogMAR \u2264 0.2), in nearly half of the cases (44 eyes, 45.8%) and also, strikingly near perfect visual acuity (BCVA LogMAR \u22640.1) in 22.9% of the cases (22 eyes) with TED-CON. We conclude that clinicians should be alert to VF defects in the inferior region (stage 1a/1b in the FT classification) even in patients with a good BCVA.",

Even with these examinations at hand, diagnosis can be difficult due to multifactorial causes underlying visual loss.

We examined the medical charts of all patients with a definitive diagnosis of TED-CON who underwent VF testing in Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Department of Ophthalmology between 2008 and 2019. After collecting the data from the medical charts, we found 116 VFs with a diagnosis of TED-CON. Six VFs were excluded due to high fixation losses exceeding our threshold (malfixation defined as fixation losses \u226533%). Two VFs from both eyes of one patient were also dropped due to the proliferative diabetic retinopathy documented in her medical records, which could affect the VF examination. Also, one eye of a patient with amblyopia and one eye of another patient with a history of retinal detachment were left out. We wanted to have robust data on the VFs and therefore excluded cases with other diseases which could affect the examination results.",

The VF tests were judged by a glaucoma specialist (LR) as well as an ophthalmic plastic specialist (AGK) to determine if they indicated abnormality according the FT classification. The criteria for pathological VF included: (i) having a single point worse than the 0.5% pointwise probability level on the total, or pattern deviation probability plots, and (ii) three clustered points beyond normal limits (P < 0.05) and \u22651 point worse than the 1% level on the total or pattern deviation plot [5] . We (LR and AGK) then categorized the pathological cases using the FT classification, which identifies ten parts and three stages to describe the severity of the VF defect. Importantly, each examiner applied the classification twice (randomizing the order) and independently from one another. Comparison of results from the same examiner, and across the two examiners, allowed us to assess intrareader reproducibility, and interreader agreement of the FT classification, respectively.

Similar to FT, we observed in our data the inferior defects to be the most common ones in TED-CON patients, and thus, confirmed the precision of the classification for detection this particular pathology. And, although we did not have a longitudinal design like FT, the fact that we observed similar frequencies of defects with observations at a single point in time underlines the usefulness of the classification even with limited data.",

It is worth noting that the classification lead to perfect interreader agreement for stage 3 defects (where the MD value suggested a cut-off >20 dB).",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed binding constraints on our diagnostic resources and highlighted the importance of alternative methods for detecting hard-todiagnose conditions, such as TED-CON. We point out two alternative strategies for detecting TED-CON (other than the tests we have considered in this study). The first strategy is based on Neigel et al.'s [9] work, which identified the greying of vision (or desaturation of colours) as a chief symptom in TED-CON patients. But, crucially, patients mentioned this symptom only when directly asked about it. Therefore, when faced with restrictions on diagnostic tools available to them, clinicians can simply ask their patients about this particular symptom when they suspect TED-CON as a possible condition. The second strategy for diagnosing TED-CON, one that would shorten the examination time and provide a more objective measure, is to use optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Zhang et al. [15] , for example, detected a decrease in vessel density in the peripapillary area in TED-CON patients with optical coherence angiography. Similarly, Park et al. [16] found significant difference in inferior peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer between acute and chronic TED-CON patients, as well as between TED-CON patients and a control group, using OCT [16] . These findings suggest the potential of imaging tools for detecting TED-CON, but more future work is needed to fully evaluate the usefulness of these alternative tools. We do not feel VF screening of all TED patients for TED-CON is realistic, particularly in the post COVID healthcare landscape. We recommend VF testing only patients with suspected TED-CON to confirm the diagnosis and to monitor for progression.",

Even more striking is the fact that about a fourth of our cases (22 eyes) had a BCVA LogMAR \u2264 0.1, indicating minimal-to-no worsening in BCVA. This pattern points to the need for performing other tests, such as VF examination, in suspected TED-CON patients as soon as possible.

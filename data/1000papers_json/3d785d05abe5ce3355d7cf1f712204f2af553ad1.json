From this microscopic approach, we recover the networks of close contacts within consecutive time windows. A longitudinal comparison is then performed by upscaling the traced contacts with the transmission computed from a mean-field compartmental model for the entire city. Our results show that the effective reproduction numbers inside the buses, Re bus , and in the city, Re city , followed a compatible behavior during the first wave of the local outbreak. Moreover, by distinguishing the close contacts of healthcare workers in the buses, we discovered that their transmission, Re health , during the same period, was systematically higher than Re bus . This result reinforces the need for special public transportation policies for highly exposed groups of people.",

Considering that non-pharmacological interventions, such as social distancing and isolation, still represent fundamental measures to control the COVID-19 outbreak, the nature of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination also unveils the need to understand the role of the space where interaction between people occurs. There is consensus that superspreading events, which are usually investigated through contact tracing models [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , are more likely to happen in indoor environment, as substantiated by previous studies of indoor contagion in hospitals [8, 9] , restaurants [10] , offices [11] , and even on cruise ships [12, 13] . However, the relation between the microscopic level of contagion in indoor environments and the macroscopic observables, such as the numbers of cases and deaths at the city scale remains unclear.",

In spite of the fact that some cities have adopted social distancing and sanitary protocols on public transportation to control the COVID-19 outbreak, it is common that buses or subways get crowded at rush hour, mainly in the developing countries. In recent months, some studies have been proposed to establish the safety of public transportation regarding the indoor COVID-19 contagion [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . To the best of our knowledge, however, none of these studies have considered the possibility of a comparative analysis based on a two-fold perspective, namely, the dynamic of people's movement in a city and the dynamic of the virus dissemination within vehicles of public transport.",

Precisely, the proposed network is composed of vertices p i that represent the passengers diagnosed with COVID-19, and weighted directed edges c k = (p i , p j , \u03c4 ij ) that represent PICs. For each edge, the direction is assigned from an infectious passenger p i to an exposed passenger p j , and the weight \u03c4 ij is defined as the estimated value of the ride time shared by p i and p j on the same bus, as shown in Fig. 1a .",

The exposed period refers to the time window during which the passenger can get the virus and maintain it latent until the infectious period. In this context, the exposed period begins 14 days before OS and ends 2 days before OS, i.e., the infectious and the exposed periods have a width of 14 and 12 days, respectively, and they do not overlap [28] [29] [30] . Furthermore, if there is more than one PIC related to an exposed passenger p j , we consider solely the edge with the largest value of \u03c4 ij .

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that any contact tracing strategy for COVID-19 should consider the concept of Close Contacts (CCs) [31] , i.e., anybody who has been for at least 15 minutes within 6 feet (\u2248 2 meters) of an infectious person. Since buses are small, enclosed, and they have a great tendency to get crowded at rush hours, we define the CCs in the network of PICs only considering the time condition \u03c4 ij > \u03c4 c , where the threshold \u03c4 c = 15 minutes. Applying this criterion to the network of PICs, we find that the network of CCs is composed of 154 trees with a total of 360 vertices (infectious passengers) and 206 edges (CCs). In this case, 75 vertices were identified as healthcare workers. In order to understand the COVID-19 spreading in public transportation, we define the effective reproduction number for the contact tracing model, Re bus , as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single (typical) infection.

The reported infectious population I r corresponds to the number of individuals that had the SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the health system. The unreported infectious population I u comprises the complement of I r , i.e., individuals that were infected with COVID-19 but remained unknown to health authorities. We assume that the large majority of the reported infectious individuals are symptomatic cases, in contrast to the population of unreported infectious individualsof which the large majority is assumed to be of asymptomatic cases. Given this fundamental assumption and considering the recent finding that asymptomatic people are 42% less likely to transmit the SARS-CoV-2 than symptomatic ones [33] , we define that the transmission rate for the unreported infectious population I u is reduced by a factor of \u00b5 in relation to the parameter \u03b2 that represents the transmission rate for the reported infectious population I r .",

First, it is reasonable to assume that Re bus r = Re city r , as long as the population traveling by public buses can be considered as statistically equivalent, from an epidemiologic point of view, to the rest of the city. As a consequence of this assumption and using Eq. (9), we can write that In Figure 5 , we show the comparison between the estimates of Re bus and Re city from March to November 2020. Although the contact tracing and compartmental models are defined on different scales, the former on a microscopic scale and the latter on a macroscopic scale, the two curves capture the same decreasing trend associated to both social isolation and lockdown periods. We note that Re bus consistently follows Re city during the local COVID-19 outbreak, except for a three-month period between the first and the second waves of daily cases. In this period, the Re bus decayed to undetectable standards despite the fact that the number of daily bus validations has increased (see Fig. 2a ). As also shown in show that Re bus consistently follows Re city during the local COVID-19 outbreak, except for a three-month period between the first and the second waves of daily cases. Furthermore, the transmission from healthcare workers within buses until the end of July is characterized by a value of Re health persistently greater than Re bus . Healthcare workers, even the non-frontline professionals, are more likely to get and, consequently, spread the pathogen because their social network distances to individuals that tested positive for COVID-19 are very short compared to non-highly exposed workers. Despite being more tested, healthcare workers may not even know that they are infectious when they board a bus due to eventual time delays of the result of a COVID-19 test. Other groups of highly exposed people may affect the dynamics of dissemination of the virus in a similar way, e.g., education workers and police officers. Therefore, our results reinforce the worldwide claim that it is imperative to propose special policies to support displacement (or to avoid it) of highly exposed groups of people. Finally, we suggest that the intensity and the necessity of using public transportation by highly exposed groups must be seriously considered as a criterion to prioritize their vaccination.",

The inference framework starts from an initial state vector X (0) = {S, E, I r , I u , R, D r } (0) , and an initial parameter vector \u03b8 (0) = {\u03b2, \u00b5, \u03c3, \u03b3, \u03b1, \u03c6} (0) . To these vectors, uncertainties are attributed in terms of the variance matrices \u03c3 X and \u03c3 \u03b8 , respectively. For each iteration m, an ensemble of P \"particles\" is generated such that each particle has the initial state at time t 0 drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with mean X (m\u22121) and variance a (m\u22121) \u03c3 X , where 0 < a < 1 is a \"cooling factor\". The initial state vector for particle i is denoted by X(t 0 , i) = N (X (m\u22121) , a (m\u22121) \u03c3 X ). These states are also used to set X F (t 0 , i) which define the posterior distribution at time t 0 . Analogously, each particle i has an initial parameter vector \u03b8(t 0 , i) = N (\u03b8 (m\u22121) , b (m\u22121) \u03c3 \u03b8 ), where 0 < b < 1 is another cooling factor. The inference proceeds by numerically integrating the model from these initial conditions, such that the predicted vector state for each particle i at time t n is obtained from the following distribution, X P (t n , i) = f (X F (t n\u22121 , i), \u03b8(t n\u22121 , i)). Based on these predictions, a weight W (t n , i) is assigned to each particle i, such that",

Finally, the SEIIR model is used here as a core model within the Iterative Ensemble Kalman Filter (IEnKF) framework (see Methods).

After using IEnKF to estimate the values of all model parameters for the first window, the factor Re city is calculated at its center. These parameters and all populations obtained by numerical integration of Eqs. (3)-(8), except for E 0 and D 0 , as previously explained, are used as initial guesses for the second window. The same procedure is then repeated for the third and subsequent windows. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Figure 2a shows the normalized moving averages of bus validations of individuals that got COVID-19, including healthcare workers. We note that healthcare workers that came into contact with SARS-CoV-2 during the studied period did not reduce their bus rides as much as other passengers. In addition, their normalized moving averages of bus validations are getting closer to each other again as the economic reopening progresses. The inset of Fig. 2a shows the daily bus validations, which gradually started to increase in the economic reopening. Figures 2b and 2c show the daily numbers of cases and deaths, respectively, following the same previous normalization and stratification. The representativeness of the dataset of COVID-19 confirmed cases on buses is assessed comparing the daily numbers of infectious individuals within those vehicles and in the entire city, as shown in Fig. 3. The daily number of infectious individuals is computed taking into account the 14 days that the individuals remain infectious, i.e., each individual who tested positive for COVID-19 counts up to 14 times, once per day, for the infectious curve. Figures 3a and 3b show the daily numbers regarding all infectious passengers and those infectious passengers who are healthcare workers, respectively. Similarly, the daily numbers of infectious individuals and infectious healthcare workers of the entire city are shown in Figs. 3c and 3d, respectively. While the first and second waves of the epidemic can be clearly identified in both curves shown in Fig. 3a (infectious passengers) and Fig.3c (infectious individuals), only highly attenuated peaks during the second wave period can be visualized in the corresponding curves for healthcare workers, as shown in Figs. 3b and 3d. We conjecture that the explanation for this behavior may be twofold. First, due to the high contagion of healthcare workers during the first wave, this group of people may have achieved a large percentage of immunity, as compared to the rest of the population. Second, efficient Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) became more available in hospitals after the first wave. The results in",

We now proceed with the comparison between contact tracing and compartmental models. In practical terms, this is achieved by upscaling d CCsout to the numerical values obtained for Re city during the early period of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, before the restrictions of isolation and social distancing imposed by the State Government took effect. Considering Eqs. (1) and (10), we use the relation \u03c7 d CCs out = \u03c8Re city and the numerical values of d CCs out , \u03c8 and Re city on the day that corresponds to the maximum of Re city during the first wave (April 8, 2020) to calculate \u03c7 \u2248 37. This constant combined with the values of \u03c8 from the inference with the compartmental model, and the values of d CCs out from the contact tracing, both calculated for all time windows, are then used to obtain the entire curve of Re bus = (\u03c7/\u03c8) d CCs out (see the time evolution of \u03c7/\u03c8 in Fig. S3 of theSupplementary Information). The value of \u03c7 can be understood as the product of two factors, \u03c7 = \u03c7 rr \u03c7 ru . Assuming the equality between the proportions of CCs in the pairs of infectious and exposed passengers with existing and missing values of \u03c4 ij , we estimate \u03c7 rr \u2248 1/0.586 \u2248 1.70 as a balance factor for possible missing CCs. The value of the remaining factor \u03c7 ru \u2248 21.76 expresses the sub-notification of the confirmed cases as well as our lack of knowledge on the transmission from reported to unreported infectious passengers, for which the factor (1 \u2212 \u03b1)/\u03b1 could be a lower bound (seeFig. S2of the Supplementary Information for a sensitivity analysis of the model with parameter \u03b1), approximately between 5 and 9[32]. In an entirely similar fashion, by considering only reported infectious passengers that can be identified as healthcare workers, we can estimate their particular effective reproduction number as Re health = (\u03c7/\u03c8) d CCs out health with the same upscaling factor \u03c7/\u03c8 used for all infectious passengers and d CCs out health is the average of the vertices outdegrees for healthcare workers.",

Furthermore, Re health remained undetectable even in the beginning of the second wave, in contrast to Re bus and notwithstanding the increase of the number of daily bus validations of healthcare workers, as shown inFig. 2a. As shown in the inset ofFig. 5, the maximum ratio Re health /Re bus occurred soon after the lockdown period, since the hospitals were still overloaded due to the peak of cases at the beginning of May and the new daily infections were low in the beginning of the reopening period. We emphasize that the complement of Re health , due to non-healthcare workers, behaves similar to Re bus .IV. CONCLUSIONSIn summary, two epidemiological models have been used in this work to understand the transmission on public transportation during the COVID-19 outbreak in Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1, Brazil. Whilst the compartmental model accounts for the transmission in the entire city (macroscopic scale), the contact tracing model has been used to estimate the transmission inside city buses (microscopic scale) through the concept of CCs. Both models were fed with real data of bus validations and of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Our results",

For healthcare workers, we highlight an unexpected emergence of a single peak in the daily numbers of infectious individuals within buses and in the entire city, which contrasts to the first and the second waves of COVID-19. We conjecture that the explanation for this behavior may be the lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in hospitals during the first wave or the herd immunity of healthcare workers during the second wave.

However, as depicted, a value of Re city around 2 in the beginning of April still indicated a rapid and exponential-like increase of the epidemic in the city of Fortaleza. A steep decrease in Re city was then observed and that effective reproduction number dropped below the critical value 1 around May 5, 2020, when the Government decreed lockdown.

            "text": "In recent decades, young adults aged 18-24 are found to be gaining weight more rapidly than their prior generations [1] . Indeed, weight gain is prominent among those aged 18-35 in most developed countries. For instance, 35% of U.S. young adults and 27.9% of the Australian young population are shown to be obese [2] [3] [4] . Moreover, the Population Health Survey [5] revealed that 50% of Hong Kong adults aged 15-84 were either overweight or obese. Particularly in populations under 30-years-old, insufficient intake of wholegrains, fruits, and vegetables, but abundant intake of discretionary foods, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, are ubiquitous [6, 7] . In addition, in the transition from attending high school to beginning their employment, young adults also have greater food intake outside of the home [8] , inevitably leading to higher energy intake from convenience foods, alcoholic beverages, take-out food, and other high-density, low-nutrient foods [9] . This trend is particularly alarming because a higher body mass index in early adulthood increases the risk of progressive metabolic syndrome by 21 times for men and 27 times for women in the subsequent 15 years [10] . Therefore, establishing healthy eating habits is considered a sustainable and highly effective strategy for health maintenance and the prevention of chronic illnesses [11, 12] .",

            "text": "In Hong Kong, the government established a committee to create a strategic plan to reduce dietary salt and sugar intake in the Hong Kong population [13] . The work of the committee included public education to promote awareness of healthy eating and transferring knowledge about balanced diets [14] . Indeed, acquisition of nutrition knowledge plays a pivotal role in positively changing people's eating behavior [15] . Younger adults, however, are found to lack skills in planning, purchasing, preparing, and cooking healthy meals at home, and tend to select nutritionally-inadequate pre-packaged foods [16] . Younger adults also seem to constitute a group that is lacking family support in consuming healthy meals, while simultaneously also not ready to assume responsibility for eating healthfully [17, 18] . Self-efficacy constitutes the essential determinant to promote nutrition behavior and education is found effective to increase one's self-efficacy [19] . Younger working groups have been shown to require innovative nutrition education to make healthy food choices [19] . Recently, nutrition education has radically transformed from descriptive to interactive modalities, i.e., from face-to-face to instant messaging, social media, the Internet, and mobile applications (apps) [20] [21] [22] [23] . Indeed, rapid advancements in technology have markedly shifted health communication in a timely, interactive, and interdisciplinary direction. This integration of knowledge transfer about healthy eating with mobile apps is essential for those technology-immersed younger population [24] . Healthy eating promotion, if conducted with appropriate technology applications, facilitates users to acquire information flexibly in time, pace, and place. Another major advantage of technology application is its specific fit to individual needs, and it allows reflection [22] . To promote healthy eating efficaciously, nutrition knowledge necessitates both education and reflection [25] . Through reflective practices, positive changes in eating habits can be expected [25] .",

She appreciated that the online food report and nutrient report allowed her to visualize the calorie intake and nutrient intake of each meal. For foods other than pre-packaged foods, the dietary reports facilitated User A to understand the nutrient content of her food choices. She stated that the dietary monitoring app made her reflect on three important points about healthy eating: first, she should not eat too much in a single meal; second, the intake limits of calories were determined by physical activity level; and third, food intake should be distributed over several meals. User B remarked that she was not previously aware of her nutrient intake, and that during the whole intervention process, she paid more attention to calorie intake, vitamin intake, and calcium intake in each meal. User B agreed that the whole intervention process was useful because she knew that there were nutrient labels in pre-packaged food and the nutrient information was easily found in pre-packaged food. User B stated that he had previously ignored nutrient values of food from different meals in her daily life, but that they contributed to more daily food consumption. Therefore, User B found the entire intervention process beneficial to her understanding of healthy eating. User C also remarked that the online food report and online nutrient report revealed important, and often obscured, nutritional truth. In other words, even if a food appears to be healthy, their consumption should still not exceed the recommended level, such as in the case of white rice. User C reflected that she understood that the calorie limit could be related to physical activities when she reviewed his online reports during the intervention process. In addition, before she used the dietary recording system, she thought that a high sugar level was limited to those foods that tasted sweet. After the whole intervention process, however, she knew how to avoid high sugar content foods or to choose foods with a lower glycemic index.",

Younger adults are also comfortable with technology and social media. Since their priorities in obtaining knowledge tend towards efficiency and convenience, they found this new concept of healthy eating promotion to be an appropriate way to acquire the skills to make good food choices and establish a balanced diet. Indeed, this modality of learning presents no constraints in terms of scheduled time, transportation, and location. It is also expected that this project could probably be effectively applied to other age groups to assimilate acquired nutrition knowledge with an eating plan. The process of behavioral feedback also encourages users to identify and solve problems on their own [25] . Through repeated reflective learning via behavioral feedback, other users in the community may find it easy to connect eating problems with food choices, and to implement practical dietary advice that follows recommended guidelines of healthy eating.",

The current study indicated that the younger adults attending the nutrition seminar only, and those attending the nutrition seminar and using the dietary monitoring app, both improved their nutrition knowledge. However, having the dietary monitoring app for the purpose of dietary reflection made the younger adults more capable of matching food products to food categories, choosing healthy foods, and selecting foods to reduce health problems or risk of diseases. Healthy eating knowledge promoted to younger adults should also be unique to address their specific food access and dietary inquiries. Indeed, their individual problems in dietary patterns should be channeled to them as feedback to take effective actions. Their eating problems should be easily traced in their dietary records and dietary analyses, and immediate corresponding modifications should be made in their meal plans. To facilitate such interactive learning, dietary monitoring apps with reflective feedback are able to provide effective awareness in younger adults for changing their lifestyle in terms of healthy eating. It is found that younger adults' self-reflection is feasible with eDietary Portal. The eDietary Portal empower younger adults to take control of identifying their individual eating problems and correcting their eating problems through proper food choices.",

Participants may find it easy to avoid simple sugar, which is easily identified by a sweet taste. For example, they could eat less sweet-tasting foods and choose beverages without a sweet taste. Salt content in food, however, could be more difficult to avoid. Foods prepared at home could be controlled by adding less salt, or soy sauce or oyster sauce instead. It is also worth noting that salt is invisible. Indeed, foods served in restaurants could not be assessed for sodium content by the name of dishes, ingredients, or photographs of foods. This is an especially concerning issue because younger adults tend to dine-out comparatively more frequently in their daily life. This may be the primary reason that participants found it easy to increase their fruit and vegetable consumption and avoid sugar intake, but not to choose less salt in their foods.",

Moreover, the increase of dietary fiber intake, with a significant decrease in carbohydrate consumption, indicated a shift of food choice from starchy foods to whole grain foods. An improvement in whole grain consumption was supported in both groups, and the participants using the dietary monitoring app improved their whole grain consumption to a significantly greater extent than those in the control group. This demonstrated that participants obtained more awareness in adjusting their foods to whole grain food during the dietary monitoring process. Through the online reports, participants in the experimental group identified food choices with more dietary fiber and could continue to consume relatively more of those foods. This effect is attributed to the behavioral feedback of the reflection process, in which participants identified their eating problems by reviewing the online reports [30] .",

This is attributable to the fact that research is commonly designed with fruit and vegetable consumption as an integrated outcome measurement; if separately taken into account; however, fruit consumption is usually higher than vegetable consumption [40] .

This observation was in accordance with Abdel-Megeid et al.'s [41] findings and supported the assertion that vegetable consumption is comparatively more difficult to promote among younger adults.

In addition, this project used a mobile app as the means to promote healthy eating. Consequently, participants who were more familiar with mobile technology and more accustomed to using apps may benefit more from the intervention. On the other hand, participants who may have a lower education background, lower technology literacy, less experience in using mobile apps, lower income, and work more hours per week may encounter difficulties in using this intervention for dietary reflection. However, the project team believes that, with the greater coverage of smart phone applications in the population and the well-equipped infrastructure of 4G and 5G technology in the near future, the overall population will become increasingly familiar with mobile apps. Regarding the major benefits of saving transportation time and recording dietary records entirely according to one's own schedule, mobile apps in healthy diet promotion could be effectively generalized to other age groups, such as patients with chronic diseases, as well as elderly and minority groups, which may have relatively less access to dietary knowledge. In addition, health care providers can use these dietary monitoring apps in a highly cost-effective manner. The heathy eating tips implemented in this research contributed greatly to its success in good compliance with the dietary monitoring process. With no systematic encouragement in sending healthy eating tips, the significant results achieved by younger adults during the dietary monitoring process could be discounted. As the implementation of the dietary recording process required health educators to work along with the participants, the applications of eDietary Portal as dietary monitoring may limit scalability to a larger population to be conducted at the same time.",

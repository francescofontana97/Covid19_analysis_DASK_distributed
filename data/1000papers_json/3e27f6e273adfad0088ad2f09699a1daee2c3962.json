The emergence has affected every aspect of health care, including the delivery of standard radiotherapy to patients with cancer. Those patients was facing disruption because of concerns about their susceptibility to the serious risks of COVID-19, travel restrictions, and the shortage of personnel, beds and personal protective equipment, and it has been reported that many cancer patients in hospitals of Wuhan got into such difficulties, so the number of patients receiving radiotherapy significantly decreased during the pandemic. [4] [5] The radiotherapy center of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (RHWU) was shut down on January 24, and reopened until March 9, 2020.Thus, many patients were unplanned interrupted of radiotherapy during this period. Our survey of 140 consecutive patients in RHWU from March 9 to June 30, 2020, summarizes the clinical characteristics and outcome of these patients whose radiotherapy interrupted for 45 days or longer.

Including lung(n = 26[18.6%]), breast(n = 21[15%]), head and neck cancer (n = 24[17.1%]), or gastrointestinal (n = 25[17.9%])or gynecological cancer (n = 17[12.1%]). During the pandemic, 76 patients stayed at home without any cancer treatments. Twenty-six patients took traditional Chinese medicine, 12 took oral chemotherapy or molecular targeted therapy medications, 10 continued radiotherapy in other hospitals. 87 (62.1%) patients have returned to our center. The result indicated that stage IV was associated with 2poor prognosis compared with stage I-III. But the delivered radiation dose was not associated with disease prognosis (Table1).After 5 months of follow-up, 16 patients including nine females and seven males were died (11.4%), age from 40 to 77 years old. 11 were diagnosed with stage IV cancer and five with stage III cancer. 14 (10.0%) died of cancer and 2 (1.4%) died of COVID-19.Suboptimal delivery of radiotherapy (including delays, interruptions or omissions) has been demonstrated to compromise both local control and survival, especially for stage IV cancer patients. Other anti-tumor therapies (oral chemotherapy, endocrinotherapy or molecular targeted therapy) maybe improve the situation. Salvage radiotherapy was practicable, such as weekend treatments or increased number of daily fractions; increased dose per fraction; delivering extra fractions[6]. Balancing the risks of infection and subsequent mortality with the increased risks of cancer mortality derived from delaying treatment is of utmost importance,to date,many cancer centers have shared their strategies and experiences,which were effective in protecting the patient and staff from infection.[7][8][9] Further follow-up may clearly demonstrate the consequence of treatment interruption on local control and survival of cancer patients.",

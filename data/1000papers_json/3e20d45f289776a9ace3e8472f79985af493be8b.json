            "text": "The burden of mental illness for young people across the world is growing in magnitude [1] , now more than ever [2] , and especially as they find themselves disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic [3] . A 2015 meta-analysis revealed a significant global prevalence of anxiety (6.5%) and depressive disorders (2.6%) among children and adolescents [4] . In Canada, the diagnostic rate of anxiety disorders in youth (ages 12-24 years old) doubled in 2018 compared to 2011 (12.9 vs. 6.0%, respectively) [5] . Anxiety is manifested in many forms, with comorbidity between anxiety disorders [6, 7] and/or depression very common [8] . Upwards of 50% of adult mental health disorders have their onset during adolescence [1] , making timely and effective intervention key to lessening the burden of illness over the long term [9, 10] . The need for context-specific understandings of the mental health experiences of adolescents has been identified as a one of the major gaps in global research [11] . Measures such as scales and questionnaires are necessary to quantify anxiety, yet these approaches risk not adequately reflecting the lived experience of psychological distress across individuals and settings [12] . Living with a mental illness, including anxiety [13] and depression [14] , is a complex, biopsychosocial experience that is unique to each person and embedded in their contexts and lived worlds. Given the breadth and complex intricacies of mental illness experiences, a qualitative approach presents several advantages [15] . Our research aimed to amplify the voices of youth living with anxiety and highlight salient metaphors (narrative and visual) of the lived experience of anxiety that make knowledge more available and applicable to others.",

Hermeneutic phenomenology attempts to make sense of real-life experiences as they are lived by individuals in their social worlds, recognizing that these understandings are always interpreted and contingent [65] . The goal of hermeneutic phenomenology is to describe the meaning of an experience, including what was experienced, and how it was experienced [66] . As guiding concepts, hermeneutic phenomenology is concerned with lived meaning-the way that a person experiences and understands their world as real and meaningful; and lifeworld-how that life is experienced in the context of being intertwined with the world [64, 67] . Van Manen's lifeworld includes four existentials-lived time (i.e., the ways individuals temporally experience their lifeworld), lived space (i.e., the ways people experience the spatial dimensions of their daily experiences, including feelings of being in place), lived body (i.e., the bodily experience of everyday life including how we feel, reveal, conceal, and share), and lived human relations (i.e., the relations we make and maintain) [68] .",

Participants experienced anxiety and other co-morbid conditions (e.g., depression) ranging from moderate to severe. As an exclusion criterion, youth who had a confirmed diagnosis of either obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were not included in the project as these disorders present differently with different symptoms. Overwhelmingly, participants stated that they felt they had lived with traits of anxiety for many years, prior to a specific diagnosis. We also interviewed parents/caregivers of youth participants. While not presented as part of the findings of this paper, the purpose was to explore their perspectives of parenting a youth with anxiety and its impact on the family.",

The first interview was also supplemented by asking youth participants to create an ecomap-a graphic portrayal of social relationships or networks of individuals or families, as well as places and activities [76] . Prior to asking youth questions about their experiences of living with an anxiety disorder, they were asked to draw nodes that represent people, activities, and places that are and have been a part of their lives. Youth were asked to indicate the degree of connection that they have with each person, activity, or place represented on the map (using lines, colours, or another means). Different types of lines and/or colours represented different types of connections. The ecomaps were used throughout the first interview to promote discussion. Additional interview strategies included the use of silence, the elicitation of examples, and probes to expand on something the participant had said [77] . When probing youth, great care was taken to ensure that the questions remained close to youth's experiences. At the end of the interview sessions, participants were given the opportunity to add questions to the interview guide. In one such case, a 13-year-old participant requested that we add the question \"what does anxiety look like in your head?\" to our interview guide. This metaphorical nature of this question generated a number of responses included in this paper; however, other metaphors were offered by participants unprompted.",

Photovoice is a participatory method that involves individuals taking photographs to document the issues most significant to them [78, 79] , as well as engaging in critical reflection and dialogue about those images [80] . As an arts-based method, photovoice embodies a phenomenological research design, offering a direct expression of lived experiences, through alternative (i.e., visual) means [81, 82] . For this project, photovoice did not take place in the group setting as is common. Rather, the researcher introduced photovoice to individual participants following their first research interview, who then worked on their individual photovoice project over the course of approximately four weeks, with the researcher checking in with them. A second individual open-ended interview was scheduled with youth participants, offering an opportunity for the researcher to follow up on the first interview and generate thick description of their lived experience. Also, in the second interview, the SHOWeD technique-as commonly used in photovoice [78] -was used by the researcher as a tool to generate discussion with each research participant as to the images they took and selected for the project. The technique consists of a series of questions posed to participants regarding their selected images including: What do you See here?; What is really Happening here?; How does this relate to Our lives?; Why does this problem/concern/strength Exist?; and What can we Do about it?

As informed by van Manen's method of data analysis [64] , all data emerging from the project (including interviews, ecomaps, field notes, and photographs) were included in the analysis. Data were read (and re-read) with attention to significant statements, sentences, or sentence clusters that stood out as thematic of the lived experience of youth with anxiety disorders. Through multiple analytic discussions with the first author, research team members, and research assistants, units of meaning were delineated and formed into thematic statements, and themes were extracted. Graphic data (i.e., ecomaps and photographs) helped to inform the themes emerging from the youth interview data, serving as graphical representations of the text-based findings, which contributed to a greater understanding of the experiences of youth [85] .",

For many youth participants, anxiety resulted in a cyclical pattern that took up a nificant amount of time. For instance, a participant described living with anxiety as b akin to listening to a \"bad record on repeat\". Time factored into the ways they descr and conceptualized both their symptoms and experiences of living with anxiety. Fo stance, many participants submitted photographs of clocks on the wall and alarm cl as a literal description time as a source of anxiety. However, for many other youth, missions of clocks were more metaphorical, to represent how anxiety informed and trolled their experience with lived time, as well as how their lived time informed anxiety. Other youth submitted examples of pacing as a literal and metaphorical des tion of their experience of lived time. This emphasis on time was something we inco rated into some of our knowledge translation products, in one instance having a tic clock as the background noise to our film Can't You See I'm Struggling [87] .",

For instance, a participant described living with anxiety as being akin to listening to a \"bad record on repeat\". Time factored into the ways they described and conceptualized both their symptoms and experiences of living with anxiety. For instance, many participants submitted photographs of clocks on the wall and alarm clocks as a literal description time as a source of anxiety. However, for many other youth, submissions of clocks were more metaphorical, to represent how anxiety informed and controlled their experience with lived time, as well as how their lived time informed their anxiety. Other youth submitted examples of pacing as a literal and metaphorical description of their experience of lived time. This emphasis on time was something we incorporated into some of our knowledge translation products, in one instance having a ticking clock as the background noise to our film Can't You See I'm Struggling [87] .",

There are only a few studies that have utilized a similar phenomenological approach to capture existential aspects of the illness experience for youth with anxiety, namely Woodgate et al.'s (2020) study of the sense of self in anxious youth [89] and Leone et al.'s (2013) study of anxious youth in high school [90] . Put together, the previous studies attest to the pervasiveness of anxiety across several, if not all, dimensions of youth's lives, consistent with the findings of this study. The majority of the literature continues to be specific, for instance, social anxiety and its environmental (e.g., schools, clinics) and relational (e.g., peers, parents) aspects [91, 92] . The adoption of an existential lens, used in conjunction with evidence-based measures, can provide access to the lived space, time, body, and relationships of youth with anxiety across populations and contexts. Visual art methods, such as photovoice, can aid the adoption of an existential lens as they are designed to align with a context and support a \"re-visioning\" of an experience [93, 94] , moving beyond the act of simply sharing to a more comprehensive shaping of youth's mental illness experiences [95] . The photographs that emerged from this study were a form of metaphor making, meaningful on their own while also complementing the patient's illness narratives.",

Photovoice was especially helpful in conveying the often-intangible emotional aspects tied to their experiences of their lived space, echoing both feelings of powerlessness and resilience. This study's use of photovoice has methodological implications as it exemplifies how visual art can be used as a metaphor to contribute to spatial gestalts that are a more accurate and complete representation of the participant's lived space. Spatial metaphors are a key window for researchers, the public, and healthcare providers to understand the lived world of youth with anxiety, which can highlight ways to make spaces \"safer\" and inversely identify triggers and targets for therapy.",

The diversity and range of youth's embodied experiences captured by narrative metaphors is irreducible; despite having a common diagnosis, this has important implications for healthcare providers. Although quantifiable and observable measures, such as questionnaires and scales, need to inform the assessment of anxiety in youth, they are insufficient when used alone and do not always capture the high level of comorbidity (e.g., between anxiety disorders, with depression) [96] . When used properly, metaphors can be a valuable tool for youth to convey what their experience is really like and can better inform an assessment of the impact of anxiety in their everyday life.",

This two-fold perspective on relationships resulted in youth carefully manoeuvring their social world, trying to balance risk with benefits. Additionally, many youth found themselves feeling alone, sometimes even in the presence of others. Metaphors can be a valuable way for youth to share their experiences with others, fostering connection and understanding, especially if the experience of anxiety is outside of that individual's frame of reference. It is important to recognize that the social world of youth with anxiety is evolving and influenced by their many factors, including their internal state and external factors. Only recently have youth voiced their own experiences of the social and emotional aspects related to their social fears and anxieties [91] . For this reason, asking a young person how they want to be supported in that moment in time (e.g., silence in companionship, distraction, alone time) and recognizing that different forms of relations may be preferred (e.g., online groups, pet therapy) may be most beneficial. Time spent in nature has also been identified as a key element for young people in their coping and management [97] .",

Communication in healthcare is a characterized by cross-cultural interactions (e.g., age, social class, professional background) [31] and an epistemic imbalance between the patient and the healthcare provider [99] . Culture denotes the cognitive schemata a group of people use to make sense of new information [100] . Diagnostic tools and the use of language within such tools may be inadequate in actively drawing out from young people the full extent of their lived experience. When used in healthcare discussions, explanatory metaphors aim to cue shared cultural models in order to serve as a \"bridge between expert and public understandings\" [25] . Every mental illness experience, especially anxiety [13, 89] and depression [12, 101, 102] , is unique to the individual and embedded in their context. For this reason, a clinician's use of metaphor should be tailored to the patient's context and individual characteristics (e.g., cultural values, background, illness type and stage) [17, 31, 36] . By attending and responding to a patient's chosen metaphors, a clinician stands to gain a deeper understanding of the many languages of mental illness and, in particular, their patient's language. In addition to being mindful of the language in patient interactions, there is also a need to further educate the public around conceptualizations of mental health, particularly youth's mental health literacy regarding symptoms of depression and anxiety [103] [104] [105] . In order to effect change, knowledge from health research must be articulated in a manner that makes it available and applicable [106, 107] . Photovoice as a form of visual metaphor is a valuable method of making inherently personal experiences of illness accessible to others and enabling to rewrite social attitudes and beliefs about mental health [56, 108, 109] .",

Metaphors helped to provide insights into youth's varied perspectives of their lived space, lived body, lived time, and lived relationships. Through the use of qualitative, arts-based research methods, youth were afforded the opportunity to express their existential challenges metaphorically. As Galasi\u0144ski notes, a greater presence of qualitative research is needed in the areas of mental health research and psychiatry, considering qualitative research can result in the understanding of the meanings exchanged in the diverse contexts of social life, as well as offer insight into the complexity of clinical communication, the here-and-now of the clinical encounter [110] . We suggest that departing from the literal use of words through metaphors and utilizing qualitative, art-based methods can offer new opportunities for improving the therapeutic conversations and interactions clinicians have with youth experiencing mental illness [111] .",

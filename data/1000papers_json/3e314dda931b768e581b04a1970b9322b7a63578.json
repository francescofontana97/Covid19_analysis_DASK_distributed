That is problematic because improvements in behaviour require improvements in structure. This paper considers how the public policy implementation literature could improve the operational thinking skills required for designing policy structure for public sector models. A familiar model of a public health problem is used to illustrate the recommended approach. And an instructional training strategy is offered for teaching and learning to think operationally during the policy-design stage of modelling.

He said the solution was simple, 'Boil the oceans'. When asked how to boil the oceans, he responded, 'I'm a policy man. I let others worry about implementation'. Whatever its motivation, the remark is a fitting satiric reference to then-President Wilson and the prevailing political science paradigm that separated policy making from policy administration. The only social scientist ever elected to the presidency, Wilson (1887, pp. 209-210) had already laid the intellectual foundation for thinking that 'administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics' and that 'administrative questions are not political questions'. One of the most visible advocates of civil service reform during America's Progressive Era, he viewed 'the field of administration [as] a field of business removed from the hurry and strife of politics'.",

Among the first critics, Hargrove (1975) called implementation the 'missing link' in public policy analysis. Minogue (1983) remarked that a distinction between making policy and executing it would be 'absurd' to modern social scientists. Hill (1993, p. 235) Systems Research and Behavioral Science Syst. Res. 27, 425^442 (2010) Published online in Wiley InterScience (www.interscience.wiley.com) DOI:10. 1002/sres. 1039 articulated the new view that policy ends are often reshaped by administrative means: 'What [the Wilsonian view] was prone to disregard was the extent to which [public administration] would tend to transform policy, often fundamentally. Implementation must be seen as part of policy-making'. And Bardach (2005, p. 33) supports the normative implications of the new perspective: 'Even the best policy planners do not get all the details right in the design stage. They should therefore allow room for policy implementers to improve on the original design'.",

The performance of those programs generally fell short of the promises made by the president and his congressional coalition. 2 During the 1970s, some researchers highlighted a common denominator in the disappointing policy outcomes: poor implementation (cf., Williams and Elmore, 1976; Nakamura and Smallwood, 1980) .",

In the second edition of Implementing Public Policy, Hill and Hupe (2009) take several pages to develop a working definition. After reviewing variants in the public policy literature, they defer to Ferman (1990) and settle on wording that is indisputable but vague: implementation is 'what happens between policy expectations and perceived policy results'. Such a definition may be useful for the scope of their book, as it underscores the breadth and significance of the concept. For our purposes, however, more precision is needed, and we opt for the simple definition offered by Mazmanian and Sabatier (1983, p. 1) : 'Implementation is the carrying out of a basic policy decision' made by government officials exercising formal authority.",

            "text": "Both the broad and narrow definitions of implementation imply a sequence in the policy process. Howlett, Ramesh and Perl (2009) refer to five stages in that process: agenda setting, formulation, decision-making, implementation and evaluation. The implementation stage occurs after a policy is considered, formulated, and authoritatively adopted. 3 Studying the implementation stage per se has emerged as the province of academic political scientists. They identify and explain the origin of obstacles that lead to disappointing policy outcomes. In contrast, analysts trained in public policy graduate schools use an eclectic, multi-disciplinary research approach to implementation issues. The challenge for the policy analyst is to reduce the likelihood of problems during the implementation stage by better planning during the formulation stage. 1 Limiting the scope of this paper to the public policy literature is not intended to deny the potential of other disciplines (e.g. operations research) to contribute to improvements in SD public policy modelling. 2 The gap between promise and performance is a theme in a special issue of The Public Interest (http://www.nationalaffairs.com/doclib/ 20060404_NUMBER034WINTER1974.pdf). A more sympathetic treatment of the Great Society is provided by one of its architects in the October 1999 issue of The Washington Monthly, (http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9910.califano.html). 3 These processes are not one-way streets; iteration and feedback occur. The policy feedback perspective emerged at least 75 years ago when E.E. Schattschneider (1935) observed that 'new policies create new politics'. Policy feedback is now an important strand within the tapestry of public policy research (cf., Pierson, 1993 , Angland 1999 . The feedback perspective has obvious appeal to system dynamicists, but that is not the focus of this paper.",

That requires building and testing an explanatory model. In the second stage, the challenge is to design and test policies that alleviate the problem; that is improve the dynamic performance of the system. That requires building a policy structure (another 'model' if you will) that can be integrated with the explanatory model. Forrester made this distinction forty years ago and reiterated it recently. 'First . . . generate a model that creates the problem. Only if we understand the processes leading to the difficulties can we hope to [secondly] restructure the system so that the internal processes lead in a different direction' (Forrester, 1969, p. 113 '. 5 For our purposes, the key term in Forrester's second-stage description is 'restructure'. At the policy-design stage, the explanatory model should be modified by adding stock-and-flow feedback structure that implements decision rules specifying when the new policy will become operational, how it will work, and what will happen over time to improve the performance of the system. 6 The SD literature reiterates this point. Richardson and Pugh (1989, p. 332) stress that 'policy improvement . . . involves the addition of new feedback links'. Ford (1999, p. 177 ) makes clear that adding new stock-and-flow structure is necessary 'to describe the details of policy implementation'. And Sterman (2000, p. 104) emphasizes that 'policy design . . . includes the creation of entirely new . . . structures and decision rules'.",

Different authors have emphasized different details in the modelling process, but there is a consensus about the key steps when developing an explanatory model: (1) specify the dynamic problem, (2) develop a hypothesis in the form of a model that explains the dynamics of the problem, and (3) analyse the model with various validation tests. Of course, this is an iterative process; for example what the modeller learns during analysis often necessitates revising the model (and the hypothesis it represents) and further analysis. Guidelines regarding policy modelling distinguish between testing policy parameters and adding policy structure, with the latter required for assessment of a specific policy option. 'what if' questions stemming from changes in parameters that might be the target of a policy intervention. Ideally, feasibility issues would still be discussed, at least in general terms. However, assessment of a particular policy idea would not be informed by modelling 'how it would work'.",

Fifty-one contain some form of model-based public policy analysis, but only 14 (27 per cent) have models exhibiting new policy structures and decision rules.

By limiting the survey to articles published in the SDR, we have overlooked SD model-based articles published elsewhere. In particular, a survey of journals devoted to public sector issues might yield a higher percentage of articles containing policy structure. Another reason for caution is that mistakes could have been made during the categorization process.

It helps a modeller estimate the potential impact of a general strategy for influencing key feedback loops in a problematic system, what Richardson and Pugh (1989, p. 322 ) call finding a 'leverage point' in the system. For example, in an epidemic model, a key parameter is the probability of infection when a contact occurs between an infectious person and a susceptible person. Simulation experiments with different parameter assumptions provide estimates of the potential payoff from a strategy aimed at lowering the infection probability as a means of weakening the problematic reinforcing loop that drives the infection rate. It is quite another task to estimate and evaluate the expected payoff from a particular policy. This second task requires modelling the process by which the policy eventually has its expected impact on the infection probability. Parameter testing begs the question of how something represented by a parameter in a model gets changed in the real world. Specifically, we need to know what combination of tangible resources, perceptual and attitudinal adjustments, institutional capacity and coordination, authoritative and voluntary cooperation, and process time are needed to implement changes that would produce the desired parameter value.",

Counteracting loop C1 is responsible for the decline in the Susceptible Persons stock, while the single reinforcing loop R is responsible for growth in all the other stocks. The intervening loops C2 and C3 reflect first-order delay assumptions, causing the Exposed and Infectious persons stocks to fall after rising. The main story line is the battle for dominance between loops C1 and R. Structure-behaviour tests reveal that loop R is dominant early in the simulation run, giving rise to exponential-like growth. Dominance eventually shifts to loop C1, however, and goal-seeking behaviour emerges. Figure 3 displays the base-case simulation pattern of all four stocks over a time horizon of 120 days. The simulation begins with a fixed population of 1000 susceptible persons and zero exposed, infectious and recovered persons. Other parameter assumptions: the contact rate per infectious person is three per day, the probability of infection is 0.25, the incubation period is 5 days, and the recovery period is 7 days. The initial equilibrium is disturbed on day 15, when an exogenous shock injects 10 infected persons into the Infectious Persons stock. The resulting behaviour is s-shaped decline for the stock of Susceptible Persons and (almost) a mirror image s-shaped growth for the final destination stock: Removed Persons. The middle stocks -Exposed and Infectious -rise and fall in smaller s-shaped patterns, and their accumulations are responsible for delays that produce the slight asymmetry between the Susceptible and Removed stocks. (The Removed total eventually rises above 1000 due to the exogenous infected persons, but not all 1010 get infected.)",

The public health laboratory that serves my jurisdiction has linked to clinical laboratories and provided training on the use of SARS tests, biosafety, specimen collection, packing and shipping, and rule-out testing 45. Public health laboratories in my state have computerized record keeping to help with data transmission, tracking, reporting of results to patients and facilities, and analysis during an epidemic 46. My jurisdiction has determined how to assess and document the spread and impact of disease throughout the population, including special populations at risk (such as health care workers and first responders), during a SARS epidemic, including enhancements to routine surveillance 48. My jurisdiction's epidemiology staff, in cooperation with other public health agencies, has the capacity to investigate clusters of SARS cases, to determine how disease is being transmitted, to trace and monitor contacts, to implement and monitor quarantine measures, and to determine whether control measures are working 49. My jurisdiction has plans for educating health-care providers about recognition and reporting of SARS, about the current case definition, and about sources of current information on all aspects of SARS S&M Framework Concept: Resources of Constituency Groups 5. I know whether my state allows hospitals and other licensed healthcare institutions to use temporary facilities for provision of medical care in the event of a public health emergency 11. My jurisdiction has identified key stakeholders responsible for development and implementation of specific components of the SARS epidemic plan, including enforcement of isolation, quarantine, and closure and decontamination of premises 16. My jurisdiction has identified an overall authority in charge of coordinating different medical personnel groups during an epidemic 21. I am familiar with the required protocol for securing needed emergency health-care services and supplies during a public health emergency 22. My jurisdiction has identified ways to augment medical, nursing, and other health-care staffing to maintain appropriate standards of care during an epidemic 23. My jurisdiction has identified ways to augment public health laboratory, epidemiology and disease control staffing to meet emergency needs and in the event public health workers are affected by an epidemic 24. My jurisdiction has a process to recruit and train medical volunteers for provision of care and vaccine administration during a public health emergency 25. My jurisdiction has identified alternate facilities where overflow cases from hospitals and well persons needing quarantine away from home can be cared for and has developed processes with Emergency Medical Services to assess, communicate, and direct patients to available beds SD models of public policy problems. Implementation assumptions should be discernible in stock-and-flow policy structure. However, policy structure in public policy models is the exception rather than the rule. More often than not, public policy analysis is limited to the study of parameter changes in a model. And that is problematic because improvements in systemic behaviour require improvements in systemic structure.",

In addition, AHRQ offers a problematic example of a federal emergency medical treatment law that could actually hinder implementation of a local isolation policy. 12 Despite the simple example offered in this paper, prospects for authorization, funding, and effective operational capacity for epidemic policies could pose implementation obstacles in some jurisdictions. The argument here is that, in such cases, policy design and assessment could benefit from insights that may be unique to the public policy literature.",

My jurisdiction's epidemic plan addresses the mechanics of how isolation and quarantine will be carried out, such as providing support services for people who are isolated or quarantined to their homes or temporary infirmary facilities and protection for workers providing these services 52. Community partners such as hospitals, EMS services, law enforcement agencies, health-care practitioners, environmental hygiene/remediation services, news media, schools and colleges know what part they are expected to play during an epidemic and are prepared to do so. AHRQ is an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In research results cited by AHRQ, only one-fourth of the hospitals in the state of Utah were willing to be designated as isolation facilities. AHRQ cites the Federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act as 'problematic' for isolation policies because of required medical screening examinations during specified emergencies.",

If that loop could be cut, the epidemic would end. The policy-design question, therefore, is 'How can loop R be eliminated, or at least weakened'? It is at this point that SEIR modellers begin to think in terms of reducing contacts between infectious and susceptible persons and/ or making those contacts safer (i.e. reducing the probability of infection when a contact occurs).",

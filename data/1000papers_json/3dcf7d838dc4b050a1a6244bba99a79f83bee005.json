It forms the first line of contact with the human cell. The FDA-approved drugs and phytochemicals from Indian medicinal plants were explored. Molecular docking and simulations of these molecules targeting the ACE2-Spike complex were performed. Rutin DAB10 and Swertiapuniside were obtained as the top-scored drugs as per the docking protocol. The MD simulations of ligand-free, Rutin DAB10-bound, and Swertiapuniside-bound ACE2-Spike complex revealed abrogation of the hydrogen bonding network between the two proteins. The principal component and dynamic cross-correlation analysis pointed out conformational changes in both the proteins unique to the ligand-bound systems. The interface residues, His34, and Lys353 from ACE2 and Arg403, and Tyr495 from the Spike protein formed significant strong interactions with the ligand molecules, inferring the inhibition of ACE2-Spike complex. Few novel interactions specific to Rutin-DAB10 and Swertiapuniside were also identified. The conformational flexibility of the drug-binding pocket was captured using the RMSD-based clustering of the ligand-free simulations. Ensemble docking was performed wherein the FDA-approved database and phytochemical dataset were docked on each of the cluster representatives of the ACE2-Spike. The phytochemicals identified belonged to Withania somnifera, Swertia chirayita, Tinospora cordifolia and Rutin DAB10, fulvestrant, elbasvir from FDA.",

            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as novel coronavirus, was discovered to have a high degree of pathogenicity, which resulted in a global pandemic, COVID-19 Wu et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2019) . The onset of COVID-19 was around December 2019 and by February 2021, this outbreak due to the SARS-CoV-2 has claimed more than 2.4 million lives and infected more than 109 million people worldwide (https:// covid 19. who. int/). The virus is spreading at an alarming rate and has become a serious concern for human health. The first sequence of the viral genome from an infected patient was released in January 2020 (World Health Organization 2020). The phylogenetic analysis reported in the literature suggests that this virus belonged to the positive single-stranded RNA viruses SARS family and hence was later on named as SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al. 2019; Lu et al. 2019; Gallagher and Buchmeier 2001; Paules et al. 2020) . The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus of betacoronavirus, which also includes the other viruses, namely MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and bat SARS related coronavirus to name a few (Lu et al. 2019; Gallagher and Buchmeier 2001; Paules et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2020) . Phylogenetic analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 was closely related to the bat SARS with a sequence identity of 93.1% for the S-glycoprotein (Spike) gene (Structure 2016). The genome size of the virus is approximately 29 Kb, which codes for nearly 30 proteins responsible for various functions. These 30 proteins include structural proteins, non-structural proteins, and accessory proteins. The virus encodes for four structural proteins, namely Spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N). Among the structural proteins, the Spike protein forms an important part of the virus as it is known to form the first line of contact with the human cells and control the downstream viral processes of attachment, fusion, and host cell entry.",

Zhou et al. (2020) through his studies showed that ACE2 is also a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 plays a major role in lowering the blood pressure by catalyzing the maturation of angiotensin (1-7) (a vasodilator, a peptide hormone) from angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor peptide) (Bader 2013; Donoghue et al. 2000; Hamming et al. 2007 ). ACE2 is present on the membranes of cells of most organs, namely lung type II alveolar cells, heart, kidney, endothelium, and intestine. Thus, the presence of ACE2 on different cells explains the damage caused to the different organs due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection Hamming et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2020; . The ACE2 protein comprises of three domains, the extracellular domain (residue range 18-470), the transmembrane domain (residue range 741-761), and the cytoplasmic domain (residue range 762-805) https:// www. unipr ot. org/ unipr ot/ Q9BYF1.

            "text": "The Spike protein comprises of two subunits S1 and S2 (Walls et al. 2020; Wrapp et al. 2020; Gui et al. 2017) . It exists as a heterotrimer to facilitate its binding to the ACE2 receptor. It has been reported that the Spike protein binds to ACE2 receptor on the surface of the human cell which is followed by cleavage of Spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2 subunit (Wrapp et al. 2020) . Based on the studies of SARS-CoV Spike protein, it was proposed that this cleavage is followed by the release of S1-ACE2 complex (Gui et al. 2017; Song et al. 2018; Kirchdoerfer et al. 2018; Yuan et al. 2017) . Following the release of the S1-ACE2 complex, S2 transits to a stable post-fusion state from the metastable pre-fusion state, an essential step for membrane fusion. Hence, the binding of the Spike protein to ACE2 forms a critical step for viral infection (Gui et al. 2017; Song et al. 2018; Kirchdoerfer et al. 2018; Yuan et al. 2017; Letko et al. 2020; Hoffmann et al. 2020) . Also, studies on the HeLa cell lines have shown that the cells which do not express ACE2 are not susceptible to viral inception . In vitro binding studies suggest good binding affinity at low nanomolar range between ACE2 and the receptor binding domain (RBD) (residues range 331 to 524 of Spike protein) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein . All these studies show that for binding to the ACE2 receptor on human cell the RBD domain of S1 subunit of Spike protein plays a key role. Within the RBD domain, the receptor binding motif (RBM) (residue range 438 to 506) directly interacts with the ACE2 receptor (Wrapp et al. 2020) . The interacting residues on the surface of the RBD domain are Lys417, Gly446, Tyr449, Tyr453, Leu455, Phe456, Ala475, Phe486, Asn487, Tyr489, Gln493, Gly496, Gln498, Thr500, Asn501, Gly502, and Tyr505 (Wrapp et al. 2020; Lan et al. 2020) . The interacting residues belonging to the ACE2 receptor are Gln24, Thr27, Phe28, Asp30, Lys31, His34, Lys35, Glu37, Asp38, Tyr41, Gln42, Leu79, Met82, Tyr83, Asn330, Lys353, Gly354, Asp355, Arg357, and Arg393. The various interactions formed between the residues of the ACE2 receptor and the RBD are shown in Fig. 1 . These interactions include 13 hydrogen bonds and 2 salt bridges which have been listed in Table 1 . Henceforth, the ACE2 receptor and RBD of Spike protein have been referred to as ACE2 and Spike protein, respectively.",

            "text": "All these atomistic details of the interactions confirm that the Spike protein and the ACE2 interaction is a must for the virus to enter the human cell. Studies have been reported earlier, wherein the ACE2-Spike complex of SARS-CoV-2 has been explored for druggable pockets (Patil et al. 2020; Smith and Smith 2020) . One of the works by Patil et al. in June 2020 reveals the interface of ACE2-Spike as one of the potential druggable pockets of this complex (Patil et al. 2020 ). There have been in silico studies which suggest that the ACE2-Spike complex proves to be a potential drug target for COVID19. One of such studies, performed by Smith et al. in February 2020, explores the conformational changes of the complex using molecular dynamics simulations (Smith and Smith 2020) , further targeting the different ensembles of ACE2-Spike interface with thousands of small molecules. This study enabled them to identify potential drugs that would block the ACE2 and Spike protein interactions by binding at the ACE2-Spike interface (Smith and Smith 2020) . Computational studies on receptor binding site prediction and ligand screening based on the ADMET properties have been performed earlier (Yadav et al. 2020) . The role of plant derivatives/phytochemicals from medicinally important plants and potential small molecules, against multiple SARS-CoV-2 drug targets have also been explored using the molecular docking and dynamics approaches Pandey et al. 2020; Sharma and Shanavas 2020; Fatoki et al. 2020; Jim\u00e9nez-Alberto et al. 2020; Liang et al. 2020; Meyer-Almes 2020) . The current study aims to find the inhibitors from the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) database and potential phytochemicals from Indian medicinal plants which can bind at the interface of ACE2 and RBD domain of the Spike protein through docking and simulation methods. The dataset of 150 phytochemicals consisted of molecules that belonged to the Indian medicinal plants known to treat respiratory disorders. Ocimum sanctum, Withania somnifera, Piper longum, Fig. 1 a ACE2 protein (red) and RBD domain of Spike protein (Green) where RBM is shown in light blue color. Interacting residues at the interface of two proteins are shown in ball and stick represen-tation. b Shows interface interacting residue with residue labels, d different types of interactions between ACE2 (below dotted line) and Spike protein (above dotted line) Tinospora cordifolia, Curcuma longa, Terminalia arjuna, Andrographis paniculata, Swertia chirayita, Azadirachta indica, and Aloe barbadensis were few of the plants that were considered in this study. The top-ranked molecules obtained through the docking of the ACE2-Spike complex (PDB ID: 6LZG) were Rutin DAB10 (FDA) and Swertiapuniside (Phytochemicals). In order to develop a deeper insight into the ligand interactions, ligand-free, Rutin DAB10-bound, and Swertiapuniside-bound ACE2-Spike complexes were further studied through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD simulations of the ligand-free ACE2-Spike (APO) complex were used as a control to observe changes occurring in the ligand-bound systems. The comparative analysis of the conformational and thermodynamics parameters revealed the crucial residues involved in stabilizing and destabilizing the ACE2-Spike complex. Further, to understand the flexibility of participating residues in ACE2-Spike complex, the simulation data of APO complex were subjected to clustering to obtain instances of various ensembles visited by this protein complex. These cluster representative structures were further used for ensemble docking of the FDA and phytochemical database of natural compounds. The pharmacokinetics properties of the identified phytochemicals were predicted in order to understand their potential use as drug candidates.",

The crystal structure has the 3D coordinates for the monomeric complex of human ACE2 receptor with the RBD domain of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2. This structure suggests similar binding mode of the Spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor as observed for other SARS-CoVs . The PDB was pre-processed by removing the coordinates of all the molecules except for the coordinates that belonged to the Spike protein and ACE2. This PDB was considered as APO form and was used for molecular docking and MD simulation studies. The methodology has been depicted in Fig. 2 . The molecular docking was performed for the screening of the FDA molecules database and phytochemical dataset. The two top-ranked drugs obtained from the docking of FDA-approved database and phytochemical dataset, respectively, on the APO form (PDB ID: 6LZG) of ACE2-Spike complex were further subjected to MD simulations. As a control, the MD simulations of APO form of the ACE2-Spike complex were also carried out. A total of 300 ns simulation data have been reported and analyzed. In addition to the docking of the experimental structure of ACE2-Spike complex (direct docking) and MD simulations of APO and ligand-bound complexes, an ensemble of different conformations of ACE2-Spike complex was generated by clustering of the APO's MD simulation data. The docking of the FDA-approved database and phtyochemical dataset was performed considering these different conformations of ACE2-Spike complex (ensemble docking). The details about each step have been given below.",

TIP3P water model was used to represent the water molecules with box size of 14 \u00c5. The solvated system was minimized using steepest descent method for 20,000 steps followed by the conjugate gradient method. Following minimization, the system employed the Langevin thermostat for gradually heating it to 300 K. In order to deal with the hydrogen restraints, the SHAKE algorithm was employed. After heating system up to 300 K, it was equilibrated at NPT conditions for 1 ns with pressure and temperature being 1 atm and 300 K, respectively. Each of the three systems was simulated in two replicates for 50 ns each. The parameters for the ligand in the ligand-bound simulations were derived from the antechamber module of Ambertools 17, and the force field used was general AMBER force field (GAFF) (Wang et al. 2004 (Wang et al. , 2006 .

            "text": "The conformational variation in the ACE2-Spike complex systems was measured based on three parameters, namely root mean square deviation (RMSD), principal component analysis (PCA), and dynamic cross-correlation (DCCM). The RMSD tells about how much a structure has deviated during the simulations from its initial structure. The RMSD of the C \u03b1 atoms for the ACE2 receptor and the Spike protein in each of the three systems has been calculated. The values plotted are the average of the RMSD values obtained in individual runs. In case of the ACE2 receptor, the APO and Rutin systems were observed to attain stability between 2 and 2.5 \u00c5. However, for the Swertia system the RMSD values were around 3.5 \u00c5. The RMSD values for the Spike protein, in all the three system, were observed to attain stability between 2 and 2.5 \u00c5. These RMSD plots have been included in the supplementary data as supplementary Figure S1 . The RMSD values plotted also suggest convergence of the simulations; hence, the analysis of this simulation data may be considered significant. Figure 5a shows a histogram plot for the RMSD of the APO, Rutin, and Swertia systems. From the figure, it is clear that the APO system showed the least deviation from the starting structure with a maximum population at an RMSD of ~ 2.1 \u00c5. The Rutin and Swertia systems showed RMSD deviation in the range of 2-3 \u00c5 and 2.5-4.5 \u00c5, respectively. Further, in order to see which of the protein was responsible for this deviation, histogram plots for RMSD of ACE2 and Spike protein, individually, were plotted. Figure 5b shows the histogram plot for RMSD of ACE2 protein for APO, Rutin, and Swertia system. The ACE2 protein in the APO system showed RMSD in the range of the 1-2.5 \u00c5. In case of the Rutin and Swertia systems, the RMSD values ranged within 1.7-2.5 \u00c5 and 2.5-4 \u00c5, respectively. Figure 5c shows the histogram plot for RMSD of the Spike protein for APO, Rutin, and Swertia system. The Spike protein in the APO system showed RMSD in the range of the 1-2.3 \u00c5. The RMSD of the Spike protein in the Rutin and Swertia systems were in the range of 1.6-3.1 \u00c5 and 1.6-2.6 \u00c5, respectively. The RMSD analysis shows that for the entire complex (ACE2-Spike) the maximum deviation was seen in the Swertia system and minimum in the APO system. The ACE2 protein deviated the most in the Swertia system. In the case of the Spike protein, the maximum deviation was seen in the Rutin system. Thus, both the ligands tend to induce significant conformation changes in the ACE2-Spike complex. In order to identify statistically significant conformational changes, the MD simulation data were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). The reaction coordinates for performing the PCA from the three systems were the 3D coordinates (x, y and z) of all the atoms except for hydrogen. The aim behind performing the principal component analysis was to identify the most dominant conformation that is attained by the ACE2-Spike complex in APO and ligand-bound simulations. This would further help in identifying the crucial residues responsible for these conformational changes. Figure S2 shows the normalized population distribution along the principal components (PC) 1 (A), PC 2 (B), and PC 3 (C). The principal component 1 sampled two significant populations; the population observed at eigenvalue 50 showed an overlap in the case of all the three systems (Figure S2A ). This suggests that the conformation captured in this population was observed in all the systems. However, the ligand-bound systems sampled one more population along the eigenvalue \u2212 50 \u00b1 10. The occurrence of this population in the case of APO was comparatively lower. Hence, it may infer that the conformations captured in this population were because of the presence of the ligand. In the case of the second and third principal components, the maximum population overlapped in all three systems. Even if two more distinct conformations were observed for Rutin simulations (Figure S2B ), the population was comparatively lower than the most populated conformation. The residue-wise RMSF captured by the first three principal components for ACE2 and the Spike protein is presented in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. Figure 6a represents the fluctuations captured by the principal component 1 for the residues of ACE2 receptor. In all the three systems, the region around 112 to 150 residue number showed significant variation. This variation was maximum in the case of the APO as compared to the ligand-bound systems. Figure 6d -f shows the variance captured by PC1 for the ACE2 residues from the ACE2-Spike complex for the APO, Rutin, and Swertia systems, respectively. The color code follows the red-green-blue (RGB) gradation corresponding to increase in variance/fluctuations. Figure 6d clearly depicts the highly varying residues within the range 112-150 of the ACE2, which can be seen in green color. This helical region lies in the core of the ACE2 receptor. Hence, variation in this region suggests conformational dynamics. It was observed that APO and Swertia showed similar motions for the residue range 112 to 150. However, in the case of the Rutin system, it was in the opposite direction. This suggests that the changes induced due to Rutin lead to a conformational change that is not native to the changes observed in the APO. The fluctuations over the entire ACE2 receptor appeared to reduce in the second principal component (Fig. 6b) . The fluctuations captured by the third component suggest that these occurred but were not present for a longer time in the simulation (Fig. 6c) . Figure 7a -c represents the fluctuations captured by the principal component 1, 2, and 3 for the residues of the Spike protein, respectively. Figure 7a clearly shows that the Rutin system fluctuated the most within the residue range 375 to 400 and 512 to 525. However, the former residue range fluctuated in the case of the APO and Swertia systems too, but the magnitude was less as compared to Rutin. The residue stretched from 350 to 400 appeared to be highly fluctuating as the variation was being captured with significant magnitude till the third principal component in all the three systems. The variation in the region from 512 to 525 residue reduced for the Rutin system in PC2 and PC3 (Fig. 7b, c) . Although some variation in this region was captured by PC2 for the other two systems, the PC1 captured variations have been projected on to the structure of the Spike protein as seen in Fig. 7d-f .",

The color gradation signifies the correlation values Fig. 6 Residue-wise RMSF of ACE2 receptor captured by principal components 1 (a), 2 (b), and 3 (c). Variations captured by PC1 shown on the structure of the ACE2 protein from the APO (d), Rutin (e), and Swertia (f) simulation systems ranging from \u2212 1 to 1. A value between \u2212 1 to 0 denotes that the molecular motions between the two residues have occurred in opposite direction. Conversely, a value between 0 to1 denotes that the molecular motions between the two residues have occurred in the same direction. The residues belonging to the Spike protein appeared to show more negative correlation in the Rutin and Swertia systems as compared to the APO system. The residue range 438-506 of the Spike protein, which is known to interact with the ACE2 receptor, appeared to be more negatively correlated in both the ligand-bound systems. In case of APO, the correlation values for the ACE2 residues were more negative as compared to the Rutin and Swertia systems. Thus, the correlation values between the residues of ACE2 and the Spike protein appeared to be distinct for the APO than the ligand-bound systems. This indicates that the type of molecular motions observed in the latter two might have occurred due to the presence of these ligands at the interface of the two proteins.",

            "text": "Free energy contribution in binding The binding efficiency of both the ligands to the ACE2-Spike complex was calculated using the MM-GBSA free energy of binding (Miller et al. 2012 ). The average free energy contribution made by the interface residues of ACE2 receptor and the Spike protein was calculated (Fig. 9 ). Lys31 and His34 showed a decrease in the free energy contribution in ACE2-Spike binding in the presence of the ligands in the Rutin and Swertia systems (Fig. 9a ). Lys35 and Asn330 were observed to have positive free energy values which infer unfavorable binding between ACE2 and the Spike protein. A contrasting behavior was observed in case of Glu37 and Lys353, as the Rutin bound system favored the ACE2-Spike binding more as compared to the other too. However, remaining all the ACE2 interface residues showed the free energy contribution either similar or better than APO as compared Figure 9b shows the comparison of average free energy contribution in binding by the residues of the Spike protein. Gln493 showed a decrease in free energy contribution in ACE2-Spike binding in the presence of either of the ligands. Contrastingly, the presence of Rutin DAB10 (Rutin system) showed increased free energy contribution by Lys417 in ACE2-Spike binding as compared to the other two systems. Rest of all the Spike protein residues were observed to have either similar or better free energy contribution for APO as compared to both the ligand systems. Hence, in order to understand the role of ligand in altering the binding efficiencies of the ACE2 and the Spike protein residues, they were compared for contributing in binding between the two proteins and the ligand molecule. Figure S3 depicts the average free energy contribution in binding obtained for the Rutin simulation system. In Figure S3A , the black and red bars represent the contribu-tion made by the residues of ACE2 in binding to the Spike protein and Rutin DAB10, respectively. Similarly, in Figure S3B the contribution made by the residues of the Spike protein in binding to the ACE2 protein (black) and Rutin DAB10 (red) has been depicted. It was observed that Asp30, His34, and Arg393 from ACE2 receptor showed more free energy contribution in binding to Rutin DAB10 rather than the Spike protein ( Figure S3A ). All the remaining residues appeared to contribute more in binding to the Spike protein as compared to Rutin DAB10. In case of the Spike protein residues, only Tyr453 was observed to contribute more in binding to the Rutin DAB10 in comparison with the ACE2 receptor ( Figure S3B ). The histogram for the free energy contribution in binding by Asp30, His34, and Arg393 of the ACE2 and Tyr453 of the Spike protein across the simulation is plotted in Fig. 10a -d, respectively. Asp30 showed better free energy contribution in binding to the ligand, Rutin Fig. 9 A: Free energy contribution in binding between ACE2 and Spike by the residues of the ACE2 (a) and the Spike (b) for the APO (black), Rutin (red), and Swertia (green) simulation systems DAB10 as compared to the Spike protein (Fig. 10a) . The free energy difference was around 1-2 kcal/mol. In case of His34, a significant difference of around 3 kcal/mol was observed when contributing in binding to the Spike protein and Rutin DAB10 (Fig. 10b) . The contribution being better for the ligand as compared to the Spike protein. Figure 10c shows the free energy contribution in binding made by the Arg393 of ACE2. The larger population obtained showed similar free energy values while contributing in binding to the Spike protein or Rutin DAB10. However, a small population was obtained in the Rutin system with a difference of around 1 kcal/mol. This may infer that the binding of Arg393 to Rutin DAB10 improved as compared to the Spike protein. Similar behavior was observed for the Tyr453 of the Spike protein (Fig. 10d) , where in the free energy contribution in binding to the Rutin DAB10 was better than to the ACE2. The free energy difference was observed to be around 2 kcal/mol. Figure S4 represents the average free energy contribution in binding obtained for the residues of ACE2 and the Spike protein in the Swertia system. Figure S4A represents the residues of ACE2 and their average free energy contribution in binding to Spike (black) and Swertiapuniside (green). The His34 and Arg393 of ACE2 were observed to contribute more in binding to Swertiapuniside as compared to the Spike protein. Tyr453 of the Spike protein too, showed more contribution in binding to Swertiapuniside as compared to the ACE2 ( Figure S4B ). The free energy contribution made by these three residues is shown in Fig. 11 . Figure 11a shows the free energy contribution for His34 of ACE2. The values were observed to be fluctuating as multiple peaks were obtained when bound to Swertiapuniside. However, significant conformations were sampled with better binding to Swertiapuniside with a maximum free energy difference of around 4 kcal/mol. In case of Arg393 of ACE2, the free energy difference was observed to be 1 kcal/mol (Fig. 11b) . This residue too was observed to have better binding to Swertiapuniside. Tyr453 of the Spike protein showed better contribution in binding to Swertiapuniside as compared to ACE2 (Fig. 11c) .",

Five of these hydrogen bonds were, namely Lys353-Asn501, Lys353-Gly496, Gly354-Gly502, Asp355-Thr500, and Arg357-Thr500 with 100% occupancy in all the three systems.

Table 6 shows the different parameters that describe the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and toxicity properties of the phytochemicals obtained as top hits from the crystal structure docking and the ensemble docking protocol. A total of eight phytochemicals belonging to six Indian medicinal plants were obtained. The gastrointestinal absorption (GI), water solubility (WS), and skin permeation (SP) were calculated to understand the absorption properties. All the phytochemicals show favorable values for each of these parameters. The blood-brain-barrier (BBB) crossing, subcellular localization, and P-glycoprotein substrate (P-gly sub) parameters were calculated to understand the distribution properties. Expect for the phytochemical, oleic acid, all others were predicted to have a subcellular localization in the mitochondria. Oleic acid was predicted to have a subcellular localization in the plasma membrane. Four of the phytochemicals were predicted unable to cross the BBB. Two of phytochemicals were predicted to serve as the P-glycoprotein substrate. Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG), cytochrome 1A2 (CYP1A2), cytochrome 2C19 (CYP2C19), cytochrome 2D6 (CYP2D6), and cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitory property were observed to understand the metabolism of the phytochemicals. Four of the phytochemicals were predicted to be hERG inhibitors. None of the eight phytochemicals were predicted as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors. The toxicity was studied by predicting the carcinogenic (CAR) property of the phytochemicals. None of the eight phytochemicals were observed to have carcinogenic property. The drug likeliness of the phytochemicals was predicted by calculating the molecular weight, partition co-efficient (AlogP), hydrogen bond acceptor moieties (HB-Acc), hydrogen bond donor moieties (HB-Don), and number of rotatable bonds (Table 7) . Oleic acid from the plant Azadirachta indica (Neem/Indian Lilac) was observed to have the lowest molecular weight. Swertiapuniside and Cardiofolioside B were observed to be the most hydrophilic based on the AlogP values. Oleic acid was observed to be the most lipophilic based on the AlogP values. Swertiapuniside from the plant Swertia chirayita was observed to have the maximum number of hydrogen bond acceptor and donor moieties. Octadecanoate from the plant Azadirachta indica (Neem/Indian Lilac) was observed to have the maximum number of the rotatable bonds.",

On similar lines, these properties for the phytochemicals predicted as inhibitors against ACE2-Spike protein which is also a crucial PPI for viral entry into the host cells were calculated. Novel approaches in delivering the drug as well as disease-specific conditions may help to overcome the physiochemical shortcomings of the phytochemicals (Fakhri et al. 2021) .

The conformational parameters used to calculate the stability of the ACE2-Spike complex revealed increased variation in certain regions of the ACE2 and the Spike protein in case of ligand-bound systems. The interaction analysis of the top-ranked drugs, Rutin DAB10, and Swertiapuniside with the ACE2-Spike complex revealed that the residues present on the interface of the two proteins formed weaker interactions with one another. Few hydrogen bonds which are known to present in the experimental structure of ACE2-Spike complex were observed to be maintained throughout the simulations when in the ligand-free state. However, the presence of these two ligands abrogates the formation of these hydrogen bonds, thereby destabilizing the ACE2-Spike complex. The stability of native hydrogen bonds was affected more when the ACE2-Spike was bound to Swertiapuniside as compared to Rutin DAB10. The free energy analysis also revealed that the residues involved in hydrogen bonding, namely His34 from ACE2 and Tyr453 from the Spike protein, were involved in forming interactions with the ligand molecules rather than one another. The ensemble docking also revealed FDA drugs, namely Escin and Capreomycin sulfate, which are known to possess anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity. Elbasvir, an antiviral drug, was also obtained as a top hit. In case of phytochemicals, Swertiapuniside was obtained as the top hit drug in direct as well as ensemble docking. Few other phytochemicals from the medicinal plants Neem and Ashwagandha were also observed to bind efficiently with the ACE2-Spike complex. These natural compounds were also observed to interact well with the residues present on the interface of the ACE2-Spike complexes. Owing to strong interactions with the drug targets, few of the FDAapproved and natural compounds of medicinal plant origin may prove to probable candidates for drug repurposing against the COVID-19 infection.",

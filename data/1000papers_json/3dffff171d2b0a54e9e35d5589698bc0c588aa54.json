A total of 175 patients (79.0\u00b17.0 years) undergoing outpatient or home-based rehabilitation, stratified into groups, based on frailty status. The percentage of patients who went out at least once a week decreased after the outbreak from 91% to 87%, from 65% to 46%, and from 47% to 36% in the non-frail, frail, and nursing care requirement groups, respectively. The proportion of older patients participating in exercise during the outbreak was 75%, 51%, and 41% in the non-frail, frail, and nursing care requirement groups, respectively. The proportion of older patients participating in voluntary exercise after instruction was lowest in the frail group (35%). Older patients with frailty are susceptible to the negative effects of refraining from physical activity and require careful management.",

In fact, it has been estimated that the average number of steps taken by 455,404 people in 187 countries decreased by 27.3% approximately a month after the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (1) . In Japan, the state of emergency was declared between April and May 2020, leading to restrictions on activities and time spent outdoors (2) . Moreover, a survey of 1,600 older adults revealed that the amount of physical activity they participated in decreased by approximately 30% after the outbreak, relative to the pre-outbreak levels. Frailty is a state that falls on a scale from robustness to disability, affecting functional outcomes and need for nursing care, and increasing the risk of premature mortality (3) (4) (5) . Decreased activity in older adults increases the risk of frailty; the risk of associated disability is further increased in people with underlying diseases (6) .",

Six types of programs are provided: balance improvement, strengthening, inactivity prevention, cogni-package, feeding and swallowing improvement, and nutrition improvement.

In fact, their baseline rate of exercise was higher than that of the other groups, suggesting that their exercise efforts may have been habitual.

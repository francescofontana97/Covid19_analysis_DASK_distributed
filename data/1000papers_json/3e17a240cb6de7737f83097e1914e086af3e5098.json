Our aim is to characterise the precise nature and extent of organ dysfunction 34 following an episode of AP. 35 Methods and Analysis 36 This is an observational prospective cohort study in a single centre comprising an acute 37 University hospital and clinical research facility. Participants will be adult patient admitted 38 with AP. Participants will undergo assessment at recruitment, 3 months and 3 years. At each 39 time point, multiple biochemical and/or physiological assessments to measure 40 cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, renal and cognitive function, diabetes mellitus, and quality 41 of life. Recruitment was from 30th November 2017 to 31 st May 2020; last follow-up 42 measurements is due 31 st May 2023. The primary outcome measure is the incidence of new-43 onset type 3c diabetes mellitus during follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include: 44 quality of life analyses (SF-36, GIQLI); Montreal cognitive assessment; organ system 45 physiological performance; multiomics predictors of AP severity, detection of premature 46 cellular senescence. In a nested cohort within the main cohort, individuals may also consent 47 to multiparameter MRI scan, echocardiography, pulmonary function testing, 48 cardiopulmonary exercise testing and pulse-wave analysis. 49 Ethics and dissemination: This study has received the following approvals: UK IRAS Number 50 178615; South-east Scotland Research Ethics Committee number 16/SS/0065. Results will be 51 made available to AP survivors, caregivers, funders and other researchers. Publications will 52 be open-access. 53 Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier (NCT03342716) and ISRCTN 50581876; Pre-54 results 55 56 Strengths and limitations 57 Strengths",

            "text": "pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas usually triggered by 71 gallstones or excess alcohol consumption. The incidence of AP ranges from 13 to 45 per 72 100,00 individuals, is increasing 1 , and varies between nations. For example, USA, Finland, 73 Scotland and Germany report higher incidences than England and The Netherlands 2-5 . AP 74 triggers a cascade of inflammatory events causing cell damage and release of damage-75 associated molecular patterns that trigger inflammation and cytokine release, initiating a 76 systemic inflammatory response resulting in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in 77 1 in 5 individuals. AP-MODS has a 21% fatality rate during the index episode, and overall in-78 hospital mortality is 5.2% in Scotland 6 7 . AP is graded into mild, moderate and severe, based 79 on local and systemic determinants of severity as per the most recent AP classifications 80 (Determinant-based Classification 8 and Revised Atlanta Classification 9 ). Organ failure in AP 81 most commonly affects the respiratory, renal and cardiovascular systems, but can involve any 82 system 10 . The pattern of organ failure is difficult to predict and a high level of inter-individual 83 variance is seen, regardless of the aetiology. The molecular mechanisms that explain this 84 inter-individual variation in local and systemic inflammatory processes in AP remain 85 unidentified 11 . Multiomics analysis of serial time course blood samples has defined molecular 86 patterns in human AP, called endotypes, but the precise relevance of these endotypes to 87 clinical and therapeutic decision-making is not yet determined 12 . 88 Recently published data from a retrospective analysis of patients with AP has shown that 89 the early development of MODS is associated with an increased mortality rate up to 10 years 90 after the index presentation 13 . This strongly suggests that MODS in acute pancreatitis (AP-91 MODS) has a persistent and deleterious impact on patients' physiological status, though the 92 exact nature of this pathology remains to be characterised. Existing studies indicate that most 93 deaths are the result of cardiovascular, pulmonary, digestive or malignant disease 14-17 . In 94 addition, the new onset of diabetes (Type 3c DM) or impaired glucose tolerance, peripheral 95 neuropathy and exocrine dysfunction have been documented as sources of morbidity in the 96 years following the index attack of SAP 17 18 . Patients with alcohol-induced pancreatitis may be 97 at particularly increased risk of progression to chronic pancreatitis 15 , however the 98 development of long term complications is likely to be influenced by multiple, and as-yet 99 unconfirmed, factors.",

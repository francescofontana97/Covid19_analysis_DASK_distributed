Since late February, major cities across China have gradually eased their restriction levels and partially resumed public transportation. 9 As the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan faces the dilemma of balancing the substantial accumulating economic losses with the hard-earned control of the epidemic.

In cases where the epidemic is able to be contained without a second outbreak, the dominant route of transmission would switch back to public transmission after lifting the quarantine (Figure S5A ). In cases where the epidemic results in a second major outbreak ( Figure S5B ), the second outbreak would be predominantly driven by household transmission. Our estimate that~70% of all infected cases were due to household transmission is also in broad agreement with a recent report from the World Health Organization (78%-85% 10 ). Further, we estimated 5% hospital-acquired infections in patients (1.1%) and medical staff (3.8%), which is consistent with a recent clinical report. 11 Our study suggests that maintaining a reduction in the contact rate below the pre-quarantine levels is an important ongoing intervention until a vaccine is available. If residents return to the same level of activities as pre-quarantine, a very high level of facial mask usage rate of 85% (or other powerful interventions) will be required. Any additional public interactions, such as the influx of the five million residents returning to Wuhan, may trigger a second outbreak. Governments will need to determine how to minimize public contacts from workplaces,venues for essential daily commodities, residents, leisure, entertainment venues, and public events although limiting or modifying the latter may be important. Intercity travel should be minimized, and the return of the residents may need to be staged.

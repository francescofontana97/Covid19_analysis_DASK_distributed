(Li et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2020; Roy, 2020) However, such observation for a long period is not common in Indian literature. One multicentric study discussed the changes between March to May 2020 from six cities in India and found a positive relationship between temperature and Covid 19. (Kumar, 2020) However, the relation during the rainy season is yet to be documented. Therefore, the present analysis tried to find out the impact of temperature on Covid 19, taking account of the rainy season.",

These three parameters were compared with daily new positive cases. The correlation coefficient was calculated. Taking a lag period of one week, a similar exercise was done again. Where data were missing, an average of two days was taken for plotting the graphs. Bengaluru witnessed a disproportionate rise from the last week of June.

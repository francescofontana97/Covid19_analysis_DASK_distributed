Knowing the trend of the COVID-19 pandemic is critical for the federal and local governments and health care system to prepare plans. Our aim was to develop an approach and create a SAS macro to estimate the growth rate and doubling time in days. We fit a series of growth curves using a rolling approach to estimate the growth rates and the doubling times. This approach was applied to the death data of New York State during March 14 th and 31 st . The growth rate was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.39-0.57) and the doubling time was 2.77 days (95% CI, 2.49-3.",

In the United States, the cumulative number of identified COVID-19 cases was 186,101 as of March 31st, 2020; among the identified cases, 3603 died [3] . To slow the spread of COVID-19, federal and local governments issued mitigation measures such as case isolation, quarantine, school closures and closing non-essential businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic imposes tremendous challenges to the US health care system, particularly given concerns that the need for hospital beds and ICU beds could exceed capacity [4] [5] [6] . Predicting the future numbers of COVID-19 cases and healthcare utilization is critical for governments and health care systems preparation plans [4, 6, 7] . Two useful and critical quantities for prediction are the growth rate [8] and the doubling time of number of events [9] . The growth rate is the percent change of daily events (e.g, COVID-19 cases, number of patients hospitalized or number of deaths). The doubling time is the length of time required to double the number of daily events.",

When COVID-19 testing is widely available to the public and the number of COVID-19 testing is less selective, these models can also be used to directly estimate the growth rate and the doubling time for COVID-19 cases. Due to a lag in reporting death, it is recommended to exclude the recent 1-2 days' death data in fitting the growth curves. This paper illustrates that death data can be used to estimate the growth rate and doubling time to aid predicting future deaths, hospitalizations and COVID-19 cases. Because a series of growth curves were fit, the RGCA approach can also be used for real-time monitoring of the epidemic trend as shown in Figure 1 .",

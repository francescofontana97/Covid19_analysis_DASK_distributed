Biological agents are usually invisible and possess the ability to infect in tiny doses [1, 2] . They also have the cunning ability to replicate rapidly and require minimal resources to survive. For these reasons, it is impossible to feel their presence initially or to predict the risks they present. Recently, it has been demonstrated that bioterrorism raises the specter of exposure to toxins by devising new deliveries by which BAs can be weaponized [5] [6] [7] . It has become apparent that BAs weapons pose a real and potentially immediate threat as they are relatively cheap to manufacture and employ, and they have a tremendous potential impact as terror weapons [2] . These properties make biological weapons attractive to terrorist organizations.",

The bioelement interacts with the analyte under investigation, and the biological response is converted into an electrical signal by the transducer (Fig. 2.1) [16, 17] .",

Nonetheless, these antibodies lack the stability needed to detect pathogenic species under harsh environments and necessitate a one-to-one pairing of antibody-based sensors for each analyte to be detected. Whereas nucleic acid probe-based techniques such as PCR can reach single-cell detection limits, they still need the extraction of nucleic acids and are limited in portability [21, 22] . It should be noticed that the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and their resulting intrinsic stabilities render them to be commonly selected for their use as molecular recognition elements in electronic biosensing platforms [23] [24] [25] . AMPs do exist in nature and are located either in the skin of higher organisms and/or in the extracellular milieu of bacteria [25] . The replacements of current antibody-based affinity probes, with more stable and durable AMPs in biological sensors, have a major advantage as recognition elements.

On the other hand, the membranes of plants and animals separate negative charges to the inner leaflet and contain cholesterols that decrease the activity of the AMP [25] . The AMPs, linear cationic peptides such as magainins, are in particular, attractive for the microbial sensing applications due to their small molecular size and intrinsic stability [26, 27] Especially, the positively charged AMP magainin I (GIGKFLHSAGKFGKAFVGEIMKS) binds most selectively to the bacterial cell E. coli O157\u2236H7 as a precursor to bactericidal activity [25] [26] [27] .",

            "text": "The first step toward the development of an AMP-based, label-free electronic biosensor is to target the microbial cells by using magainin I through the use of the impedance spectroscopy. It should be noted that electrical impedance measures the total opposition to a circuit or a part of the circuit presented to an electric current. Usually, the impedance is the results for both resistance and reactance. It is important to remember that the resistance component is formed from collisions of the currentcarrying charged particles with the internal structure of the conductor. Furthermore, the reactance component is an additional opposition to the movement of the electric charge that results from the changing magnetic and electric fields in circuits carrying alternating current. Figure 2 .2 outlines the sensing platform. First, the AMPs are immobilized on the micro-fabricated interdigitated gold electrodes ( Fig. 2.2a) . It should be specified that magainin I contains a cysteine residue on the C terminus ( Fig. 2.2b) , which allows its covalent attachment to the gold electrodes. Next, the heat-killed bacterial cells are injected and incubated on the AMP-modified electrodes [25] . When the bacteria are recognized by the AMPs, the binding will ensue (Fig. 2.2c) , causing the dielectric property to changes that can be monitored by a spectrum analyzer. Usually, the impedance is measured over a frequency range of 10 Hz to 100 kHz. Figure 2 .2d shows an optical micrograph of the device, which is made using standard microfabrication techniques.",

When a blank device with no immobilized AMPs was also tested for comparison, it was found that there was no change in the impedance of the blank device without immobilized AMPs, upon exposure to various bacterial concentrations. Figure 2 .3a demonstrates that at low frequencies, the various concentrations of bacterial cells have the effect of increasing the impedance, which is proportional to to the number of cells present in the sample. As the frequency increases, the input to the impedance from the bacterial cells decreases. This leaves only the dielectric relaxation of small dipoles, including water molecules in the buffer solution, to affect the measured impedance. Figure 2 .3b represents the impedance change at a fixed frequency of 10 Hz. The change in the impedance is directly proportional to the number of bacterial cells attached to the immobilized AMPs and displayed in a logarithmic increase with respect to a series of diluted bacterial concentrations. Remarkably, the detection limit of the response of the hybrid AMP-microelectrode device to E. coli was established to be 10 3 cfu\u2215mL (1 bacterium\u2215\u03bcL). This lowest limit of detection seems to be limited by the presence of impedance due to the electrical double layer formed from the electrode polarization effect at low frequencies. Notably, these sensitivity limits are clinically relevant and compare favorably to AMP-based fluorescent assays [26] , antibody-based impedance sensors [27] , and to the LAL test [25] .",

The selectivity was first studied by using methods of fluorescent microscopy. This was done by staining bacterial cells and optically mapping their binding density to gold films hybridized with AMPs. The discriminative binding patterns of immobilized magainin I and the surface density of the different bacterial cells (all 10 7 cfu/mL) stained with propidium iodide (PI) nucleic acid stain are showed in Fig. 2 .5. In summary, the coupling of AMPs with micro capacitive biosensors leads to the implementation of a portable, label-free sensing platform for the sensing of infectious agents. The obtainable sensitivity approached 1 bacterium\u2215\u03bcL-a clinically acceptable limit-and the AMPs allowed for sufficient selectivity to differentiate pathogenic and Gram-negative bacteria while retaining broadband detection capabilities [25] [26] [27] [28] .

This Array Biosensor has been used for the quantitative immunoassays versus a broad number of toxins, and for its usefulness as semi-selective molecules which can be used as alternative recognition moieties [29] [30] [31] . In this sensor, the antibodies or other capture molecules are immobilized in a 2-D arrangement on an optical waveguide, and then a standard fluoroimmunoassays are donewithin the channels of a multi-channel flow cell, which is placed on the waveguide surface ( Fig. 2.6 , left). In the NRL array biosensor, the spots are interrogated using evanescent wave technology that is specifically: a light issued from a 635 nm diode laser that is focused into the edge of the patterned waveguide and after propagation and mixing within the waveguide, the confined beam generates an evanescent field in the sensing portion of the waveguide [29, 32] . The definition of an evanescent field or wave is a vibrating electric and/or magnetic field, which does not spread as an electromagnetic wave but whose energy is spatially concentrated in the proximity of the source (oscillating charges and currents) [32] . The surface attached molecules marked with fluorophore are excited by this evanescent field, generating a fluorescence signal, which is then detected using a CCD camera fitted with appropriate bandpass and longpass filters ( Fig. 2.6, right) . Because of the limitation of the penetration depth of the evanescent field, only surface-attached fluorophores are excited, allowing the analysis of heterogenous or turbid samples. The position and intensities of the fluorescent spots express the identity and concentration of the target sample in each lane [29, 32] .",

These unique advantages have allowed them to serve as multicolor or multiplexed immunoassays. It should be mentioned that in terms of coupling QDs to antibodies, the most common method reported in the literature utilizes biotin-avidin interactions [48] . The avidin/streptavidin-coated QDs are commercially available, while biotin-labeling of antibodies are usually prepared in-house. The QDs containing free carboxylic acid groups from their capping agents may also be covalently attached to the epsilon amine of an antibody's lysine residues by using EDC/NHS coupling chemistry [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . Instead, simple electrostatic interactions can be used depending on the overall protein charge at the pH of conjugation [48] . For example, sandwich immunoassays were used by Goldman et al. for the simultaneous recognition of four toxins in a single microtiter well, as shown in Fig. 2 .9 [47, 48, 53] . In this assay, antibodies immobilized in a microtiter well plate were first subjected to the mixed toxin sample. Antibodies particular for each of the toxins linked to a different color QD were then put in the microtiter well plate. The subsequent signal from the mixed toxin samples was then deconvoluted using a simple algorithm. Similarly, QD-antibody bioconjugates were used to detect and distinguish between diphtheria toxin and tetanus toxin proteins, which were generally immobilized onto poly-L-lysine coated coverslips and for the simultaneous detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella typhimurium bacteria using various colored QDs as immunoassay labels [54] .",

Initially, miRNAs were oxidized with sodium periodate to oxidize the ribose 2\u2032-and 3\u2032-hydroxyl groups into aldehydes. The resulting dialdehyde was then reacted with biotin-X-hydrazide resulting in biotinylated miRNA. This was followed by immobilizing the 5\u2032 amine-modified oligonucleotide probes antisense to miRNAs on the amine-reactive glass slides. The biotinylated miRNAs were captured on the microarray by oligonucleotide probes in hybridization. QDs were labeled on the captured miRNAs through the strong specific interaction of streptavidin and biotin. Since the QDs have a high extinction coefficient and quantum yield, so tiny amounts of miRNAs can be detected easily with a laser confocal scanner. In addition, as an alternative, the colorimetric gold-silver detection method was used in which captured miRNAs were labeled with streptavidin-conjugated gold followed by silver enhancement. During silver enhancement, the gold nanoparticles bound to miRNAs catalyzed the reduction of silver ions to metallic silver, which further autocatalyzed the reduction of silver ions to form metallic silver precipitation on gold, resulting in a signal enhancement [52] . This process allowed straightforward detection of the microarray with an ordinary charge-coupled device (CCD) camera mounted on a microscope.",

This was significantly better than other dye-based methods and further hindered the use of amplification while allowing a semi-quantitative comparison of the amount of miRNA in different samples [53] . Figure 2 .11 displays a set of images for various concentrations of miRNA (21 nt siRNA) detected by QD [53] . It should be noted that the signals become gradually weaker with the decrease in miRNA concentration (Fig. 2.11a ). When the miRNA concentration was as low as 39 pM, the fluorescence signal could be detected, indicating that the lower detection limit of miRNA microarrays is at least 0.4 fmol. As shown in Fig. 2 .11b, the fluorescence intensity of the spots is linear to the model miRNA in a logarithmic fashion from 156 to 20,000 pM, and the dynamic range is about two orders of magnitude. This implies that this method can be used to quantify miRNAs with a broad concentration range [53] .",

FRET has been extensively used in biophysical and biochemical studies to probe ligandreceptor binding and molecular structural changes [55] [56] [57] . In the following example, the authors incubated the dye-labeled DNA targets with biotinylated capture DNA probes, which were allowed to be conjugated to streptavidin QDs, only when the two DNA sequences hybridize. The resulting hybridization was then detected via FRET between the QD and the dye acceptor ( Fig. 2.12 ) [53] . It should be noted that the additional background caused by the direct acceptor excitation is virtually eliminated through the choice of an appropriate excitation wavelength; this led to a 100-fold improvement in sensitivity compared to single organic dye molecular beacon-based detection. This type of sensing schemes can also be amenable to use in a multiplex format. The narrow and symmetric QD emissions allow easy spectral deconvolution, and the most straightforward configuration relies on several QD populations interacting with the same dye acceptor rather than the opposite [53].",

Binding of the pathogen to the cell surface antibodies causes an increase in intracellular Ca levels, resulting in the emission of light from the cytosolic aequorin [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . Two regular genetic modifications enable engineered B-cell lines to express cytosolic aequorin, as well as membrane-bound antibodies specific for pathogens of interest [62, 63] . This was achieved by crosslinking the membrane-bound antibodies to a polyvalent antigen that induces a signal-transduction cascade. This latter, sequentially involves tyrosine kinases, phospholipase C, and inositol triphosphate (IP3). The IP3 activates calcium channels, thereby increasing cytosolic calcium from both internal stores and the extracellular medium, which stimulates the aequorin, causing it to emit light (Fig. 2.13) [58, 59, [62] [63] [64] .",

The novel genetic-engineering system developed by Petrovick et al. have consisted of the efficient production of B-cell lines that can react specifically and rapidly to a variety of pathogens [58] . The antibody genes were cloned from hybridomas and inserted into expression vectors. These were transfected into a parental B cell line that expresses active aequorin, and the cells are screened for their response to the pathogen. The genetically modified CANARY cells can be applied separately in a particular identification assay, or as many as three can be linked to accomplish a multiplexed assay. Instead, several antibodies can be expressed in a single cell line to provide a classification assay [59] . It is also possible to establish B cells that emit at various wavelengths of light, allowing multiplexed assays that simultaneously discriminate among several targets [58] . ",

The capability to identify nucleic acid (NA: DNA or RNA) sequences is central in the deduction of the first hard NA sequence information, concerning a new or genetically modified pathogen [58] . It is crucial to develop assays that have the flexibility to respond quickly to new threats. For this reason, developing NA probes allow for the rapid and quick examination of the actual genetics of the target organism [58] . When the NA sequence of a pathogen is revealed, multiple short probes are created that bind adjacent to each other along a specific sequence on the target NA [59] . Consequently, Petrovick et al. developed a novel assay that uses a single CANARY cell line that expresses an antibody against digoxigenin. Each of these probes is marked with a single digoxigenin molecule. If these probes are added to the solution containing the target NA sequence, the binding of multiple digoxigenin-containing probes produces a tight cluster of immobilized digoxigenin molecules, which will stimulate light production from the CANARY cell (see Fig. 2 .15) [58] .",

Because each microsphere is optically wired to fiber, the specific interactions on each microsphere surface can be independently monitored.

The fluorescent tag is commonly incorporated into the target molecules via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [73] . This primer labeling method is convenient when amplification is needed for detection, or when it is used to construct a cDNA library from a genomic RNA pool via reverse transcription. In addition, the derivatized fiber core experiments can detect unlabeled (non-fluorescent) target solutions [66] . This is achieved by competitive hybridization with fluorescent target samples. In this method, the fluorescent synthetic target complements are synthesized and initially hybridized to the array to saturate the array probe elements [66] . The unlabeled target solution is then hybridized to the same array, competing with the prehybridized synthetic targets. The presence of the unlabeled target is determined by a fluorescence decrease caused by the displacement of the fluorescent synthetic target by the unlabeled species. This procedure eliminates the need to incorporate fluorescence into the target and allows quantitative measurements to be performed. These fiber optic platforms are the basis for microsphere array designs that improved array fabrication and allowed extremely high-density sensor placement [66] .",

When a portion of the light energy excites the electrons of the metal surface layer, at a certain angle of incidence, it creates electron movements which propagate parallel to the metal surface. This electric oscillation is termed as a \"plasmon.\" This oscillation, in turn, makes an electric field whose range is approximately 300 nm from the border between the metal surface and sample solution [76, 79] . In a commercial SPR biosensor configuration, the incident light employed is generated by a high-reflective index glass prism of the Kretschmann geometry of the attenuated total reflection (ATR) method (Fig. 2.20 ) [74] .",

In addition, it should be noted that when the surface of the sensing material has been coated through biomolecule attachment only, there will be perhaps an unnoticed small change in the reflective index of the sensing medium, and as a result, the plasmon oscillation cannot be formed ( Fig. 2. 20c, left side) [74] . However, when the metal surface has been coated with an analyte-biorecognition couple of biomolecules, detection is achieved by measuring the changes in the reflected light obtained on a detector ( Fig. 2 .20c, right side). In addition, the amount of surface concentration can be quantified by monitoring the reflected light intensity or tracking the resonance angle shifts.

In SPR imaging, the incidence angle remains constant, and the attachment of biomolecules on a gold surface is measured as the change in reflectivity (or reflectance) in relation to the incident ray intensity, unlike SPR sensors that depend on the measurement of the absorption dip in the SPR angle or SPR wavelength [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] . Recently, it was shown that SPR imaging technology using a multi-analyte biosensor allows the measurement of a high-throughput methodology, and it achieves a similar degree of sensitivity of conventional SPR biosensors (Fig. 2.21 ) [82] .

It should be noted that although fluorescence detection is the most popular, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based immunoassay formats with surface imaging capabilities are growing in popularity [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] . Multiplexing, or simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, is one of the most important prerequisites for biothreat agent detection. As mentioned in our introduction, the presented work is more a \"Comptes Rendus\" and an introduction to this series of sensing measuring devices used for the detection of biological warfare agents that were presented to the participants of this NATO-ASI meeting.

For example,Fig. 2.4c demonstrates the microelectrode array after exposure to 107 cfu\u2215mL bacterial cells. Simultaneously, the impedance response was continuously monitored during the sample flow-through process(Fig. 2.4d).All samples generated a measurable response with respect to the control sample within 5 min, with the highest concentration sample producing a response within 30 s; the responses saturated after 20 min. These results augured well for the implementation of this sensor in continuous monitoring of flowing water supplies.",

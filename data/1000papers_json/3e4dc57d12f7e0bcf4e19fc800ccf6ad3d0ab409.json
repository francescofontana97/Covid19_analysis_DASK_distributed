Xu, et al., Differential host circRNA expression profiles in human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, Infection, Genetics and Evolution (2021), https://doi.Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging and highly pathogenic coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and might even lead to death. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a new type of RNAs, are implicated in viral pathogenesis and host immune responses. However, their dynamic expression patterns and functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be unclear. We herein performed genome-wide dynamic analysis of circRNAs in human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at four time points. A total of 6,118 circRNAs were identified at different genomic locations, including 5,641 known and 477 novel circRNAs. Notably, a total of 42 circRNAs were significantly 1 These authors contributed equally to this work. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof dysregulated, wherein 17 were up-regulated and 25 were down-regulated following infection at multiple phases. The gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that the parental genes of circRNAs were mainly involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Further, the RNA binding protein (RBP) prediction analysis indicated that the dysregulated circRNAs could regulate mRNA stability, immunity, cell death by binding specific proteins. Additionally, the circRNA-miRNA-gene network analysis showed that circRNAs indirectly regulated gene expression by absorbing their targeted miRNAs. Collectively, these results shed light on the roles of circRNAs in virus-host interactions, facilitating future studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.",

Previous studies have highlighted the characteristics of viral infection, which lacked robust induction of type I and type III interferons, and instead released numerous chemokines and excessive cytokines. Additionally, in vivo analysis of antiviral host transcriptional response showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response by activating antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3 and T helper type 1 (Th1) chemokines CXCL9/10/11, along with a reduction in the transcription of ribosomal proteins using CIRI (v2.0.3) (Gao et al., 2015) based on junction reads and GT-AG splicing signals. The reads mapped to each gene were counted by htseq-count (Anders et al., 2015) , and the obtained circRNA candidates were compared with that of the circAtlas (Ji et al., 2019) (http://159.226.67.237:8080/new/index.php) and circBase databases (Gla\u017ear et al., 2014) (http://circrna.org/cgi-bin/singlerecord.cgi?id=mmu_circ_0001771) to determine the known and novel circRNAs.

The results with regard to position distribution of circRNAs on genome showed that the circRNAs were classified into 5 categories, including sense-overlapping circRNAs (90.36%), exonic circRNAs (3.38%), intergenic circRNAs (3.45%), antisense circRNAs (2.04%) and intronic circRNAs (0.77%). The vast majority of circRNAs were sense-overlapping, while a small portion was either J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f intergenic or intronic (Fig. 1C) , and this is consistent with the results reported in the previous studies (Deng et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020b) . Generally, the transcription of host circRNAs in human cells remains diverse. By analyzing the genomic position of the parent genes of circRNAs, the host circRNAs were shown to be widely transcribed throughout the whole genome across all chromosomes, except the Y chromosome (Fig. 1D ). The distribution number of circRNAs on chromosome 2 was the most frequently transcribed, reaching 589, while that on chromosome 21 was the least, only 58.

The transcriptomic data from primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection activates antiviral interferon (IFN) innate response. Several interferon stimulating genes, acute inflammatory response and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were significantly activated during virus infection (Fagone et al., 2020 ). An integrative proteo-transcriptomic analysis J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that identified ErbB, HIF-1, mTOR and TNF signaling pathways showed marked modulation during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Appelberg et al., 2020) . Consistent with these results, a large number of parental genes of differential circRNAs enriched in those pathways were associated with antiviral interferon (IFN) response, chemokine signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway. These results suggested that the genes related to early inflammatory response, immune response, and cell signal transduction act as parental genes of circRNAs and play biological functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is worth noting that the differential expression of circRNAs was gradually increased with progression of infection. However, the expression of circRNAs was decreased sharply at 12hpi, and then rebounded to the highest number at 24hpi later. Not only that, the common differential expression of circRNAs at four time points was not observed, which might be due to the dynamic regulation of expression and function of circRNAs. These results suggested complex molecular behavior of the host cells in response to viral infection.",

Many RBPs are related to RNA stability. Other RBPs, such as AGO2, EIF4A3 and IGF2BP3 are related to translation (Nielsen et al., 1999) , and FMRP is related to cellular response to virus (Zhou et al., 2014) . Specifically, the PUM2 protein can sponge to 3 circRNAs, which is positively regulated to RIG-I signaling pathway (Narita et al., 2014) . In this study, TDP43, which is a kind of RBP, was also predicted to regulate the apoptotic process of the host cell (Ayala et al., 2008) . RBPs prediction is consistent with the results of GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. These analyses provide new evidence to further study the functioning of differential circRNAs.

            "text": "of SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 cells, we screened out 42 significantly dysregulated circRNAs during SARS-CoV-2 infection. To validate the high consistency or universality of these expression changes of circRNAs in human lung epithelial cells, another human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were used to verify the expression changes of circRNAs during SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 8 significantly dysregulated circRNAs, including hsa_circ_0000566, hsa_circ_0060927, hsa_circ_0067985, circRNA_04769, hsa_circ_0001681, hsa_circ_0080941, hsa_circ_0080942, hsa_circ_0005630, were selected to verify the change in expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, the expression patterns of 7 circRNAs are similar to those of RNA-seq, supporting the reliability of the quantitative expression of circRNAs of RNA-seq. These results suggested the high consistency or universality of these expression changes of circRNAs in human lung epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. 3.4 Function associated analysis of circRNA parental genes , the GO and KEGG function enrichment analysis was conducted for parental genes of the dysregulated circRNAs. Overall, the parental genes are mainly enriched in biological process and cellular component, while the molecular function is rarely enriched at four time points. The enrichment analysis at 0 hpi suggested that the parental genes of differentially expressed circRNAs were implicated with biological processes, including signal transduction (GO:0023014), defense response to virus (GO:0051607), regulation of apoptotic process (GO:0042981), and innate immune response (GO:0045087), mRNA binding (GO:0003729), mRNA processing (GO:0006397), endocytosis (GO:0006897) etc. (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table 5). The parental genes of differentially expressed circRNAs at 7 hpi showed association with type I interferon signaling pathway (GO:0060337), antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I (GO:0002480), regulation of immune response (GO:0050776), interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0060333), etc. (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table 5). The parental genes of differentially expressed circRNAs at 12 hpi showed association with interleukin-7-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0038111), humoral immune response (GO:0006959), adaptive immune response (GO:0002250), immune response (GO:0006955), inflammatory response (GO:0006954), etc. (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Table 5). The parental genes of differentially expressed circRNAs at 24 hpi showed association with detection of virus (GO:0009597), regulation of type III interferon production (GO:0034344), positive regulation of interferon-beta secretion (GO:0035549), cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway in response to virus (GO:0039528), antigen processing and presentation of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I, etc. (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Table 5). Some common biological processes, such as regulation of immune response and defense response to virus, were enriched at four time points during viral infection. Next, the pathways that were significantly enriched by parental genes of differential circRNAs in lung epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2infection were further analyzed. At 0 hpi, only a few pathways showed significant enrichment, including mRNA surveillance pathway (hsa03015), Rap1 signaling pathway (hsa04015) and Ras signaling pathway (hsa04014) (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table 6). During the early stage of virus infection (7 hpi), a large number of pathways showed significant enrichment in antigen processing and presentation (hsa04612), Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis (hsa04666), chemokine signaling pathway (hsa04062), and MAPK signaling pathway (hsa04010) (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Table6). At 12 hpi, a few signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (hsa04060), ubiquitin mediated proteolysis (hsa04120) and endocytosis (hsa04144) (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Table 6). Finally, in the late stage of virus infection (24 hpi), a few signaling pathways were significantly enriched in RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway (hsa04622), antigen processing and presentation (hsa04612), natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity (hsa04650), and mRNA surveillance pathway (hsa03015) (Fig. 5D and SupplementaryTable 6). Notably, these GO and KEGG enrichment analyses results were similar to those reported by other studies(Li et al., 2020;Lou et al., 2019). Overall, these findings indicated that the parental genes of these differentially expressed circRNAs are involved in the regulation of viral infection and host antiviral response. analysis of circRNA regulating virus-host interaction by acting as miRNA and protein sponges As a competitive miRNA or protein sponge, circRNAs play an important role in regulating gene expression and function(Hansen et al., 2013;Li et al., 2015). To further explore the potential functions of circRNAs during SARS-CoV-2 infection, an integrated analysis of circRNA-miRNA-gene network was carried out. The top six significantly dysregulated circRNAs and top 40 significantly dysregulated genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection were used to construct ceRNA regulatory network. The results showed that the top 3 up-regulated circRNAs showed indirect up-regulation of the expression of the protein coding genes by binding their targeted miRNAs(Fig. 6A). Similarly, the top 3 down-regulated circRNAs showed indirect down-regulation of the expression of the protein coding genes by binding their targeted miRNAs (Fig. 6Band Supplementary",

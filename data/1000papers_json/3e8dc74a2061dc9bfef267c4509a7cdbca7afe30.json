            "text": "International challenges require a flexible mindset, effective knowledge, heightened creativity, improved \"teamwork\" cooperation, emotional competence, and mindful communication. The context and the environment where politicians and diplomats act are often very stressful. Especially in time of crisis (like the COVID-19), the tyranny of time causes undue pressure on cognitive and emotional processes, influencing adaptive decision-making. Scientists and policymakers must negotiate a common, not too impervious, path between them, where they can walk together. They need to develop together more effective tools that can really help to communicate an advice that goes in one ear and stays there. A smooth negotiating process of evidenceinformed policies can produce a psychological commitment to mutually satisfactory results. Over time, interactions built upon trust, understanding, respect, and mutual esteem tend to maximise long-term mutual benefit making new interactions smoother and more effective (Fisher et al. 1991) . The human links that are fostered, for better or worse, profoundly impact interpersonal negotiations and future interactions (Aquilar and Galluccio 2008; Pruitt 2002). Believing that relationships improve without a \"mindful\" individual effort is a mere \"desire\". Believing that relationships can deteriorate exclusively because of the \"other side\" is a demonstration of emotional incompetence (Galluccio 2005). Politicians and diplomats need to know when to wait and when to act decisively for the situation to evolve. Scientists, who have significant experience in research and specific fields, must also rely more on their intuitive gear, helping them to make sense of the situation (because the \"team crisis\" may ignore weak signals that individuals notice). In complex environments and unfamiliar situations, what diplomats/politicians really need is not to wait too long to get the right information, but to get the accurate way to read and understand the information in their possession (Klein 2009) and act as quickly as possible to define the problem in the possible way to facilitate adaptive decision-making.",

            "text": "In January 2020, world leaders and diplomats were taken by surprise, as were scientists, by the discovery of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the consequential COVID-19 crisis. They experienced an unknown situation where explicit knowledge did not work very well at first and where procedure lists did not necessarily improve performance in such a complex scenario. Scientists knew little about this new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and as they started to study and research it the disease was spreading rapidly. They collected data and began to work on it relentlessly. Anyway, the politicians had to make decisions as soon as possible. Unfortunately, when situations are complex, ambiguous, and uncertain, there is a tendency to use heuristic shortcuts to simplify problems and to exercise control through limited consultations and conflict avoidance between different parties (Aquilar and Galluccio 2008; Kahneman et al. 1982) . However, the models and recommendations should not oversimplify complex problems. This can be a great challenge in time of crisis, given the pressure to establish \"easily understandable\" solutions. As summarised by Albert Einstein: \"Everything should be as simple as possible but not simpler\". The politicians seemed to have minimised the problem perhaps because they wanted to avoid making drastic decisions. This initial minimisation delayed the deployment of early preventive policy actions, such as sustainable strategic plans to tackle the crisis; adequate allocation of physical and financial resources; international cooperation with other governments; and coordination of knowledge and plans. The more scientists were collecting data, the more you could see that this virus was particularly contagious and lethal. At that point, drastic and unpopular measures began to be taken. Countries and local authorities applied unprecedented blocking measures (lockdown), recommended \"stay-home\" protocols for citizens other than key workers, and banned public and private meetings for many weeks. Social distancing became a common phenomenon throughout the world. Travel outside local areas was reduced or interrupted almost everywhere, as was the production and purchase of many non-essential products. Education, work, and recreational facilities were shut down, and the global economy struggled to cope with this sudden transformation in production, delivery, and sales through supply chains in all sectors. This was the case with the COVID-19 crisis. The spread of contagion has been a history of misperception, misunderstanding, miscommunication, overconfidence, and lack of preparation. After a first phase of apparent concealment of the problem (the problem was simply not accepted and therefore it could not be given the right attention), in the second phase, the political actors were \"overtaken\" by the crisis. An alarmed anxiety made them focus mainly on the threats that this new coronavirus represented together with the fear that the problem was unsolvable. Then, in the third phase, the actors began to doubt their own ability to deal successfully with the problem, extremely frustrated in the face of the problem and tormented by their emotions and negative thoughts. They were emotionally overwhelmed. The perception of uncertainty associated with the dark side of the pandemic (unknown trajectory and knowledge) influenced the adaptive decision-making. Health was at stake, and social, economic, and environmental concerns were staggering. The whole situation broadened the perception of space and time around policymakers (as around people in general), increasing the late response. The latency of responses to the crisis could also be due to politicians' fear of losing power due to unpopular decisions taken in times of crisis. Empirical evidence confirms that politicians who are not facing imminent elections are eager to try different decision-making paths ",

These needs not only are material (food safety, physical safety, and physical well-being), but also include psychological needs such as identity, security, resilience, and a sense of justice (Burton 1990). The balance of these needs poses a major challenge to the resilience of policymaking processes.",

Decisions are influenced by a wide variety of factors (including politicians' values, their experience, and political judgment). This means that even in individual policy areas the evidence-informed policymaking must be sufficiently broad to develop a wide range of policy options and sufficiently detailed to be able to withstand intensive scrutiny. It is understood that in the case of a new crisis the mere application of procedures/norms will not be sufficient. This is precisely the definition of a crisis, as it has found us unprepared, and could suddenly send the decision-making machine into chaos. \"Policy makers are faced with irreducible complexity and radical uncertainty-and they must often rely on inadequate information. Policy makers think practically, are prepared to do anything that looks as if it might succeed and are reluctant to take big bets if not forced to do so\" (Gallucci 2012). In addition, policymakers face real problems. They would benefit from a multiple and integrated view of the same issue in order to capture all the consequences and likely interdependencies of a course of action. Policymakers need management tools, and they need help to link cause and effect (Gallucci 2012; George 1993; Maliniak et al. 2020).",

Instead, human beings have limited capacities to perceive, process, and organise information. Policymakers and advisers may adopt a series of cognitive shortcuts through heuristics that can be helpful in a variety of situations. Heuristics can help to achieve a certain degree of simplicity but can also be a source of significant errors and cognitive bias (Kahneman et al. 1982 ). In this model of cognitive shortcuts, people on the stage and behind the scenes may act within a simplified mental representation of the reality. Politicians (and scientists), like the rest of us, may be affected by various cognitive biases. We could be \"directed\" by cognitive dissonance, normality bias, or a syndrome of personal invulnerability. The theory of cognitive dissonance 1 is especially relevant to this topic. 1 In 1957, Leon Festinger advanced his classic theory of cognitive dissonance, which describes how people manage conflicting cognitions about themselves, their behaviour, or their environment. Festinger posited that when a person experiences a sense of inconsistency or contradiction represented by the conflict among such cognitions (which he termed dissonance) it will make that person uncomfortable enough to actually modify one of the conflicting beliefs to bring it into line with the other belief. Thus, the main issue addressed in cognitive dissonance research has been that of how people deal with thoughts or information implying that they have made a wrong decision. According to Cooper and Fazio (1984) , dissonance should be thought of more as an emotional reaction to the knowledge that one has been responsible for an action that has produced unwanted consequences. Cognitions that reduce this sense of responsibility (e.g. that one acted We can then often observe \"gaming the system\" motivational strategy, i.e. the manipulation of information through which the governmental decision-making process may be prone to a \"guided selection\" and the framing of information by \"proactive members of the staff\", altering the different opinions of advisors as well, in order to deliberately distort the information that will be taken into account by the final decision maker (Gellman 2008; Sunstein 2007) . This behaviour could be strictly linked to the phenomenon observed and described by Janis (1982) as \"groupthink\", in which few members of the team of decision makers could act as mindguards in a way to co-opt the process of decision-making, so as to exclude experts, mass media, and outside critics in order to retain unity and esprit de corps (Aquilar and Galluccio 2008). Both in \"gaming the system\" and \"groupthink\", the danger is that the final decision could be flawed. Incomplete investigation and acquisition of information jeopardise the adaptive decision-making and alternative courses of action.",

There was an expert, a European scientist, who showed a certain seriousness mixed with contempt in his non-verbal cues, looking angry at a politician, who was explaining certain political issues. Some politicians from different member states and the European institutions were annoyed by his non-verbal communication because they perceived this attitude as disrespectful and arrogant and started to act with hostility towards him (I spoke to all of them separately and they shared their perceptions with me). On the other side, I knew and perceived this scientist from a different perspective because I had met him at a dinner a few weeks before this negotiation round. On that occasion from our conversation, I had the feeling that he was overwhelmed by all these political issues for the simple reason that he was a scientist with a strong background on the environment policy and urban cities, but not on regional policy in general and especially not on policymaking processes (in this case also linked to agriculture). He seemed angry and almost disgusted because he was afraid of the difficulties of the matter and above all he did not know if he would be able to master it well and communicate to the audience the evidenceinformed policies regarding the negative potential of the proposed amendment to a EU's law they were negotiating about (i.e. in truth I must admit that this scientist always seemed serious and slightly disgusted when he listened carefully to someone: it was his way of paying attention to someone). In such cases, I think the best way to help the counterparts in expressing their emotions is to \"advise\" them at first to be aware of such dynamics and then to work on decoding problems as well. For example, we could introduce this dialogue: \"I feel that you are critical of this discussion and feel uncomfortable. Am I right? Or am I wrong? Perhaps you would like to give us your explanation and your interpretation of the topic and of our perception of your non-verbal communication, which seems rather hostile to me. Am I wrong?",

Metacognitive functions are mental activities aimed at solving cognitive tasks, mastering mental states, predicting, and explaining intrapersonal and interpersonal behaviours. The ability of people to monitor the contents of their conscious experience in order to recognise them as mental states (emotions, feelings, bodily sensations, thoughts, memories, ideas, opinions, expectations, fantasies) seems to be the implementation of the theory of mind that begins to develop in childhood ( 1. Resilience: how you face the crisis and how you recover slowly or quickly from adversity. 2. Outlook: how long you are able to sustain positive emotion and be focused on current issues. 3. Social intuition: how skilfully you are to grasp and integrate the social signals of people around you into your reasoning while interacting. 4. Self-awareness: how well you reflect on your integrated knowledge and how well you perceive the related bodily feelings reflecting emotions. 5.

This is something that other personality trait and temperament classification schemes do not have (Davidson and Begley 2013; Panksepp 2003). Each of the six dimensions has a specific identifiable neural signature, a good indication that they are real and not just a theoretical construct, as they describe an integrated continuum (Davidson 2003) . Although emotional style is ordinarily stable over time, it can be altered by conscious, intentional effort at any point in life on each or few of the six dimensions, through the intentional cultivation of specific mental qualities or habits (Begley 2007; Lowenstein and Parent 1999) . Research has shown that people can develop and acquire new specific skills through training tailored on the interpersonal skills they need and would like to learn (Davidson and Begley 2013). Therefore, we are working on effective ways to increase specific interpersonal skills developing tailor-made training programmes. This means improving interpersonal negotiating skills, through the strengthening of important cognitive and emotional processes to help main actors to better cooperate (i.e. self-awareness, attention, memory, empathy, outlook, to name but a few). This is done through the fostering of the metacognition functions (the ability to think about our memory and our judgments), regulation of emotions, and problem-solving modalities in the face of stress. We are willing to generate a longer term research and training agenda on the importance of psychological processes in interpersonal policymaking negotiations.",

Learning from experience is the most powerful way to lead. It produces the tacit knowledge that is crucial in a crisis (Nye 2008). Experience is not a simple accumulation of knowledge, but it is how we use our knowledge to adjust our attention. Joint attentional skills and attunement are features of prepared minds willing to cooperate. Their efforts and their interests have prepared them to notice things others miss (Klein 2013). But as explained before we also need to investigate core beliefs, because rigid beliefs anchor our understanding. Even if we have a lot of experience, if we are \"trapped\" in fixed mindsets we will miss the insights sitting right in front of us (Klein 2013). Of course, experience and intuition can be supplemented by analytic skills. The joint focus of scientists and policymakers on working on cognitive biases and emotional regulation in cooperative brainstorming could help to initiate an interactive process to assess what works in the policymaking process and what does not, to the extent that efforts are made to improve communication and change policy formulation as soon as possible. This self-awareness on adaptive decision-making in crisis situations could add room for manoeuvre to implement the results and support new courses of action. In time of crisis, traditional models of evidence-informed policy and procedural mechanisms could be complemented with adaptive decision-making models because crises (such as the COVID-19), characterised by radical uncertainty and suffocating ambiguity, lack scientific knowledge. Decisions in this case require rapid and provisional assessment of the situation and immediate action. Action taken on the ground will represent matter for future feedback only ex post facto. Metacognitive function improvement is a useful tool to manage complex situations. All the actors from scientists to politicians to diplomats will benefit from self-reflexivity, becoming aware of dysfunctional beliefs, cognitive biases, and importance of trusting more their tacit knowledge and the profound value of peer cooperative processes.",

            "text": "The post-traumatic COVID-19 growth (PTCG) will need a tremendous multidisciplinary effort on behalf of all people in the world, and a sustained effort for the months and years to come to manage uncertainty more than to reduce it. However, to manage uncertainty, we should know how to seek and prioritise information and to coordinate a common action. There is a need to cooperate and interface with all operators in the field: doctors, nurses, sanitary operators, scientists, experts, policymakers, diplomats, communicators, entrepreneurs, managers, stakeholders at the large, etc. Very often it is important to receive feedbacks from someone whose role in the process could be summed up by these words: \"if you want to know if the elephant at the zoo has a stomach ache, don't ask the veterinarian, ask the cage cleaner\". People who clean up messes become attuned to circumstances that change the amount of mess there is (Sapolsky 2004, p. 329 ). This brings with it the necessity to listen, motivate, influence, and cooperate, a set of interpersonal skills with which leaders (in all fields) are generally not very familiar. Instead, in order to set up policy formulation and policy evaluation mechanisms we have to involve the people with a bottom-up approach. There is a need to understand how people think, feel, and are motivated and this requires awareness and empathy skills on behalf of policymakers. It is precisely cooperation and not competition that has allowed complexity to evolve. Science diplomacy really needs an implemented cooperation at first between scientists, policymakers, and then stakeholders. The act of willing to cooperate implies the ability to perceive the other as fundamentally \"similar\" to oneself in the intentionality. Therefore, the joint engagement on a problem establishes an essentially equal interpersonal perception, which is the fundamental characteristic of cooperative motivation and implemented results (Liotti 2001). Without a serious reflection on ourselves, the world, and our interaction with the world, we cannot hope to produce sustainable evidence-informed policymaking. An interaction between people requires joint attention, a common concentration; otherwise we risk communicational chaos. Herbert Simon (1977) , writing about the new world saturated with information, warned us more than 40 years ago of how this information consumes the attention of those who receive it, so that a wealth of information produces a poverty of attention. Unfortunately, the very volume of information we deal with every day leaves us too little time to reflect on its real meaning. In a period of crisis like the present one, the proliferation of sources of information in and of itself leads people to peaks of anxiety precisely because there is no time to reflect. The problem is that too much information disperses attention and gets the opposite effect: people do not understand well and the message you want to send is not received or is misperceived. Policymakers are themselves overwhelmed by the information and under constant pressure and in time of crisis this state of the art is compounded. We live in an ambiguous and uncertain world with lights and shadows. There are people who see very well in the light, but those with real experience are able, because of their inherent knowledge, to look, understand, and act even in the shadows. Here it comes to the fore the tacit knowledge that is the ability to do things without being able to explain how. It is about perceptual skills, workarounds, pattern matching, judging typically, and mental models (Klein 2009). Tacit knowledge is critical for the way we design and use procedures in complex situations. But tacit knowledge resists scrutiny and evaluation. Therefore, it is susceptible to biases. And this in politics, as in the private sector, influences planning and risk management, problem-solving, and adaptive decision-making processes. Decisions depend on how we perceive situations, how we explain them, and how much we learn from events (our experience). Experience together with the ability to mentalise (the awareness that our and other people's behaviour is not detached from intentional mental states) makes us more resilient and allows us to store situations and experience in our brain, as it makes us more efficient in the future in solving problems and making decisions. This is where experience is irreplaceable. Most of the advice offered is about how to think and decide when the issues are straightforward. But we do need to explore how we think and decide in the world of shadows, the world of ambiguity. New generations should be aware of statistical and analytical methods' limits to recognise the value of experience and credibility that comes with age, and to \"take advantage\" of the tacit knowledge that \"seasoned\" experts have and that no book or article can ever give them. Cooperation can help us all build something new together and share knowledge on the field: from the leader to the scientists, to the operators, and to the normal citizen. This is the era of greater individual and shared responsibility to rebuild a more resilient and stronger community.",

The Italian Society of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO) identified the need of practice recommendations on logistic issues, treatment delivery and healthcare personnel's protection in a time of limited resources. A panel of 15 national experts on HNCs completed a modified Delphi process. A five-point Likert scale was used; the chosen cut-offs for strong agreement and agreement were 75% and 66%, respectively. Items were organized into two sections: (1) general recommendations (10 items) and (2) special recommendations (45 items), detailing a set of procedures to be applied to all specific phases of the Radiation Oncology workflow. The distribution of facilities across the country was as follows: 47% Northern, 33% Central and 20% Southern regions. There was agreement or strong agreement across the majority (93%) of proposed items including treatment strategies, use of personal protection devices, set-up modifications and follow-up re-scheduling. Guaranteeing treatment delivery for HNC patients is well-recognized in Radiation Oncology. Our recommendations provide a flexible tool for management both in the pandemic and post-pandemic phase of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Not only patients diagnosed with HNC are often comorbid and frail [2] [3] [4] , but may have specific features increasing their risk of being more severely affected by COVID-19 infection [5] . Treatment-related sequelae, including but not limited to the presence of tracheostomy [5] and the myelosuppressive action of chemo-and radiotherapy (RT) [6] , further increase the threat of the pandemic on these patients' health. RT represents a mainstay in HNC, both in the definitive and in the post-operative setting [7] . While the unprecedented COVID-19 emergency is requiring health care professionals to redefine treatment paradigms, there is a general agreement on three basic principles for HNC management in Radiation Oncology: (1) curative-intent RT should be considered as non-deferrable [8] , (2) treatment breaks should be minimized to preserve patients' outcomes [9, 10] , and (3) maintenance of adequate quality standards should be guaranteed, especially when highly conformal techniques are used [7, 8] .",

Indeed, although hypofractionated schemes may be proposed, 20 is the lowest currently accepted number of fractions for curative-intent treatments [8] . Therefore, the choice to address to mini-invasive surgery would have the advantage to prevent patients from multiple accesses to the hospital and therefore limit the risk of crosscontamination. Considering the palliative setting [8] , the prescription of extreme hypofractionation (even in a single fraction of 8 Gy) could optimize the ratio between the risk of infection and the expected benefits of irradiation.",

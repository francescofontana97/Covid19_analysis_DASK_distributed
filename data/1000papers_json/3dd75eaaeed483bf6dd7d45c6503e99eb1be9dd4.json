In the present paper, we analyze the importance of innate immunity on SEIS modeling. We propose an SEIS model with Holling type II and type III functions representing innate immunity. We find the existence and stability conditions for the equilibria. When innate immunity is in the form of Holling type II function, the disease-free equilibrium exists for reproduction number less than unity and is locally asymptotically stable, and supercritical transcritical (forward) as well as subcritical transcritical (backward) bifurcation may occur where the contact rate \u03b2 = \u03b2 * acts as the bifurcation parameter. Hence, disease-free equilibrium need not be globally stable. For reproduction number greater than unity unique endemic equilibrium exists which is locally asymptotically stable. The global stability conditions for the same are deduced with the help of Lozinski\u020b measure. When innate immunity is considered a Holling type III function, the disease-free equilibrium point exists for reproduction number less than unity and is locally as well as globally stable. The existence of either unique or multiple endemic equilibria is found when reproduction number is greater than unity, and there exists at least one locally asymptotically stable equilibrium point and bistability can also be encountered. The conditions for the existence of Andronov-Hopf bifurcation are deduced for both cases. Moreover, we observe that ignoring innate immunity annihilates the possibility of Andronov-Hopf bifurcation. Numerical simulation is performed to validate the mathematical findings. Comparing the obtained results to the case when innate immunity is ignored, it is deduced that ignoring it ends the possibility of backward bifurcation, Andronov-Hopf bifurcation as well as the existence of multiple equilibria, and it also leads to the prediction of higher infection than the actual which may deflect the accuracy of the model to a high extent. This would further lead to false predictions and inefficient disease control strategies which in turn would make disease eradication a difficult and more expensive task. a",

Moreover, it is a potent method to explore the wide range of communicable diseases which in turn helps in a better understanding of disease dynamics and further helps in constructing the disease control policy which includes emergency planning, risk estimation, and the economic aspects for a healthy environment. Many researchers, in the past, have formulated various epidemiological systems (SIS, SI, SIR, SEIR, SIERS, SEIVR, etc.) with distinct treatment procedures to keep the disease in control [4, 12, 26, 39, 45, 46] . The famous SIR compartmental system was formulated by Kermack and McKendrick [23] in 1927. He studied the Great Plague outbreak during 1665-1666 in London, and the Mumbai outbreak of plague in 1906. SEIR models are capable of representing many human contagious diseases such as mumps, SARS, ebola, TB, pox, flu, measles, and HIV. Adding one extra compartment known as the exposed compartment (E) to the SIR model leads to the SEIR model. This compartment consists of the people that are in the latent phase or incubation phase, that is, they are infected but not able to spread the infection. When the time of acquired temporal immunity is small compared to the major time scale or there is no temporal immunity to disease after recovery, the system changes to the SEIS compartmental model.",

Ouaro [34] propose the SEIS model with exponential growth in population. They consider two distinct autonomous ordinary differential equation systems for two different scenarios: without treatment and with treatment. They find that the disease can play the role of a regulator of the population. Ilnytskyi et al. [21] perform computer simulation studies of the SEIS cellular automaton epidemiology model by considering distinct fractions for the exposed E and infectious I individuals for explicit accounting of the incubation period of infection. They find that the time required to get to an equilibrium state diverges when we approach the critical curing rate. The initial stage of the infection growth shows porous clusters of infectious individuals with exposed individuals decorated on their surface. Qingmei [8] study the stochastic SEIS epidemic model with degenerate diffusion. They linearize the model in Stratonovich form and by solving the corresponding three-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation obtain the density function around the endemic equilibrium. Lu et al. [30] study the influence of media coverage on the dynamics of infectious diseases, that is, they include behavior changes in the contacts of individuals due to the impact of media coverage. They observe that the media coverage may lessen the maximum value of the infected or the average number of the infected in different cases, while for large reproduction number, the impact of the media coverage can also cause an increase in the average number of the infected. This further causes challenges in control and prevention strategies for communicable diseases.",

            "text": "The significance of the innate immunity to our survival while encountering a wide range of disease-causing pathogens is catastrophically illustrated by the disastrous consequences of the immunological weakening due to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and congenital immunological deficiencies such as SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) in infants. The difference in the outcomes among different individuals after the infection is the major motivation for studying the role of innate immunity. These differences may in part be described by the capability of diverse innate host defense mechanisms or simply by natural immunity. The studies so far support the materiality of innate immunity. The reason why not every person who comes in contact with a carrier always gets infected and variable latent periods in different individuals suggest the significance of immunity. Phagocytosis, cytokine production, immune recognition, and effector mechanisms may all contribute to innate immunity. The major research on this topic done so far is on the cellular level. Shi et al [37] studied the sepsis disease model with innate and acquired immunity. Pigozzo et al [35] constructed the computational model of the innate immune system. Kumar et al [25] presented an inflammation model consisting of three ODEs and suggested some therapeutic strategies based on the sensitivity analysis. Reynolds et al [36] further extended their work to study the influence of time on the host defense mechanism. For further work on the cellular level study of innate immunity refer [1, 11, 14, 38, 41, 43, 44] . Not a very large number of researchers have worked on compartmental epidemiological models with innate immunity, and it is mostly ignored. Heffernan et al [16] combined the immunological and epidemiological models for the study of measles infection. They studied in detail the relationship between disease incidence, waning immunity, and boosting. Banerjee et al [3] constructed an immuno-epidemiological model of two-stage epidemic growth. They considered the fact that the increase in the number of infectious individuals hinders the effect of innate immunity due to the increase in viral load. Mwalili et al [33] constructed an SEIR model for COVID-19 disease where they consider the role of innate immunity in recovering from exposed to susceptible class. Another motivation for studying innate immunity is the fact that a very small number of such models is available in the literature as the majority of existing models are adaptive immunity focused. Hence, it becomes important to study whether innate immunity is an important factor or not while studying the dynamics of an infectious disease.",

The research available on compartmental epidemiological models concerning innate immunity mostly assumes it to be linear while an increase in the number of infectives will further boost the number of exposed individuals, as well as the viral load. Hence, we consider the nonlinear form of natural immunity as Holling type II and type III functions which considers the effect of an increase in the viral load as it depends on the exposed population. This manuscript is quite important to the researchers working in the field of compartmental modeling of infectious diseases as the majority of researchers disregard the significance of innate immunity in the process of infection spread. This research focuses on the role of innate immunity and the effects of ignoring it so that in the future it could help in more precise and effective modeling.",

Section 2 deals with the mathematical analysis of the model. In this section, the boundedness and positivity of the solutions are proved and the reproduction number is calculated. We further deduce the conditions for the existence and stability of the equilibrium points. In the next section, simulations of the system are carried out to validate our mathematical findings numerically, while Section 4 discusses the fatality of ignoring innate immunity. The last Section summarizes the paper as a conclusion.",

We perform the simulation with the help of various sets of parameters as illustrated in the following examples: Using Ruth-Hurwitz criterion, we deduce that the equilibrium point E 1 is unstable while E 2 is locally stable. This is shown in Fig. 3a . Using Jacobian matrix, one can easily deduce that E 1 and E 3 are locally asymptotically stable while E 2 is an unstable EE. Hence, the system encounters bistability. This is represented in Fig. 4a. . We notice that the basic reproduction number is same as previous example, but the number of equilibria differ. Here, the system (1.2) has unique endemic, E 1 = (36.7305, 63.0416, 0.0759537) which is stable as shown in Fig. 4b . Figure 3a shows the existence of backward bifurcation, that is, the EEs exist even when R 0 is less than unity. This means that the infection can persist even when the reproduction number is less than unity, which in turn creates difficulty in eradicating the disease. Figure 3b shows the existence of unique EE when R 0 > 1. Figure 4a shows the existence of multiple equilibria when R 1 0 is greater than unity, due to which a small perturbation in the system can change the complete dynamics making it somehow unpredictable. A small change in the initial condition could lead to the convergence to a different EE. We also observe that Examples 3.2 and 3.3 above have the same values for parameters except for \u03b1 and hence have the same reproduction number. Figure 4b shows the existence of unique EE for same value of reproduction number as 4a but different value of parameter \u03b1. Therefore, when h(E) is a Holling type III function, a change in the value of the parameter \u03b1 can easily change the properties of the system keeping the basic reproduction number exactly the same.",

A change in initial condition could lead to the convergence to a different EE. Moreover, for the same parameter values, when innate immunity is considered as a Holling type II function, there exist two endemic equilibria E 1 = (96.4471, 3.54006, 0.00426513) and E 2 = (42.0801, 57.7113, 0.0695317) which is again quite different from what we obtained while ignoring immunity. We observe that the total infected population is higher when innate immunity is ignored. Hence, the ignorance of innate immunity alters the actual scenario to a very high extent and leads to wrong predictions. Figure 7 shows the effect of innate immunity on the susceptible, exposed, and infected population. Moreover, as we have seen, when h(E) is a Holling type II function, the system may exhibit backward bifurcation, while for \u03b1 = 0, no such bifurcation occurs. When ignoring immunity, one would try to push the reproduction number below unity for disease eradication, but in the actual scenario, the disease may still persist due to the existence of backward bifurcation.

This research becomes quite important as it shows that innate immunity is as important as acquired and adaptive immunities. This would encourage the researchers to include innate immunity as an important factor while formulating a model as disregarding it can result in various modeling disasters since it has the power to change the disease dynamics drastically. Not much research is present in the literature regarding the use of innate immunity in compartmental epidemiological modeling.

The existence of backward bifurcation makes disease eradication a difficult task since pushing reproduction number below unity becomes insufficient for disease eradication. Moreover, the existence of multiple equilibria causes uncertainty in the prediction of disease dynamics. Also, ignoring innate immunity annihilates the possibility of Andronov-Hopf bifurcation as well as bistability. Moreover, it shows higher infection than the actual and leads to wrong predictions.

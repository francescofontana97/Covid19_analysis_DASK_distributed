Allocation assignment was concealed from investigators and participants because the study medicine and placebo were similar in appearance: Both were white oblong tablets dispensed in opaque bottles. Study medication was shipped overnight to participants by commercial courier. Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed at 800 mg (4 tablets) once, then 600 mg (3 tablets) 6 to 8 hours later, then 600 mg (3 tablets) once daily for 4 more days (5 days in total). This dose was chosen on the basis of simulations that used previously published pharmacokinetic parameters and were designed to rapidly achieve and maintain a hydroxychloroquine concentration above the estimated half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) for SARS-CoV-2 (12) . Simulations estimated that 94% of participants would achieve concentrations above this EC 50 value on day 1 and that concentrations would be maintained for 10 to 14 days. Placebo tablets of folic acid, 400 mcg, were prescribed as an identical regimen for the control group. In Canada, the placebo tablets were lactose. If gastrointestinal upset occurred, we advised dividing the total daily dose into 2 or 3 doses.",

Without unblinding of treatment allocation or analysis of the data, the principal investigator proposed to the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) that we modify the primary end point to the change in overall symptom severity over 14 days as longitudinally measured on a 10point visual analogue scale. The DSMB approved the change on 24 April 2020. The change was necessary because the low event rate of hospitalizations or deaths in the trial would have required increasing the sample size to 6000 participants, which was not attainable. With enrollment of at least 200 participants per group, we determined that the revised trial would have 90% power (with a 2-sided \u2423 level of 0.05) to detect a statistically significant difference between the groups for a change in symptom severity score as small as 0.25 points on the 10-point visual analogue scale.

Of those receiving placebo, 70% reported no COVID-19 symptoms by day 14 of the study, 96% had not been hospitalized, and 99.6% survived. The change in symptom severity was not statistically significant: only a 12% relative improvement over placebo. For comparison, oseltamivir in influenza showed a 25% to 35% relative reduction in symptom severity score in clinical trials (16, 17) . Therefore, the modest clinical effect that practitioners ascribe to oseltamivir is still twofold greater than that observed with hydroxychloroquine. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial investigating treatment of COVID-19 among outpatients (a search of PubMed and MEDLINE on 24 June 2020 for publications in all languages using the keyword COVID-19 revealed no published outpatient randomized clinical trials). This builds on other randomized trial data on hydroxychloroquine, which have not shown any benefit for postexposure prophylaxis or for treatment of hospitalized patients (11, 18, 19) . In addition, after this trial was completed, in vivo animal models have reported no hydroxychloroquine activity against SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters, ferrets, or nonhuman primates (20 -22) .",

Validated scoring instruments for symptom severity were not yet available for outpatients with COVID-19 Mean change from baseline and estimated difference from a longitudinal mixed model adjusted for baseline severity score. P values for trend of continuous variables are in parentheses. Subgroups were defined a priori in the protocol. The final diagnosis includes all diagnostic testing results during the study period. Probable diagnosis is based on the U.S. clinical case definition (10) . The final diagnosis categories are hierarchical as listed (and thus mutually exclusive). Participants with symptom duration of 1-2 d before enrollment in the hydroxychloroquine group had a larger reduction in symptom score than those receiving placebo, but this was not observed in those who enrolled with symptom durations <1 d, where one might expect an even greater effect if hydroxychloroquine therapy helped mitigate disease severity if started very early in the disease course. Additional post hoc subgroups of medication adherence, zinc, and vitamin C are presented in Supplement when we designed this trial. Although the visual analogue scale is a subjective measure, the within-person measurement of symptom severity is internally consistent over time. For our outpatient trial, time to resolution of an individual symptom was not considered appropriate because individuals presented with differing symptoms. For example, 65% had cough, and 38% had fever. In addition, some isolated symptoms, such as fatigue, may persist after the overall syndrome subsides. Thus, we believe that the intraperson change in overall symptom severity over time represents a clinically meaningful end point, particularly in a disease that exhibits such heterogeneous symptomatology. Using a continuous end point results in smaller sample sizes than required for categorical or ordinal end pointsthereby expediting phase 2 trials and allowing early assessment of potential clinical benefit. Our original end point was an ordinal outcome of reduced hospitalization, intensive care unit stay, or death. Among the enrolled participants, the incidence of hospitalization was only 3% and incidence of death only 0.4%, making the planned analysis of the ordinal end point futile. We do note that 8 COVID-19 -related hospitalizations (including 1 death) occurred with placebo versus 4 COVID-19 hospitalizations (and 1 additional death; 5 events in total) with hydroxychloroquine. Our population was relatively young with 77% of participants being aged 50 years or less, with few comorbid conditions; thus, our trial findings are most generalizable to such populations. It is possible that hydroxychloroquine is more effective in populations at higher risk for complications, such as older persons in long-term care facilities (23) . Performing randomized trials in long-term care facilities could test whether hydroxychloroquine can reduce hospitalizations; however, the risk for medication adverse effects and drug-drug interactions will also be higher (24) .",

The trial began on 22 March 2020, when PCR testing supplies were severely limited in the United States with outpatients ineligible for testing or with frequent delays in receiving test results. We countered this by enrolling participants with known epidemiologic links to index cases with PCR positivity and proven high-risk exposures. The use of epidemiologic linkage to enroll symptomatic persons is both a limitation and a strength. Although these persons did not have PCR-confirmed diagnoses, using epidemiologically linked cases enabled rapid enrollment after symptoms began: 56% of participants enrolled within 1 day of symptom onset. Only 16% of participants contributing data to the primary end point had a confirmed negative result on a PCR test; this falls within the known false-negative rate of current molecular techniques (8) . In subgroup analyses, participants with epidemiologic linkage or probable COVID-19 by case definition only had similar responses to those with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. PCR-confirmed cases had the least effect observed.",

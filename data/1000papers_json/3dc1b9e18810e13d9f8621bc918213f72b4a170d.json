The UK extended restrictions on the movement of people; as did other countries when numbers of deaths continued to increase. Sweden in contrast has favoured 'herd immunity', having notably less restrictions on the population, but specific guidance to protect the most vulnerable. The scale of economic interventions too has differed. Initially measures such as statutory sick pay from the first day of absence were put in place to ensure people self-isolated immediately when displaying symptoms. Latterly economic measures served to mitigate the financial pressure on businesses and employees as countries went into lockdown. The size of fiscal input has been relatively large but varied within each country 4 (see Table 1 ). The number of deaths and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expenditure however do not seem to be directly proportionate; e.g. New Zealand have spent 4% of their GDP with 21 deaths as of 20 May 2020, the USA spent 11% with 91 664 deaths, 5 and Sweden (14.9% GDP) has recorded 3 831 deaths. 6", "cite_spans": [{"start": 996, "end": 997, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 753, "end": 760, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Internationally, there is clear intention from governments to protect its people and businesses amidst what is likely to be the biggest recession of our time.

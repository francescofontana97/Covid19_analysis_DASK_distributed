            "text": "A principally new view on the constitution of the Universe, the Solar System, and the Earth on the basis of a correct scientific reading and understanding of the Holy Scripture is proposed alongside with the interpretation of the God's message in the form of the Bible, which is started from the book of Genesis describing the creation of the world and the life of the first peoples and terminated by the prophetic book of Revelation, which tells about the last times and the Second Coming of Christ. Previously, it has been shown by the authors that the first day of creation is the day when the primary foundations of everything, i.e., the cores of the Sun (stars) and planets, which are composed of protons and neutrons in different ratios, were created and the thermonuclear processes were started; the second day is the formation of the Earth's mantle and primary crust, the hydrosphere, and the Earth's atmosphere; and the most important day is the third, when the Earth's crust, the hydrosphere, and the biosphere were formed as the future cradle of humanity. This paper considers 4-6 days of world creation according to the Bible: the fourth day as the epoch of the Cambrian burst of biological diversity emerging on the Earth due to the flaring Sun and the appearance of the second luminary-the Moon; the fifth day is the epoch when transparency of the atmosphere and its nitrogen-oxygen composition caused an evolution burst in the development of terrestrial life, i.e., the appearance of fishes, animals, and birds. Before this moment, the life \"evolved\" at the level of viruses, bacteria, and protozoal algae. In this paper, the main focus is laid on the appearance of viruses as the most mysterious Earth's creatures, which may also be born in the space, have unique properties, and represent the most numerous biological forms able to injure all the types of archaeon organisms up to the human. It has been shown that water is the cradle of life, and its evolution and the development of cell life occurs in it only as a deuterium concentration of 150 \u00b1 50 mg/dm 3 . At different concentrations, water becomes an unsuitable medium for any biological life. As a result of the sixth day, the creation of the Earth was terminated and the foundations and the evolution processes launched by God were laid for the further development of the vegetal and animal world in compliance with biological laws. The events reflected in the Bible are real, the predictions are true, and we merely need to draw the correct conclusions about our past, present, and future.",

After a certain time had passed, he saw that the rivers had resumed their flowing and went down to the other sons of men to reveal that they did not speak and think in that manner as before, and what they had been warned about had happened to them, but they did not remember it. When he tried to talk to them, he realized that they took him for a madman, showing him hostility or compassion, but not understanding. For the first little while, he did not touch new water, turning back to his reserves every day. However, sooner or later, he decided to drink new water, as the behavior and thinking that made him outstanding from the others had made his life unbearably lonely. He drank new water and became like everyone else. He completely forgot about his reserve of other water. The people around him looked at him as a madman who had miraculously cured of his madness.",

From time to time, the Earth planet experiences the periods of essential changes, which leads to a qualitative change in the standard of life and the understanding of our place in it. The synchronization of all the terrestrial processes and rhythms is related first of all with the oscillations of the Earth itself and its water basin. Since all the biological objects contain water, the decisive role in our life is undoubtfully played by its quality, i.e., chemical, physical, and biological components.

This dilemma has emerged from a significant distinction between the consciousness levels of enlightened people and consumer people as two individuals, which are absolutely different from each other in intelligence.

This form of the initial life stage also originates in the space. The number of viruses is currently estimated as several hundreds of thousands. All of them are various and able to mutate and integrate into any cells, where they can be reproduced and control the host cell. It seems to us that immunity to the ambient world, which is the living environment of cells in the water and air and on the Earth, is developed just due to these viruses, which also mutate to give the forms of cells diverse in both their structure and chemical composition. Viruses are a trigger of the entire biological life, so life is infinitely various not only in its form, but also its internal content.",

All these processes rather readily occur under the influence of solar light, which as such has a very broad spectrum from long-wave red light to hard ultraviolet light able to decompose water into very different radical components under conventional terrestrial conditions. This underlies the photocatalytic reactions for the purification and disinfection of almost all the types of water [7] and, most importantly, these reactions have initiated the formation of life from the protozoal prokaryotes to eukaryotes up to the appearance of a human. These reactions are not occasional, but caused by the main Universe Law-synthesis from the simple transformation of elementary particles into the first elements of life, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon, with their further conversion into all the organic molecules in the order of increasing complexity in the structure of atoms and molecules in living organisms from protozoans to Homo sapience.",

A necessary condition for the appearance of life is that water must contain viruses (lat. \"virus\" is \"poison\"), which exist in the open space and synthesized on the Earth in volcanoes at high temperatures from the four elements, such as hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, which are most widely spread both on the Earth and in the space. Due to the law of resonances [3, 4] , they form peptide bonds [-C(O)NH-]. At high temperatures, carbon forms cyclic and polycyclic compounds up to fullerenes, which are observed in the open space. Regular geometric shapes typical for viruses may be very various from a simple linear helical to icosahedral one, but the most widely encountered and optimal are ball-like shapes like coronaviruses. The Earth itself has a similar shape and structure! Virus particles can not be reproduced outside a cell and behave as a biopolymer incapable for self-replication. All the types of viruses have a genetic material with its own set of genes able to evolve: they begin to reproduce themselves and exhibit their biological properties only in the intracellular medium. All of them need a shell, inside which they can take the necessary shape of a microdrop capable for reproduction. Initial viral microparticles can spontaneously get together in an infected cell and be transferred in the ambient medium in the form of aqueous aerosols by means of water droplets. They can not be reproduce in a dry climate in the absence of aqueous aerosols, but may exist in a preserved form for an infinitely long time until turning out in an aqueous medium (with a deuterium content of 150 \u00b1 50 mg/dm 3 ), where they newly become capable for reproduction in water clusters and biological cell of any organism, destroying its biological function. The optimal size of microflora is from 0.1 to 150 \u03bcm. However, the most surprising thing consists in that all the terrestrial biological cells and water have precisely the same sizes.",

The Sun's mass decreases due to the thermonuclear processes of the outburning of hydrogen and helium at a level of 4000000 tons per day in contrast to the processes, which occur on the Earth to increase its volume at a nearly constant mass due to the thermonuclear fusion of elements. CONCLUSIONS Hence, this paper submits a fundamentally new view on the constitution of the Universe, the Solar System, and the Earth on the basis of a correct scientific reading and understanding of the Great Book, the book of Genesis, the Bible, the book of Holy Scripture, and the Old and New Testaments, which were written many thousands of years ago in the language of allegories and prophecies. Particular attention is paid to the role of deuterium in the appearance of life on our planet. The events reflected in the Bible are real, the predictions are true, and we merely need to draw the correct conclusions about our past, present, and future.",

            "text": "Every particle of matter, whatever is its nature, is in motion: this is an axiom; life is movement, although any movement is not life yet. When rotating, our Earth creates a very powerful dynamic electromagnetic field. The Earth's equatorial rotation speed is 1600 km/h. Only two poles-Northern and Southern-are at relative rest, so they look like compressed to each other. The Earth's diameter between the poles is 0.3%, i.e., 40 km smaller than on the equator. The higher is the rotation speed, the stronger is compression, which is purely kinematic and typical for all rotating objects. The equatorial rotation speed of Saturn is 35000 km/h, and its diameter between the poles is already 10% smaller than on the equator. Worldwide flood, water was poured from beneath the Earth's crust and from the sky. Land was splitted into 7 continents, which separated from each other to form the oceans between them. Earth's volume was nearly twice increased to form the mountains on all the continents. Water began to occupy 70% of the total Earth's surface \u2193 Tenth millenium 2000 years BC \u2191 Appearance of the first kingdoms. Prophetic dream of king Nebuchadnezzar about the death of the \"idol\" on the Temple mount and its interpretation. First Golden kingdom, Babylonia (successor of Sumeria), and Egypt were presented as the Golden head of the \"idol\". God reveals the secret of the king's dream \"What will happen in the last days\u2026\" through the prophet Daniel (Daniel 2.28). Characteristically, the riot of life is attenuates from the equator to the poles. Unfortunately, in our opinion, scientists pay insufficient attention to studying the rotation of the inner solid core. We already mentioned above that the \"pole reversal\" of Earth's magnetic fields occurs due to its asynchronous rotation, and the state of biological life immediately depends on the Earth's magnetic field. Our solar System as a whole represents a great plane with the Sun in its center. This poses a very important principal question: if the Mendeleev's Table is a prototype of the Universe, this must result in a very important conclusion that the electrons of chemical elements must also rotate in the same plane about a nucleus for all the elements in a way similar to the arrangement of galaxies-all of them are planar. It is obvious that we must revise at least two sciences-chemistry and physics-and revise the constitution of chemical bonds in different compounds from these viewpoints. We think that the rotation of electrons around a nucleus-s, p, d, f, etc.-must have a planar configuration, alongside with their different hybridization in contrast to the commonly recognized configuration, in which they were assumed to rotate in different planes in a balllike sphere, but this is not observed anywhere in the Universe, which is entirely planar. This problem must be more profoundly considered, as everything in the world is designed in a rational way. The inner structure of atoms, molecules, and different chemical compounds must be similar to the structure of the Universe. The entire world is designed by the same laws as evidenced by the magic book Bible.",

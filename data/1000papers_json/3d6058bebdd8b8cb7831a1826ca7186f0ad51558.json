New research, released in 2020, confirmed that the elimination of illicit cigarettes in 36 countries with solid data from independent sources on illicit trade would reduce total cigarette consumption by 1.9%.

In the first phase, the working group studied the T&T system in various countries, but then focused more narrowly on Kenya, Brazil and the European Union. This led to the drafting of a detailed legal proposal for the T&T administration and infrastructure followed by the stakeholders' engagement. The third step is going to involve issuing of new legal provisions and setting up the appropriate administration.

Higher prices motivated 46% of smokers to switch from expensive international brands to the relatively cheaper local/ smuggled brands.

The ITP contains strong measures to control supply chain. But time is running out. The tracking and tracing obligations under the ITP for instance will come into force in September 2023, but many parties still do not have such a system in place, and it takes several years to implement it. A global system is more than the sum of existing domestic systems which do not use the same standards to encode, register or monitor events when the products move along the supply chain globally. The exchange of data globally between parties will only be possible if a decision is taken to establish the global information-sharing focal point at the next MOP in November 2021.",

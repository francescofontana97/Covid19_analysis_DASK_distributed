Methods. The present study was conducted with the medical records of 300 patients positive for coronavirus disease 2019, hospitalised between 28 March and 15 August 2020. The patients were divided into two groups regarding the presence or absence of dysgeusia symptoms. Results. Fever and sore throat rates, and the mean D-dimer level, were considerably higher in the dysgeusia group than in the non-dysgeusia group (32.1 vs 21.6 per cent, p = 0.04; 43.6 vs 20.7 per cent, p < 0.001; and 0.54 \u00b1 0.32 vs 0.49 \u00b1 0.51 mg/l FEU, p = 0.008, respectively). The mean age was significantly lower in the dysgeusia group than in the non-dysgeusia group (42.83 \u00b1 12.31 vs 50.51 \u00b1 13.67 years, p < 0.001). Conclusion. Younger age, fever and shortness of breath could be observed in patients with dysgeusia symptoms. In addition, the D-dimer level was significantly higher in the dysgeusia group.",

            "text": "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid- 19) , which is caused by the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was announced a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. 1 The disease mainly affects the respiratory system and spreads via aerosols released during sneezing and coughing. 2 The main symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, cough, runny nose, nasal congestion, shortness of breath, headache and myalgia. 2, 3 The disease can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms, polymerase chain reaction positivity and the presence of ground-glass opacities on computed tomography (CT) scans. 4 Recent studies have focused on the role of serum inflammatory markers that predict Covid-19, such as lymphocyte counts and C-reactive protein (CRP), homocysteine and D-dimer levels. 5, 6 The levels of ferritin, a crucial immune response mediator, increase in severe Covid-19 cases. 7 Increased ferritin levels could cause a cytokine storm by exerting direct immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory effects. 7 Vitamin D, which affects the nuclear vitamin D receptor, enhances innate cellular immunity by inducing antimicrobial peptides. 8 Vitamin D is thought to reduce the risk of viral infections through several mechanisms, and decreased vitamin D levels have been observed in patients with viral pneumonia. 8 D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product used to exclude the diagnosis of thrombosis. Increased D-dimer levels have been observed in severe Covid-19 cases accompanied by microangiopathy and a hypercoagulable state. 9 In addition to the typical Covid-19 symptoms, recent otolaryngology literature has focused on the association between anosmia and dysgeusia symptoms and the development of minimal-to-mild Covid-19. 10 The assessment of these symptoms does not require any intervention and is easy to perform. Yan et al. reported that patients with taste disorders have a 10-fold higher risk of developing Covid-19. 11 However, there is a lack of evidence about the association between the levels of serum markers predicting disease severity and dysgeusia symptoms. 11 The present study aimed to evaluate the association between serum D-dimer, ferritin and vitamin D levels, and dysgeusia symptoms, in patients with Covid-19.",

The patients in the current study were divided on the basis of the presence of dysgeusia symptoms rather than anosmia symptoms, because the latter could also be affected by other virus-related infections.",

However, no significant decrease in vitamin D levels has been observed in comparative studies. 8 In the present study, no significant difference was observed in ferritin or vitamin D levels between the patient groups.

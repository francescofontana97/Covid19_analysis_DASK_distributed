Underserved populations who live in poverty with limited access to social services across the US are more likely to have underlying medical conditions [8, 9] . Minorities are also among the most vulnerable to the more severe complications of SARS COV-2. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is one of the greatest challenges that we must overcome in the US [10] . Vaccine hesitancy is among the top ten global health threats identified by the World Health Organization in 2019 [11] . This high level of hesitancy is observed in minority communities in light of FDA emergency use authorization of three different vaccines from Pfizer/BioNtech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson-Janssen-Pharmaceuticals (J&J) that have been shown in Phase III clinical trials to be immunogenic, safe, and efficacious [12] [13] [14] . In a study by Coustasse et al., only 25% of AA and 37% of H/L would get a COVID-19 vaccine, compared to 56% of NHW [15] . Experience with racial injustice within the medical establishment has contributed greatly to widespread COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among AA and H/L [16] . Societal and cultural barriers that prevent ethnic minorities from achieving health equity, including vaccine access, are systemic issues that may be addressed only through shifts in governmental policies that can effect substantial changes to combat healthcare inequities. The success of COVID-19 vaccines hinges on high vaccine acceptance and strategies to combat misinformation promoted by the antivax movement [17, 18] . Vaccine hesitancy, misinformation campaign by antivaxxers, and general distrust of the medical establishment could reduce vaccine uptake to a level below that required for establishing herd immunity (Figure 1 ). This review explores various issues and consequences associated with vaccine hesitancy among minority populations in the US, as well as strategies for combating vaccine hesitancy and promoting equity in COVID-19 vaccination.

            "text": "FDA EUA guidance for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is to not administer the vaccines to individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, persons with a history of anaphylaxis should be observed for 30 min rather than 15 min after COVID-19 vaccinations for both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines [29] . Even more, leading women's health care organizations and government health authorities have recommended that Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines be offered to those women who are pregnant and or breastfeeding because the potential benefits of maternal vaccination during pregnancy and or lactation outweigh the risks [30] . In a study performed by Shimabukuro et al., who examined 35,691 women v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age that identified as pregnant, injection site pain was the most frequently reported by pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women. Among 3958 pregnant women enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) experienced pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester) [31] . Although no neonatal deaths were reported, adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%) [31] . Even more, although not directly comparable, there appeared no significant difference in adverse events and neonatal outcomes compared to other studies with similar cohorts before the COVID-19 pandemic. Anaphylaxis at a rate of 11.1 per million doses has been reported for the Pfizer vaccine [32] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported for the Moderna vaccine; however, the specific mechanism supporting the allergy and the specific antigen has not been identified. Hypersensitivity-related adverse events were observed in 0.63% of Pfizer and 1.5% of Moderna vaccine trial participants when compared to 0.51% and 1.1%, respectively, in the placebo groups [29] . Anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination is rare. Administration of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson's Janssen (J&J/Janssen) has been associated with adverse events that include pain, redness, and swelling at the site of injection along with fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea. These common side effects were found to be transient and were gone after a few days. However, a pause was recommended by the FDA and CDC after reports of six cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals following administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine was observed. The FDA and CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST, and other sites in the body that included large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs along with thrombocytopenia. Following the review, the FDA and CDC recommended that use of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine resume in the United States, effective 23 April 2021. However, women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been observed.",

Vaccine administrators often collect limited racial data among vaccine recipients, likely resulting in a skewed observation of the vaccinated population. These are some of the factors that lead to reluctance among many AA to get vaccinated and the exacerbation of existing disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. The erroneous belief among AA that they are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection because of the melanin in their skin is among the claims that likely cost many lives at the height of the pandemic [49] . Many AA also do not trust the COVID-19 vaccines developed during OWS because they believe that shortcuts were taken during vaccine development and manufacturing. The social, political, and economic injustices that AA have endured for decades reinforce their distrust of the healthcare system. They also constitute a significant barrier against cultivating trust and confidence among AA towards COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, there is an urgent need for health equity initiatives that can lead to policies that address these problems.",

This jarring racial gap in COVID-19 vaccination continues throughout the US and warrants urgent attention. H/L favor a tight-knit community culture in which they rely on trusted peers and messengers for information to guide their decisions about COVID-19 vaccines. Immigration status also impacts vaccine acceptance among H/L. Undocumented immigrants are reluctant to both test for COVID-19 and receive a COVID-19 vaccine because they want to avoid encounters with immigration authorities. These individuals live in fear for themselves and their families; hence, they will likely remain unvaccinated and transmit the virus to others if they get infected. There is an urgent need for public figures and role models in communities of H/L to help dispel misinformation, misperceptions, conspiracy theories, and myths about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines.",

A recent survey conducted by Com-pariSure reported that 52% of South Africans will not take the COVID-19 vaccines with religion, fear of needles, and unconsented government tracking being reported as the main reasons for not accepting the vaccine [52] . A Zimbabwean COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy survey also found that 50% of Zimbabweans would not accept the COVID-19 vaccine [53] . South African have historically been non-accepting of vaccinations in general. Prominent theologians have warned against COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, which will lead to increased infection rates, hospitalizations, and mortality among African nations. Beliefs held by many religious leaders in South Africans have had a negative impact on mass vaccination programs and have greatly reduced public trust in COVID-19 vaccinations [54]. The similarities in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy are not unlike what is observed in the US. Hesitancy associated with long-standing fear, misinformation, antivaxxer propaganda, religious and political affiliations, and mistrust is share among global communities.",

It is unclear how low-income countries around the world will get equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Strategies to combat vaccine hesitancy on a global scale in a culturally appropriate manner are essential. The global population is connected through international travel and trade.

Clinical students were more likely to participate in a vaccine trial (62 vs. 44%, P = 0.02), while students who expressed trust in health experts were more likely to agree to take the vaccine and have fewer concerns about side effects [56] . Limitations of this study include a low response rate (37%) and a small sample size of students from a single medical school [56] . Nonetheless, this study demonstrates the need to incorporate a curriculum designed to enhance the knowledge of medical students about COVID-19 vaccines and to teach them vaccine counseling skills.",

Therefore, it is essential that communities throughout the US have a high rate of vaccine acceptance in order to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in a timely manner.",

            "text": "COVID-19 vaccination among children (up to 17 years of age) in the US is essential to curbing the pandemic. Unfortunately, this strategy is problematic due to vaccine hesitancy among parents. Parents who are hesitant about COVID-19 vaccines are also less likely to allow their children to be vaccinated. According to the 2010 Census, there were 74.2 million people under the age of 18 in the US (24% of the total US population) [68] . This would represent nearly a quarter of the population that would require COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, vaccination of this portion of the US population is essential to attaining herd immunity ( Figure 1 ). Importantly, children constitute an infection reservoir even though infected children are usually asymptomatic. Comprehensive data on the transmission of viral variants among children are lacking, and new clinical trials that include children are still in their early stages. There is a great need for a national interventional education and awareness campaign that educates parents and children about the importance of getting a COVID-19 vaccine. There is also a great need for more research and larger case-control trials involving children, including those with underlying medical conditions.",

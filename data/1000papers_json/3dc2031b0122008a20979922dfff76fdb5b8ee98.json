The pooled percentage of pre-symptomatic infection among 180 initially asymptomatic patients is 48.9% (95% CI: 31.6-66.2%). The pooled proportion of asymptomatic infection among 1152 COVID-19 children from 11 studies is 27.7% (95% CI: 16.4-42.7%), which is much higher than patients from all aged groups. Abnormal CT features are common in asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. For 36 patients from 4 studies that CT results were available, 15 (41.7%) patients had bilateral involvement and 14 (38.9%) had unilateral involvement in CT results. Reduced white blood cell count, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and increased C-reactive protein were also recorded. Conclusion: About 15.6% of confirmed COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic. Nearly half of the patients with no symptoms at detection time will develop symptoms later.",

A study from Germany also demonstrates the importance of serological tests in COVID-19. In 5/316(1.6%) healthcare workers SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies could be detected. Four of the five subjects were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR. One subject was not tested via PCR since he was asymptomatic 55 .

Meanwhile nearly half of the patients who were asymptomatic at screening time may develop symptoms during follow-up. Our results also show that there is no significant difference in the percentage of asymptomatic infection between studies conducted in China or other countries. Meantime, 11 studies whose research objects are children, got a pooled asymptomatic proportion of 27.7% among confirmed cases. This result is much higher than the result obtained from all aged groups. Many viral infections are associated with asymptomatic, subclinical, or very mild symptoms. Influenza was estimated to be 5.2-35.5% 48 . Asymptomatic infections were also reported during SARS and MERS. Our result of asymptomatic proportion is lower than in many independent studies. In the study conducted by Nishiura et.al estimating the asymptomatic ratio of COVID-19 by using the information on Japanese chartered flights evacuated from Wuhan, China, this number was calculated to be 30.8% 19 . This could be explained by the relatively small observation sample size. Pre-symptomatic is common in patients who had no symptoms at diagnosis. Those patients developed symptoms later during follow-up and are easy to be mistakenly classified as asymptomatic patients if the observation time is not long enough, which disturbs Accepted Article figuring out the true burden of asymptomatic infection. In 10 studies containing the number of pre-symptomatic infection, the pooled proportion of pre-symptomatic infection of COVID-19 among no-symptoms patients at screening time is 48.8%. This result indicates that nearly half of the patients who were diagnoses with COVID-19 asymptomatically at screening time may be in their incubation period and develop symptoms later in the nature course of the disease. In a study reporting 55 asymptomatic cases, even admitted asymptomatically, 39 of them developed symptoms and two of them even developed severe COVID-19 during hospitalization 49 . In one extreme case, an asymptomatic patient did not show any symptoms of COVID-19 until her sudden death due to arterial and venous thromboembolic events of COVID-19 50 .Studies showed that most children's cases were less severe than adults. The main reason why the majority of children had a benign course of illness with mild respiratory symptoms is still unknown. This may be explained by host factors. Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the main means of pathogenesis, is significantly lower in children than in adults. Moreover, children's immune function is less mature than adults with a blunt immune response in SARS-CoV2 infection. This may highlight a possible likelihood of underestimation of children COVID-19 patients, owing to the not so ideal performance of current screening strategy relying hugely on clinical symptoms to detect COVID-9. Some studies also showed that the median age of asymptomatic patients is younger than the symptomatic patients26 . The elderly and pregnant women also showed higher proportions of asymptomatic infection in our subgroup meta-analysis. Reasons may be explained by the relatively small sample size of these two types of patients.Special immune system states may also be a possible reason for this phenomenon.Clinical manifestations of asymptomatic patients show that most asymptomatic patients were moderate in their clinical manifestations and stay asymptomatic until their RNA testing turned negative. Some transient symptoms were recorded in some studies.In the study conducted by Lee et.al, acute anosmia or ageusia was observed in 15.7%Accepted Article(367/2342) patients with asymptomatic-to-mild disease severity owing to damage to the olfactory nerve during invasion and multiplication of SARS-CoV-2 4 . An asymptomatic patient can also have a transient high temperature 51 or a slightly dry cough during illness52 . COVID-19 patients may show varying degrees of laboratory abnormalities, e.g. leukopenia, increased lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocytosis, lymphopenia, etc. We still don't know whether there are differences in laboratory test results between asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients. Though imaging examination could be a potential approach to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Even without clinical features, some asymptomatic patients do have abnormal CT features indicating pulmonary involvement 53 , which is mainly patchy shadowing and GGOs, demonstrating that chest CT method could be helpful to screen asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. IgG and IgM levels of the patients showed a gradually increasing trend during COVID-19.",

The study conducted by Hu et.al certificated that asymptomatic carriers can result in person-to-person transmission and should be considered a source of COVID-19. Case 13 in that study transmitted the virus to his cohabiting family members and one of the infected individuals developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia59 . In a family cluster report, the index patient is asymptomatic during hospitalization60 . A familial cluster of 5 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Anyang, China, had contact with an asymptomatic family member before their symptom onset 61 . Pre-symptomatic patient can also transmit the virus by close contact 62 . Laboratory screening tests should be regarded as part of active case monitoring and contact investigations. When asymptomatic patients are identified, it is better to put the patients under monitor. There are highlights in our studies. First, by using logit transversion of the original data, the pooled proportion of asymptomatic infection was more accurately estimated. Besides, the pooled percentage of pre-symptomatic infection in patients without symptoms at screening point was also analyzed in the 10 studies containing the detailed information. Meanwhile, there are limitations to our study. First of all, some including studies' observation time were not long enough or didn't record negative PCR results of patients. This may lead to some pre-symptomatic cases to be mistaken for asymptomatic patients. Second, recalling bias may exist, some studies recorded symptoms of patients mainly basing on self-reporting. Some asymptomatic patients may have symptoms before screening and thus symptomatic person might have failed to report mild or subclinical symptoms after symptoms resolved. Third, serum viral conversion time and treatments are not available in many articles, making it's hard to conclude whether Accepted Article asymptomatic patients are more likely to clear virus shedding in organs and whether those patients with slightly clinical manifestations should undergo routine treatment or should only take quarantine till recovery. More studies are needed to get a comprehensive understanding of asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 to guide the prevention measures employed in the real-world.",

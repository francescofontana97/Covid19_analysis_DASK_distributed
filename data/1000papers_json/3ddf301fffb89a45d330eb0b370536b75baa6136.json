Dentists have been highly affected by such measures, as they represent an easy source of contagion. As perceived job insecurity is associated with psychological distress and Italian dentists have been highly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of potential financial loss and the risk of being infected, this study aimed at assessing whether the fear of COVID-19 moderated the effect of perceived job insecurity on depressive symptoms. This cross-sectional online study has included 735 Italian dentists recruited during the lockdown and ranging in age from 27 to 70 years old (495 men and 240 women). A quantile regression model with an inference based on the median and with an interaction term between the fear of COVID-19 and perceived job insecurity has been used to estimate the hypothesized associations. The results indicated that both perceived job insecurity and fear of COVID-19 were positively associated with depressive symptoms, and that the effect of perceived job insecurity on depressive symptoms was weaker among those with a low fear of COVID-19.

Among different healthcare professionals, dentists are particularly affected by the risk of being infected by COVID-19, as they not only work in close contact with patients but are also exposed to aerosols and droplets splashing out of the patient's oral cavity [6] . Thus, dentists are also at higher risk of infecting their patients. For these reasons, severe restrictions have been adopted by governments to avoid this source of contagion. In Italy, which is the context of the current study, Italian dentists have been allowed to practice only emergency/urgent procedures during the whole period of the lockdown. Specifically, dental professionals have been urged by the government to suspend all non-urgent appointments to limit the movement of people. This order has meant that all dental hygienists have effectively been suspended from work while many dentists have been left uncertain as to what exactly constitutes emergency care. The Italian Society of Periodontology and Implantology (SIdP) recommends that patients only access dental care if their appointments cannot be deferred. Some examples of dental emergencies of an urgent nature, as identified by the SIdP, include acute pain, infections such as a gingival abscess, and trauma. However, if the patient is at greater risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, shows symptoms or signs attributable to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, or is in quarantine, the treatment should be postponed to a later time.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 154, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 544, "end": 547, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Containment measures (i.e., social distancing, self-isolation, travel restrictions, etc.) adopted to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a reduced workforce across many economic sectors [7] , as well as a general perception of job insecurity [8] , namely the fearful of job loss or worry about job continuation [9] . Perceived job insecurity has been found to be a fundamental stressor during the COVID-19 outbreak [10] , as it has a negative impact on the individual's financial capacity due to the high risk of financial loss [11] . In relation to dentists, a survey conducted by the Irish Dental Association with 369 dentists reported that one-fifth of participants closed their practices temporarily or permanently, and that around three-quarters of the sample expected a financial loss of over 70% amid the COVID-19 outbreak [12] . Similarly, in an Italian survey of 356 dentists, exploring the practical and emotional consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on daily dental clinical practice, it was found that all the participants had closed their practices or had limited their activity only to urgent procedures and that 92.7% of patients had canceled their previously made appointments [13] .

The relationship between perceived job insecurity and negative mental health outcomes is well established in literature [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and might be explained by virtue of the fact that pandemics (e.g., the COVID-19 outbreak) may produce a great uncertainty about the future [39] and even about one's own job, thus causing a temporary economic uncertainty. Indeed, although not directly assessed in the current study, it is plausible to hypothesize that many factors (e.g., the severity of the lockdown measures, the severe containment measures adopted by governments to reduce the risk of contagion within healthcare contexts, the regional economic conditions, the perceptions of alternative work, or the client portfolio of the dentists) may have affected the dentists' perception of job insecurity, creating a strong economic uncertainty. As a consequence, such an economic uncertainty, together with the uncertainty about one's own job and the future in general, may have produced in turn severe psychopathological conditions, such as depressive symptoms [39] . Based on our results, this seems particularly significant with respect to older workers, who have a lower level of perceived occupational mobility and a greater sensitivity to economic insecurity than their younger counterparts [14] , and with respect to those who have a personal knowledge of people who have died due to COVID-19, as mourning may exacerbate depressive feelings. For instance, in a study presenting a mental health first aid service addressed to the general Italian population and health-care providers during the COVID-19 outbreak, Maldonato et al. [40] found that health-care professionals seemed to be less optimistic about their future quality of life than the general population, representing one of the most at risk groups in terms of psychological health. However, our findings showed that low levels of fear of contracting COVID-19 might ameliorate the negative effect that perceived job insecurity may have on depressive symptoms in dentists. As reported above, dentists work in close contact with patients while being exposed to aerosols and droplets splashing out of the patient's oral cavity [6] , and thus they may experience greater levels of fear of being infected by COVID-19. Fear represents an adaptive strategy serving the purpose of protecting oneself against potentially dangerous events. Nevertheless, when fear is disproportionate it may become maladaptive and harmful and can be a component of mental health problems [41] . Our findings suggest that this would be a plausible supposition also in respect of dentists, as a high fear of COVID-19 increases the strength of the effect of perceived job insecurity on mental health problems. Indeed, the COVID-19 outbreak has represented a social situation in which the fear of being infected has dramatically increased levels of negative mental health outcomes [40, 42] . Indeed, the fear of COVID-19 has even exacerbated preexisting stress due to, among other factors, the loss of income and the economic crisis [43, 44] . Moreover, previous studies [43, 44] seem to have already highlighted potential associations between job insecurity, fear of COVID-19, and negative mental health outcomes, but none of these has explored such associations in detail. Considering the severe restrictions under which dentists have been obliged to work, it seems plausible to assert that being infected by COVID-19 could result in a temporary closing of their activity, thus increasing a real economic loss and exacerbating the levels of job insecurity. Furthermore, if we want to continue to consider the perception rather than the reality of job insecurity or loss, according to the social identity theory, people who lose a job, are in quarantine, or are unable to do their job for different reasons (for example, when the government prevents them from doing so because of public health issues, such as during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy), may lack the necessary social confirmation, as well as the psychological and social support and verification, which they usually receive in their workplace thanks to their professional identity [45] . In this scenario, if the necessity for affiliation is high, the psychological distress during the crisis may increase, regardless of any actual job loss.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 343, "end": 347, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 348, "end": 352, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 353, "end": 357, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 358, "end": 362, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 363, "end": 367, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 507, "end": 511, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1291, "end": 1295, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1530, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1865, "end": 1869, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2419, "end": 2422, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2756, "end": 2760, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3145, "end": 3149, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3150, "end": 3153, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3297, "end": 3301, "text": "[43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3302, "end": 3305, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3335, "end": 3339, "text": "[43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3340, "end": 3343, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 4409, "end": 4413, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This study is innovative as it indicates potential psychological paths among Italian dentists leading to perceived job insecurity and so increasing the risk of developing depressive symptoms.

Thirdly, perceived job insecurity was measured through a single-item question. Future studies should consider administering more composite measures, such as the Job Insecurity Scale [46] .

This may alleviate potential financial losses and, at the same time, reduce the fear of being infected. To this end, the governments of some high-income countries (e.g., USA, Canada, and UK) and dental regulatory bodies have offered economic support to dental practices, addressing the financial needs of dentists and alleviating the potential negative effects of financial losses on health and security.

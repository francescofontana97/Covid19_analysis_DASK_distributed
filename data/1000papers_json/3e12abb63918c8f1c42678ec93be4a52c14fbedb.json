Here we analyze viral genome sequences using a phylodynamic model with geographic structure to estimate the origin and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe prior to border closures. Based on SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reconstruct a partial transmission tree of the early pandemic, including inferences of the geographic location of ancestral lineages and the number of migration events into and between European regions. We find that the predominant lineage spreading in Europe has a most recent common ancestor in Italy and was probably seeded by a transmission event in either Hubei or Germany. We do not find evidence for preferential migration paths from Hubei into different European regions or from each European region to the others. Sustained local transmission is first evident in Italy and then shortly thereafter in the other European regions considered. Before the first border closures in Europe, we estimate that the rate of occurrence of new cases from within-country transmission was within the bounds of the estimated rate of new cases from migration. In summary, our analysis offers a view on the early state of the epidemic in Europe and on migration patterns of the virus before border closures. This information will enable further study of the necessity and timeliness of border closures.",

These closures continue to incur high economic and social costs. To weigh the relative costs and benefits of border closures, it will be important to understand the efficacy of these policies. At the early stages of an outbreak, border closures can delay a pathogen's arrival, thereby giving countries additional time to prepare (2). However, the success of this strategy depends on timely implementation and a good knowledge of where the pathogen is already circulating. To evaluate the efficacy of border closures in limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to reconstruct the timeline of the early international spread of the virus, before such policies were implemented.",

By the end of February 2020, the virus was detected in all WHO regions (5) . Currently, several lineages of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are circulating across the globe. The intermixing of these lineages in different countries and regions suggests that the virus has been transmitted across borders many times (6) .",

            "text": "Here we focus on estimating the early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Europe and the virus' migration across European borders. Through national surveillance efforts, the first COVID-19 cases in Europe were detected in France on 24 Jan. 2020 and in Germany on 28 Jan. 2020 (7, 8) . Of the 47 cases detected in Europe by 21 Feb. 2020, 14 were infected in China, 14 were linked to the initial cases in Germany, 7 were linked to the initial cases in France, and 12 were of unknown origin (7) . In addition to the unknown sources of transmission, some early introductions may not have been detected. This is especially probable given that a significant proportion of infected individuals are likely to be asymptomatic (9) . In summary, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the source, number, and timing of SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Europe based on confirmed case data alone. Viral genomes are an important secondary source of information on outbreak dynamics. If viruses acquire mutations on the same timescale as an outbreak, these mutations can provide information about past transmission events. Phylodynamic methods couple a model of viral evolution describing the mutational process to an epidemiological model describing the transmission process. By fitting the combined model to viral genomes sampled from a cohort of infected individuals, we can infer the evolutionary and epidemiological model parameters. Here we fit a phylodynamic model with geographic structure to SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Hubei, China and several European countries before the first borders were closed in these regions. We co-infer the transmission tree linking these sequences, the geographic location of ancestral lineages, migration rates of infected individuals between regions, the effective reproductive number, and the proportion of no-longer infectious cases sequenced in each region.",

Here, we fit a phylodynamic model with geographic structure to full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes to (i) estimate the early patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread into and across Europe, (ii) weigh genomic evidence for competing hypotheses about the geographic origin of the predominant A2a lineage in Europe, (iii) report on the epidemiological parameters, and (iv) compare the rate of new cases arising from within-region transmission versus migration during the early epidemic.",

Under this model, beginning with a single infected host in a single geographic region (deme), the virus can be transmitted from one host to another (a birth event), die out due to host recovery or death (a death event), be sequenced (a sampling event, assumed to correspond to a death event), or migrate from one deme to another (a migration event). The birth, death, sampling, and migration processes are assumed to occur at deme-specific rates that are constant through time. Importantly, this model aims to capture heterogeneity in epidemiological parameters (birth and death rates) and sequencing effort (sampling proportion) among demes. We used a version of the model parameterized in terms of the effective reproductive number, which allows us to additionally infer this epidemiologically relevant quantity for each deme.",

To investigate the earliest outbreaks in Europe, we considered all available sequences collected in France, Germany, and Italy on or before the lockdown of the Lombardy region of Italy on 8 Mar. 2020. These countries had the first detected (France and Germany) and the largest (Italy) early outbreaks in Europe (4, 7) . By limiting sampling to before regional lockdowns and border closures went into effect, we hope to (i) satisfy model assumptions that epidemiological and migration parameters are constant through time, and (ii) get a picture of the early, unimpeded spread of SARS-CoV-2 within Europe. To represent the pool of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in other European countries during this time, we down-sampled sequences from other countries to the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in each country by 8 Mar. 2020 plus one (Table S1 ). We used this quantity as a proxy value roughly proportional to the outbreak size in each country. Table 1 characterizes the sequences analyzed from each deme for the main analysis. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analysis while down-sampling based on confirmed death data from 28 Mar. 2020, considering that deaths occur with a delay after transmission.

In other words, we assume that (i) once a strain was in Europe, the strain could have been transmitted from Europe to other global regions, but subsequent re-introductions of this strain did not occur. Similarly, we assume (ii) strains were not re-introduced into Hubei. These assumptions allow us to ignore sequences from outside of Hubei and Europe. To justify assumption (ii), we argue there was not sufficient time between the pandemic origin in Hubei and Jan. 23, 2020 for a significant amount SARS-CoV-2 export, transmission outside-Hubei, and subsequent re-introduction into Hubei. Furthermore, confirmed case data shows that Hubei province was the epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic until this time, with comparatively less transmission occurring outside of the province than within it (4). To justify assumption (i), we tested whether there was evidence for significant migration into European demes by running a separate analysis on A2a SARS-CoV-2 sampled from all global regions (results in supplement).",

When signal in the sequence data is low, e.g. for some migration rates, our prior assumptions determine the magnitude of these rates. To assess the sensitivity of our main conclusions to the prior, we additionally analyzed the same sequences using a lower migration rate prior ( Figure S12B ).

Importantly, these estimates reflect only introductions occurring in the transmission history of the analyzed cases, not the full epidemic.

The sequence data were informative for inferring some, but not all, migration rates. We highlight here only the rates for which the data is the most informative; see Figure S1 for a full comparison of posterior and prior distributions.

Secondly, we report on the prevalence of no-longer infectious cases in each deme as of the collection date of the last analyzed sequence. This quantity can be backcalculated from the estimated sampling proportion (prevalence = # sequences analyzed / sampling proportion). We note that both the sampling proportion and prevalence estimates have large credible intervals ( Figures S3 and S4 ).

Throughout late January to mid-February 2020, cases were sporadically detected in each European region, each of which is associated with a risk of subsequent within-region transmission. Sustained within-region transmission is first evident in Italy in mid-February. Shortly thereafter, sustained within-region transmission occurred in other European countries, in France, and in Germany. By 8 Mar. 2020, the estimated rate of occurrence of new cases from within-region transmission is within the estimated bounds on the rate of new cases from migration for each region considered ( Figure S12A) . We obtain the same qualitative result in our sensitivity analysis using a very different prior on the migration rate ( Figure S12B ). We note that the rates in Figure 2 are underestimates of the rates of new cases arising due to migration or transmission due to the underreporting in the confirmed case data. However, assuming that the amount of underreporting is comparable across regions, we can indeed compare the rates.",

Both transmission routes have almost equal posterior support under our model assumptions (Figure 1 ).

However, the temporal trends suggested by these data are still compelling and robust towards different prior assumptions. We see that under sustained risk of case migration from Hubei, isolated cases were confirmed throughout Europe beginning in late January 2020 but did not immediately cause large outbreaks.

Indeed, wide confidence intervals around internal nodes in the maximum clade credibility tree and low clade support near the tips (Figure 1 ) indicate a high degree of phylogenetic uncertainty. Therefore, it is important that the parameter estimates we report result from integrating over a distribution of potential phylogenies with different geographic locations assigned to ancestral lineages. In comparison, some initial studies that estimated international SARS-CoV-2 spread constructed a median-joining network instead of a phylogeny to account for this uncertainty (16, 31) . In this approach, identical sequences are collapsed to single nodes and edges represent mutational differences. This disregards information from relative sampling times and means that ancestor-descendent relationships are highly dependent on the choice of the network root (32, 33) . Unaccounted-for sampling biases in these analyses may also yield spurious results for the geographic origin of lineages (34, 35) .

However, particularly in the early stages of outbreaks, infected individuals were identified by health ministries via contact tracing (7) . Non-random sampling may be one possible explanation for why we infer markedly different transmission rates in China when analyzing cases from within Hubei (as in this analysis) as opposed to cases exposed in Hubei but sequenced elsewhere (as in our previous analysis (36) ). Furthermore, the multi-type birth-death model assumes that parameters are constant through time and homogenous within demes. As a result, our inferences based on province-, country-, and continent-level demes are only coarse approximations of the true, heterogeneous epidemic dynamics occurring at a local level. In particular, we do not account for a reduction in airline traffic between Europe and China beginning in late January, before borders were closed (37) . Due to these limitations, we focus on estimating and interpreting particular events along the transmission tree of the analyzed sequences (e.g. Table 3 , Figure 1 ) and advise caution when interpreting inferred migration rates ( Figure S1 ).",

So far, such analyses have primarily used line-list data and information on travel networks to estimate SARS-CoV-2 migration patterns (38) (39) (40) . Here we present independent estimates of migration patterns based on genome sequence data. By combining case count data and our estimates for migration and transmission rates, we provide a timeline of early SARS-CoV-2 introduction and spread before border closures were implemented. Despite migration risk from Hubei being on the same order of magnitude as later migration risk from Italy, we only observe sustained outbreaks in other European regions after the onset of sustained within-region transmission in Italy. Finally, before the first border closures in Europe, we estimate the risk of new cases arising from within-region transmission to be within the estimated range for the risk of new migration cases.",

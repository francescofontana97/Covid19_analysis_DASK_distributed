I am not saying the authors are incorrect, just more information needed. I am slightly surprised by the 50% transfusion rate. This is definitely at the high end, especially if Hb < 80 is the trigger. We (IVANOF study) observed just under 30% with an 80g/L threshold (at one week, but most transfusions are within that week). FOCUS had a 40% rate in the restrictive arm (all of whom started at <100).

I've been waiting for the trial results to be reported, so I look forward to seeing those in due course as well. 3) Due to the adverse effects presented by the use of isomaltoside iron, it is convenient to explain the conditions in which the iron will be used. That is, if there is any device in the ward to prevent a possible severe anaphylactic reaction. In this sense, a section should be added concerning the safety and adverse effects related to the use of isomaltoside iron. I also recommend including information from the Spanish System of Pharmacovigilance (SEFV). Specifically, as of July 5, 2017, after a search in different databases and a total of 108 reported cases of serious anaphylactic reactions or serious clinical situations related to anaphylaxis / anaphylactic shock, associated with the administration of any of the iron preparations intravenous. Of those 108 serious notifications, 44 were related to administration of iron isomalt. With the estimation of 5080 patients exposed in 2017 (based on the sales figures of product), the notification rate of severe hypersensitivity reactions (reported cases in relation to treated patients) is far more higher than that estimated for other iron preparations of administration intravenous. Currently, all available data are being analyzed in detail, and as a precautionary measure the Spanish Drug Agency recommends to health professionals not starting any new treatment with iron-isomalt in Spain.",

That is, if there is any device in the ward to prevent a possible severe anaphylactic reaction. In this sense, a section should be added concerning the safety and adverse effects related to the use of isomaltoside iron. I also recommend including information from the Spanish System of Pharmacovigilance (SEFV). Specifically, as of July 5, 2017, after a search in different databases and a total of 108 reported cases of serious anaphylactic reactions or serious clinical situations related to anaphylaxis / anaphylactic shock, associated with the administration of any of the iron preparations intravenous. Of those 108 serious notifications, 44 were related to administration of iron isomalt. With the estimation of 5080 patients exposed in 2017 (based on the sales figures of product), the notification rate of severe hypersensitivity reactions (reported cases in relation to treated patients) is far more higher than that estimated for other iron preparations of administration intravenous. Currently, all available data are being analyzed in detail, and as a precautionary measure the Spanish Drug Agency recommends to health professionals not starting any new treatment with iron-isomalt in Spain.",

We added more details on this event as follows: \"The trial has been suspended between July 24, 2017 till July, 18, 2018, because of new information about safety regarding the IIM, reported by Spanish System of Pharmacovigilance on July 5, 2017 to the European Medicines aAency. Among 108 reported cases of serious anaphylactic reactions or serious clinical situations related to anaphylaxis / anaphylactic shock, associated with the administration of any of the iron preparations intravenous, 44 were related to administration of IIM. Because this signal was not confirmed elsewhere in Europe, the recommendations regarding IIM injection were not modified (neither by the European nor the by the French medicines agencies) and the study was authorized to restart.\" Regarding the precautions taken for IIM injections we also added these information : \"Nurses at each participating centers will learn to identify hypersensitivity reactions including serious and potentially fatal anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions following iron injection, and resuscitation material as well as medical team are available at any time with no delay in case of emergency at all the study centers\". 4) Outcomes measures -With the situation arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, I think it's going to be complicated to analyze the situation of the patients at 90 days. It is advisable to review the following endpoints or to introduce some variable related to the confinement or to the Covid-19: \u2022 Quality of life (QOL) using the variation of EQ-5D score39 from admission to POD30 and POD90 and on perceived QOL with a single overall item from PQOL scale40 from admission to POD7 and POD90. \u2022 Dependencies of patients for daily life activities using the variation of IADL test (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) from inclusion to POD90. \u2022 Safety will be evaluated according to: Death rate from all causes until POD90 This is a great suggestion, we will propose to add the Covid status (infected or not, requiring hospitalization or not) in the eCRF in the next version of the protocol. But this need to be approved by the ethic committee, so we cannot add it in the present manuscript, since it is not stated in the study protocol for the moment.",

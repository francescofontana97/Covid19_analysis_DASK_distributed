A lot of social activities have been halted during the COVID-19 lockdowns, which has evidently enhanced the ambient and indoor air quality. This paper investigates the possible emission sources and evaluates the meteorological conditions that may affect the dispersion and transport of BC locally and regionally. Ground-level equivalent BC (eBC) measurements were performed between January 2020 and July 2020 at a university campus located in Dammam city of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The fossil fuel (eBC ff ) and biomass burning (eBC bb ) fractions of total eBC (eBC t ) concentrations were estimated as 84% and 16%, respectively, during the entire study period. The mean eBC bb , eBC ff , and eBC t concentrations during the lockdown reduced by 14%, 24%, and 23%, respectively. The results of statistical analyses indicated that local fossil fuel burning emissions and atmospheric conditions apparently affected the observed eBC levels. Long-range potential source locations, including Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, distributed zones in the Arabian Gulf, and United Arab Emirates and regional source areas, such as the Arabian Gulf coastline of the KSA, Bahrain, and Qatar, were associated with moderate to high concentrations observed at the receptor site as a result of cluster analysis and concentration-weighted trajectory analysis methods.",

Nowadays, an enormous consumption of non-renewable energy resources by industrial expansion, urbanization, and energy demand has been leading to the deterioration of air quality locally and globally. Black carbon (BC) particles are health-threatening pollutants to human health, particularly in urban cities and industrial areas [1] [2] [3] [5] [6] [7] [8] .

BC particles act as a host to many chemical and physical species during their lifetime (4-12 days) in the atmosphere [14] . Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, having a diameter of around 0.1 \u00b5m, might be carried by BC particles to remote areas [15] . Cluster analysis (CA) of backward air mass trajectories, potential source contribution function (PSCF), and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analyses have been widely practiced to investigate the potential source regions of atmospheric pollutants [3, 12, [16] [17] [18] [19] . The PSCF method's constraint is that the grid cells might indicate identical PSCF values when the concentrations of the targeted air pollutant are slightly or metropolitan area has been classified as \"arid\", since the annual total rainfall is 90 mm. The Air Quality Monitoring Station (AQMS) used in this study is located at the top of the engineering college building on the south campus of Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (26.3955 N, 50 .1978 E) ( Figure 1 ). An aethalometer for measuring BC mass concentrations is installed in the AQMS, which is 15 m above the sea level and 3 km away from the Arabian Gulf. Local anthropogenic emission spots, such as King Abdulaziz Sea Port (the second busiest and largest seaport of the KSA), industrial area #1, and two main arteries with high traffic density (King Abdulaziz and King Fahd roads), are present within the five-km perimeter of the AQMS. Jubail city, known as the largest industrial city in the world, and Qatif city, hosting the oil production field of Saudi Aramco (the Saudi national oil company) and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) petrochemical and chemical company, are the most significant regional industrial emission sources located in the northwestern part of the study area. Furthermore, Al Hofuf city in the southwestern section of the monitoring station accommodates the largest oil fields in the KSA and can be considered as a regional emission source. In this study, the measurements of BC mass concentrations and meteorological parameters were performed between 8 January and 2 July 2020. The obtained dataset was categorized into three phases: before lockdown (Pre-LD) (8 January-22 March), during lockdown (LD) (23 March-20 June), and after lockdown (Post-LD) (21 June-2 July) to find out any potential effects of COVID-19 lockdown countermeasures on ambient BC emissions.

A weatherproof PM10 inlet (M4121, Magee Scientific \u00ae , Berkeley, CA, USA) was installed on the top of the inlet tube. The PM10 inlet tube line with a length of two meters was covered with a temperature-controlled jacket heater to prevent water condensation.

A weatherproof PM 10 inlet (M4121, Magee Scientific \u00ae , Berkeley, CA, USA) was installed on the top of the inlet tube. The PM 10 inlet tube line with a length of two meters was covered with a temperature-controlled jacket heater to prevent water condensation. The possible loading effect due to the aethalometer's filter-based optical method needs to be compensated to obtain accurate ambient eBC concentrations [73, 74] .

The three-day backward trajectories arriving at 500-m height above ground level (AGL) to the receptor study site were computed for every 6 h throughout the whole studied period using the global data assimilation system (GDAS) meteorological data with half-degree resolution and 10,000 m (AGL) of model top height.

Descriptive statistical parameters, such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation (S.D.), minimum (Min.), maximum (Max.), and percentiles, were calculated for both hourly mean values of meteorological parameters and eBC concentrations ( Table 1 ). The relative differences between the mean and median values of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure parameters during the Pre-LD, LD, and Post-LD periods were found to be less than 6%. The mean values of temperature, humidity, pressure, and solar radiation parameters along the LD changed by 59%, \u221224%, \u22121.1%, and 31%, respectively, as compared to the Pre-LD period. The changes in mean wind speed values during the LD and Post-LD periods in comparison with the Pre-LD stage were 3.1% and \u221212.5%, respectively. The comparison of wind speed and wind direction ( Figure 2 ) suggests that the wind data were quite similar throughout Pre-LD and LD periods, while lower wind speeds during the Post-LD might result in higher eBC concentrations due to the atmospheric stability. During the whole study period, eBC bb , eBC ff , and eBC t concentrations varied between 0.01 and 3.6, 0.12 and 13.4, and 0.25 and 14.2 \u00b5g/m 3 , respectively. The eBC concentrations measured within LD phase exhibited the lowest percentile (25th, 50th, and 75th) values. The independent sample comparison t-test was applied to hourly means, medians, and standard deviations of the eBC datasets of Pre-LD, LD, and Post-LD periods. The comparison test results revealed that the measured eBC concentrations (eBC bb , eBC ff , and eBC t ) in each period were statistically different at the 95.0% confidence level.",

Hourly variations in eBC ff concentrations during Pre-LD, LD, and Post-LD indicated distinct bimodal distributions. Within the Pre-LD period, a significant and sharp peak between 5:00 am and 10:00 am was observed for the mean eBC ff concentrations, which reached the maximum value of 3.2 \u00b1 2.2 \u00b5g/m 3 at 8:00 am and then gradually decreased to 1.4 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b5g/m 3 by 2:00 pm. Thereafter, eBC ff concentrations demonstrated a minor peak between 2:00 pm and 7:00 pm and a gradual build-up from 7:00 pm to 5:00 am. The highest eBC ff concentrations within the morning peak are attributed to the emissions resulting from intense vehicular activities during rush hours. The decrease in the eBC ff concentration between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm could be explained by the enhanced unstable atmospheric conditions as a consequence of stronger solar radiation and winds. The afternoon peak and increasing eBC ff concentrations until 5:00 am might be ascribed to two main factors: (i) emissions from heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDTs), which are allowed to enter main arterial roads of the Dammam metropolitan area within the following time intervals: 3:00-5:00 pm and 10:00 pm-5:00 am, and (ii) stable nocturnal atmospheric conditions due to the decreased vertical thermal convection and weakened surface wind speeds. The hourly cycle of eBC ff during the LD phase showed lower concentrations within a narrower distribution in comparison with the Pre-LD and Post-LD stages. The significant and sharp peak between 5:00 am and 10:00 am observed during the Pre-LD period dramatically weakened, which might be ascribed to the imposed lockdown measures. The lowest mean eBC ff concentrations ranging within 1.2 \u00b1 0.7 and 1.1 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b5g/m 3 were noticed between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm. The eBC ff concentrations gradually increased starting from 3:00 pm, reached the maximum mean value of 2.1 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b5g/m 3 at 3:00 am, and displayed a stepwise decline trend until 10:00 am. Shipping activities and HDDT movements continued within the allowed time intervals to supply essential products to the market and public in compliance with COVID-19 safety measures and regulations forced by the KSA. These emission sources and the shallower nocturnal atmospheric boundary layer were the main reasons for the gradual eBC ff concentration build-up between 3:00 pm and 5:00 am during the LD stage.",

The sharp morning peak observed during the Pre-LD phase was less pronounced within the Post-LD period, which could possibly be explained by the suspension of all schools and educational institutions, which drastically reduced the number of vehicles in rush-hour traffic. Boosted traffic activities from the supply chain and logistic disruptions because of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a surge in fossil fuel consumption. The lower mean wind speed and long-range transport might be linked to the increased eBC ff concentrations during the Post-LD period compared to the Pre-LD period.

Monthly changes in eBC ff concentrations are more apparent than those of eBC bb concentrations. The eBC ff concentrations observed in January slightly changed in February by increasing from 2.1 \u00b1 1.1 to 2.3 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b5g/m 3 . Afterward, the mean eBC ff concentration sharply decreased in March by 29.4%, which might presumably be attributed to the imposed measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to February, the change in eBC ff concentrations was most evident in April as a 24-h LD was set nationwide between 6 April and 28 May. The lowest mean eBC ff and eBC bb concentrations were recorded as 1.3 \u00b1 0.6 and 0.26 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5g/m 3 , respectively, in April. During the entire LD period, the public's movement was restricted, except when accessing essential nearby facilities, such as food stores, pharmacies, and hospitals. The previous activities were allowable through obtaining an emergency permit between 6:00 am and 3:00 pm using the official Tawakkalna mobile application. Despite the full LD stringent measures, both eBC ff and eBC bb concentrations observed during May increased by 50.5 and 15.4%, respectively, compared to those measured in April. Besides, the mean eBC t concentration in May was 11% lower than that recorded in February. The mean eBC ff and eBC bb concentrations during June were 2.1 \u00b1 1.2 and 0.29 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b5g/m 3 , respectively, and reverted the levels observed in January as the 24-h LD was partially lifted on 28 May. Domestic heating, burning of crop residues, and forest fires have been reported as primary sources of BCbb emissions, contributing significantly to the BC budget in other regions, such as Brazil [47] , Canada [46] , China [87] , Finland [88] , Greece [89] , India [90] , Italy [91] , Spain [77] , Turkey [41] , and the USA [92] . However, wood-burning stoves in restaurants and open-air barbecues are the only eBCbb sources within the study area and most parts of the KSA, since domestic heating is provided by air conditioners/electric heaters and farms/forested lands are very scarce. The study area's biomass-burning characteristic mentioned herein is the main reason why the ratios of eBCbb concentrations to eBCt concentrations (BBfraction) were estimated as low as 0.16 \u00b1 0.12, 0.17 \u00b1 0.09, and 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 throughout the Pre-LD, LD, and Post-LD stages, respectively. These results suggested that fossil fuel emissions dominated the ambient eBCt budget over the study area by representing 84% of the eBCt concentrations during the entire study period.",

This unexpected increase, especially in eBCff concentrations, after lifting of the LD was most probably derived from (i) exertions for restoring supply-chain losses, such as elevated fossil fuel consumption in transportation and industrial activities, (ii) escalated construction activities in the vicinity of the study area, (iii) more stable atmospheric conditions due to lower wind speed compared to the Post-LD phase, and (iv) long-range transport of BC particles from other regions to the receptor site. Domestic heating, burning of crop residues, and forest fires have been reported as primary sources of BC bb emissions, contributing significantly to the BC budget in other regions, such as Brazil [47] , Canada [46] , China [87] , Finland [88] , Greece [89] , India [90] , Italy [91] , Spain [77] , Turkey [41] , and the USA [92] . However, wood-burning stoves in restaurants and open-air barbecues are the only eBC bb sources within the study area and most parts of the KSA, since domestic heating is provided by air conditioners/electric heaters and farms/forested lands are very scarce. The study area's biomass-burning characteristic mentioned herein is the main reason why the ratios of eBC bb concentrations to eBC t concentrations (BB fraction ) were estimated as low as 0.16 \u00b1 0.12, 0.17 \u00b1 0.09, and 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 throughout the Pre-LD, LD, and Post-LD stages, respectively. These results suggested that fossil fuel emissions dominated the ambient eBC t budget over the study area by representing 84% of the eBC t concentrations during the entire study period.",

The Pearson correlation coefficients between each parameter are shown in Table 2 . Moderate negative correlations were found between wind speed and eBC ff (r = \u22120.445), eBC bb (\u22120.375), and eBC t (\u22120.435) concentrations, suggesting that BC particles were more dispersed under higher wind speeds or that they accumulated at lower wind speeds, as also reported by other studies [33, 88, 93] . The effect of wind direction on eBC t concentrations was further evaluated using bivariate polar plots because of the polar characteristic of wind direction data (between 0 and 360 \u2022 ). Other meteorological parameters did not yield any statistically significant correlations with the measured eBC concentrations. eBC t concentrations resulted in strong positive correlations with eBC ff (0.996) and eBC bb concentrations (0.634), implying that the eBC t composition was mostly represented by the eBC ff fraction during the study period. Bivariate polar plots of concentrations were graphed to find out the conjunct effect of wind velocity and wind direction on hourly mean eBC t concentrations and potential source locations of eBC t emissions affecting the receptor site ( Figure 5 ). It can be inferred from Figure 5a that low wind speeds (<2 m/s) were mostly accompanied by high eBC t concentrations (>4 \u00b5g/m 3 ), revealing that local sources mainly dominated the observed high concentrations during the entire study period. On the other hand, moderate (2-4 \u00b5g/m 3 ) and high (>4 \u00b5g/m 3 ) concentrations were also brought on by high-speed winds blowing from varying directions to the monitoring site, implying the potential contributions of regional and long-range sources to the measured concentrations. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the wind speed and eBC t concentrations were found to be \u22120.674, \u22120.271, and \u22120.515 for the Pre-LD, LD, and Post-LD stages, respectively. These correlation levels could suggest that local sources' effects were more evident in the measured concentrations at the Pre-LD and Post-LD stages.",

During the Pre-LD period, the easterly sectors demonstrated moderate concentrations at variable wind speeds. Contrary to the Pre-LD stage, the effect of westerly winds on eBC t concentrations was less pronounced, which could possibly be due to dramatically reduced traffic volume during the LD. The highest concentrations at low wind speeds and moderate concentrations at variable wind speeds were, instead, associated with the LD's easterly directions. The emissions from cargo ships docking to and hailing from the King Abdulaziz Sea Port, land reclamation activities, and transboundary pollution transport might be the main reasons giving rise to the elevated eBC t concentrations at the receptor site since there are no other known local emission sources on the east section of the monitoring site. Throughout the Post-LD phase, eBC t concentrations showed a distinct distribution on the bivariate polar plot, depicted in Figure 5d . It was observed that intense land reclamation construction activities had started at the sector between NE and SE directions with respect to the monitoring location during the Post-LD period. Diesel-fuel-combustion plumes of heavy-duty excavators and trucks operating on the nearby construction site were carried to the monitoring site by low-speed winds (<3 m/s) and, thus, led to the highest concentrations (>8 \u00b5g/m 3 ) in the presence of atmospheric inversion conditions.

The zone, including the SE region of Iraq and Kuwait and the NE section of the Arabian Gulf, commonly passed over by the corresponding air masses, has a significant potential to contribute to the elevated eBC concentrations measured at the monitoring site.

Cluster 2, representing slow-moving and low-altitude (850 m AGL) air masses, was more effectively polluted by the industrial and urban emissions along the pathway through the United Arab Emirates, Buqayq, and Al Hofuf cities of the KSA, and eventually arrived at the study area from the SSW section.",

The CWT analysis results of the entire study, Pre-LD, LD, and Post-LD periods are visualized in Figure 7 , where the weighted concentration (WCWT, \u00b5g/m 3 ) calculated for each cell (0.5 \u2022 \u00d7 0.5 \u2022 ) demonstrates the contribution level of a potential source location at the receptor site. During the entire study period, long-range source locations with WCWT values > 1 \u03bcg/m 3 , including the central and southeastern section of Iraq, Iran's western border with Iraq, Kuwait, distributed zones in the Arabian Gulf, and the United Arab Emirates, were associated with moderate to high eBC concentrations observed at the receptor site (Figure 7a ). The impacts of long-range source zones mentioned herein were also recently reported for the BC levels over Riyadh and Dammam's rainwater chemical compositions [52, 83] . In addition, it is evident from Figure 7a that the effects of regional source locations, such as the Arabian Gulf coastline of the KSA, Bahrain, and Qatar, with moderate to high WCWT values on the observed eBC levels were substantial. These medium-and long-range potential source zones were, thus, coherent with the idea that the advections of emissions from fossil fuel combustion at factories and power plants, gas flaring at oil refineries, transportation activities at densely populated urban cores, and heavy maritime traffic of oil tankers and cargo ships on the Arabian Gulf contributed to the BC budget over Dammam's atmosphere.",

The mean BC concentration measured in Dammam was higher than those in Bhubaneswar/India and Massachusetts/USA, most likely due to more extensive industrial and transportation activities in the study area. The BC levels indicated decreasing trends with varying rates for all compared sites in line with COVID-19 LD measures. The potential effect of LD countermeasures on BC emissions was more pronounced in Milan/Italy, where the highest decrease ratio of 71% was noticed. The mean BC reduction rate observed in Dammam is one of the lowest among others. This result could be attributed to a wide range of emission sources with varying speeds, intrinsic atmospheric stability, specific arid climate conditions of the Dammam area, and long-range sources.

Continuous monitoring of hourly eBC concentrations was initiated at a university campus' premises between 8 January and 2 July 2020. The eBC ff and eBC bb fractions in total eBC concentrations were estimated as 84% and 16%, respectively, by using the aethalometer data during the entire study period. Hourly variations of eBC ff and eBC bb levels during Pre-LD, LD, and Post-LD periods indicated distinct bimodal distributions. Before the implementation of COVID-19 LD measures, the highest eBC concentrations within the significant and sharp morning peak (5:00-10:00 am), the lowest concentrations between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm, and the minor peak (2:00 pm and 7:00 pm) along with the gradual concentration build-up from 7:00 pm to 5:00 am were attributed to (i) intense vehicular activities during morning rush hours, (ii) enhanced atmospheric instability around midday, and (iii) emissions from HDDTs under stable nocturnal atmospheric conditions, respectively. The mean eBC bb , eBC ff , and eBC t concentrations during the LD decreased by 14%, 24%, and 23%, respectively. The reductions in eBC levels within the LD period could be possibly attributed to the strict restrictions on public movement and activities for preventing the spread of COVID-19, further adding to changes in atmospheric conditions and effects of long-range transport. The results of the bivariate correlation analysis and polar plots of concentrations revealed obvious influences of local fossil fuel burning emissions and atmospheric conditions on the observed eBC levels. Besides, distinct regional and long-range source regions contributing to the measured concentrations at the receptor site were identified for the Pre-LD, LD, and Post-LD periods by using a cluster analysis of backward air mass trajectories and CWT analysis. Long-range potential source locations, including Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, distributed zones in the Arabian Gulf, and the United Arab Emirates, and regional source areas, such as the Arabian Gulf coastline of KSA, Bahrain, and Qatar, were associated with moderate to high concentrations observed at the receptor site. The nationwide COVID-19 LD has procured a unique chance for the atmospheric researchers, policymakers, and administrative bodies to assess the effects of emission reductions on the ambient air quality and to rethink the current and future air pollution mitigation strategies.",

The distributions of eBC bb hourly cycles were quite similar to those of eBC ff concentrations along the Pre-LD and LD periods. On the other hand, hourly variations of eBC bb concentrations within the Post-LD phase demonstrated a particular bimodal distribution with four sharp peaks at 3:00 am (0.50 \u00b1 0.34 \u00b5g/m 3 ), 7:00 am (0.44 \u00b1 0.27 \u00b5g/m 3 ), noon (0.39 \u00b1 0.32 \u00b5g/m 3 ), and 8:00 pm (0.52 \u00b1 0.27 \u00b5g/m 3 ). The highest eBC bb concentrations noticed within the sharp peak between 4:00 pm and 2:00 am might be due to emissions from biomass-burning stoves in restaurants and open-air barbecues under weak surface wind speeds and lower atmospheric boundary layer conditions.

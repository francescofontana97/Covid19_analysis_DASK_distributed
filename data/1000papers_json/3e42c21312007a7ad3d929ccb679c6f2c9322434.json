In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential associations of SMA with the susceptibility to and prognostication of COVID-19 need to be clarified. We documented an SMA case who contracted COVID-19 but only developed mild-to-moderate clinical and radiological manifestations of pneumonia, which were relieved by a combined antiviral and supportive treatment. We then reviewed a cohort of patients with SMA who had been living in the Hubei province since November 2019, among which the only 1 out of 56 was diagnosed with COVID-19 (1.79%, 1/56). Bioinformatic analysis was carried out to delineate the potential genetic crosstalk between SMN1 (mutation of which leads to SMA) and COVID-19/lung injury-associated pathways. Protein-protein interaction analysis by STRING suggested that loss-of-function of SMN1 might modulate COVID-19 pathogenesis through CFTR, CXCL8, TNF and ACE. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis also revealed a link between SMN1 and ACE2, despite low-confidence protein-protein interactions as suggested by STRING. This bioinformatic analysis could give hint on why SMA might not necessarily lead to poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.",

As of 31 July 2020, over 17.2 million individuals globally have been diagnosed with COVID-19, causing more than 673 000 deaths [3] . Most patients with COVID-19 showed mild symptoms, including myalgia, cough, fatigue and fever, and had a good prognosis. However, about 10-20% of patients with COVID-19 could quickly progress to the severe disease, especially among elder people with underlying comorbidities [2] . ACE2 is known to directly mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and thus assumes a key function in COVID-19 pathogenesis. The renin-angiotensinaldosterone (RAAS) axis, in which both ACE and ACE2 are involved, also plays a potential role in mediating other aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis. For instance, reduced degradation of bradykinin as a result of downregulated ACE activity might contribute to the frequent occurrence of pulmonary edema and cough in COVID-19 patients [4] .",

It is linked to lossof-function mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene [5] , which encodes the SMN protein that is involved in ribonucleoprotein assembly, cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular trafficking of molecules (e.g. RNA granules) or organelles (e.g. synaptic vesicle and mitochondria). Given its multifaceted function, deficiency in SMN protein has been shown to promote a repertoire of cellular defects, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired bioenergetic pathways [6] . To date, only two agents-nusinersen (an antisense oligonucleotide modulating the alternative splicing of SMN2 gene which functionally replaces SMN1) and onasemnogene abeparvovecxioi (a prescription gene therapy delivering a SMN1 transgene) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of SMA [5] . However, both agents are very costly, placing them among the most expensive drugs in the world. Most cases with SMA are living with substantial comorbidities, especially those with respiratory compromise and on daily supportive care [5] .",

Intriguingly, these individuals also showed significantly lower ACE2 expression across human tissues (Figure 2A) . By lowering the minimum required interaction score of STRING from 0.4 to 0.15 and expanding the gene list to include SMN1and ACE2-strongly interacting genes, we were able to discern weak interactions between the SMN1-and ACE2-interacting gene networks ( Figure 2B ).",

            "text": "The current outbreak of COVID-19, which was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020, is a global health concern. Recent studies suggested that the male gender, older age, lower count of lymphocyte and underlying diseases (such as chronic respiratory disease) were associated with poor prognosis in COVID- 19 [12] . Patients of SMA are susceptible to respiratory infections and might be at a heightened risk of severe disease manifestations upon contracting COVID-2019. Since ACE2 is a key receptor mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells whereas downregulated ACE activity might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 [4] , it is therefore important to delineate the potential functional and signaling interactions between SMN1 (the causative gene of SMA) and ACE/ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 shared many similarities to SARS-CoV, in which phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed that both SAR-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the betacoronavirus genus lineage B 14 . Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 (angiotensin I converting enzyme 2) receptor via N-terminal S1 subunit, which was cleaved with the host TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2) to expose the subunit of C-terminal S2 that induces cellvirus fusion [14] . The receptor of ACE2 was found to be expressed not only in alveolar type-2 cells at high levels but also in myocardial cells, liver cholangiocytes, kidney proximal tubules, esophagus keratinocytes, gastrointestinal epithelial cells and bladder urothelial cells [15] . In this connection, ACE2-dependent viral entry into host cells is an important pathogenic step [16] . It has also been shown that injecting SARS-CoV spike protein into mice could suppress ACE2 expression and worsen lung injury [17] . These data suggested that ACE2 acted both as the SARS-CoV entry receptor and defend against the lung injury. In this connection, our eQTL analysis showed that SMN1 deficiency might increase the level of ACE2. As ACE2 suppression by SARS-CoV-2 could take part in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, patients with higher basal ACE2 expression are supposed to be less susceptible to develop severe disease. Concordantly, we observed that males, which are known to be prone to develop more severe disease upon contracting COVID- 19 [12] , have a lower basal expression of ACE2 across tissue types (Figure 3) . Aside from ACE2, it has been hypothesized that angiotensin II produced by ACE might mediate other aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis, including vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, lung damage and edema [4] . It is, therefore, likely that SMN1 could functionally interact with both ACE and ACE2 to exert its potential diseasemodifying effect on COVID-19. SMA is caused by SMN protein deficiency, leading to the degeneration and death of spinal cord anterior horn cells and characterized by symmetric atrophy and proximal muscle weakness of lower limbs [5] . SMA also negatively impacts many other organ systems. SMA1 is the causative gene of SMA, of which about 95% of SMA patients carried homozygous deletion, causing ablation of SMN1 expression or its conversion to SMN2 [5] . Only 5% of patients with SMA harbored compound heterozygous variants in SMN1. A previous study showed that SMN acts as an inhibitor of IL-1\u03b2-induced NF-\u03baB signaling through regulating I\u03baB kinase and TRAF6 [18] . Until now, there is no study reporting on how SMN1 deficiency might affect COVID-19 occurrence and prognosis. Herein, we defined the biological interactions between SMN1 and ACE/ACE2 through an integrated bioinformatic analysis, which would shed new light on how SMA pathophysiologically interacts with COVID-19. In this regard, CXCL8, TNF and CFTR might act as key mediators. In fact, previous laboratory investigations have shown that TNF could suppress ACE expression whereas ACE gene polymorphism could modulate the severity of cystic fibrosis (caused by CFTR mutation) [19, 20] .",

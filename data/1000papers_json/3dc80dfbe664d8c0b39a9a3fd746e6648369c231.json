The current neurologic COVID-19 literature consists primarily of retrospective studies that often conflate non-specific symptoms (e.g., agitation, executive dysfunction, myalgias, dizziness, and headache) with neurologic diagnoses (e.g., stroke, seizures, and Guillain-Barre syndrome), leading to wide variability in neurologic event prevalence estimates (4-84% across studies) (1-3). While initial reports speculated on the neuro-invasiveness of SARS-CoV-2, no convincing pathologic data exist to support neurotropism (4) . Conversely, case reports of Guillain-Barre syndrome and acute disseminated encephalitis suggested post-infectious, autoimmune-mediated neurological injury. Furthermore, an emerging literature describing a post-viral syndrome characterized by fatigue, cognitive problems, and neuropsychiatric disorders points to a potential second wave of subacute COVID-19-related neurological conditions (5) . It remains unclear whether neurologic disorders in the context of COVID-19 represent a causal relationship, secondary effects of severe systemic illness, or mere coincidence.",

However, most such resources were established hurriedly with little to no funding or staff and often missed the peak of the pandemic in their regions. Furthermore, data on symptoms, tests, treatments, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 exist in the idiosyncratic electronic health records (EHRs) of individual hospitals and clinics. Collectively, this information has the potential to accelerate research, enable learning about the prevalence and consequences of COVID-19 complications, and facilitate the development of prevention and treatment strategies. But its current fragmentary state hampers scientific progress. An urgent challenge is to assemble, harmonize, and curate these diverse resources and make them widely available to researchers.",

Building upon standardized NIH/NINDS common data elements (CDEs), we created additional variables to capture COVID-19-specific medical complications as well as new or worsened neurological disorders. The harmonization of variable definitions, capturing aspects of infection, disease course, treatment, outcomes, and complications, will enable analyses that define the scope of the problem, indicate associations that may be important for treatment and management, and present further avenues for examination. To assess causality, we adapted previously published association criteria developed for COVID-19 related meningitis, encephalitis, central nervous system vasculitis, and myelitis (3). We included additional variables to establish the timing from COVID-19 diagnosis or initial symptom onset. For ease of use and generalizability, we will use the World Health Organization Clinical (WHO) Progression Score to determine COVID-19-related severity of illness and the modified Rankin Score (in adults) and the Pediatric Functional Status Scale (in neonates and children) to assess neurological function at the time of hospital discharge or outpatient presentation. Other hospital metrics include the NIH stroke score, Glasgow Coma score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (PELOD-2), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM or CAM-ICU), length of stay, intensive care unit requirement, ventilator days, and discharge disposition. All of these instruments are among the most commonly documented scoring systems utilized by health systems across the U.S.",

All data and samples will be stripped of personal identifiers and linked only to a Global Unique Identifier (GUID); this process enforces retention of personal protected health information only at the originating site (one-way encryption), and enables linking of patient data from multiple sources, and between pregnant mothers and their newborn infants. Dates and other potentially identifying elements are converted into a series of hash-codes using a specialized algorithm to ensure non-identifiability and the inability to link back to individuals following submission of data. This robust process of de-identification will ensure the creation of fully anonymized datasets that can then be widely, and securely, shared with researchers, in full accordance with NIH data sharing policies and goals.",

Foremost is the ability to incorporate data from a truly diverse population of patients, including underrepresented, vulnerable populations, whether they be defined by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or social and/or physical marginalization (e.g., rural, homeless, or justicesystem-involved populations). While we cannot guarantee the representativeness of the data collected, a strong effort will be made to enroll a diverse patient population and encourage participation by a variety of institutions and practitioners. A second advantage is the ability, by casting a wide net across the nation and potentially the globe, to uncover and document rare effects that are impossible to detect with less far-ranging or more focused sampling. This effort in data collection will enable a rich characterization of the emerging neurological effects of COVID-19, and just as importantly, of the impact of the infection on existing or latent neurologic illnesses.",

Fracture neck of femur (NOF) patients is high-risk surgical patients, often with multiple comorbidities and advanced age. We quantify the 30-day mortality rate in fractured NOF patients with a positive peri-operative COVID-19 antigen test and identify risk factors for increased mortality. Methods This is a retrospective multi-centre review of all patients admitted with a fractured NOF and a confirmed laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 between 1 March and 26 April 2020. Demographic data, comorbidities, ASA grade and date of death (if applicable) were collected. Results There were 64 patients in the cohort with an overall 30-day mortality rate of 32.8% (n = 21). Thirty-five (55%) were female, and mean age was 83 (SD 9, range 46-100) years. There was significantly increased mortality for those with a history of myocardial infarction (p = 0.03). Sixty-four percent of patients underwent surgery within the 36-h target, which is comparable to previous data for the same time of year. Overall mortality increased to 50% (n = 32) at 45 days post-operatively. Conclusion This is a large review of 30-day mortality in NOF patients with concurrent COVID-19 infection. We report a substantial increase from the pre-COVID-19 mean 30-day mortality rate (6.5% in 2019). We highlight the need for counselling patients when presenting with a NOF in relation to peri-operative COVID-19 infection and the associated increased risks.",

To our knowledge, this pattern of increased mortality to 45 days has not previously been recognised, and we postulate COVID-19 infection as the cause for this in our patient demographic. Mortality rates in 2017 at 1 year were 33% which are already surpassed in our COVID positive patient group at 45 days.

Therefore, it is possible that some patients will have been inadvertently excluded from the study if they had a false-negative test. We only assessed COVID-19 positive patients and used previous years' data to compare mortality rates. We accept that this is a limitation of the study, and COVID-19 negative neck of femur patients presenting at the same time would be the most appropriate control group. However, we argue that because of false-negatives, and asymptomatic patients not being tested at the time of this study across all trauma units, this comparison could be compromised. There is the potential that overall care could have been negatively affected during the pandemic. Services could have been reduced, due to staff sickness, for example orthogeriatric or physiotherapy. Fewer anaesthetic and surgical team members may have been available to conduct surgery, although this has not been our experience. Time to theatre in our cohort of patient remains similar to previous years, an indicator of adequate theatre capacity. By comparing to previous year's data, we eliminate these other potential variables, whilst accepting that this is a weakness of the methodology of this paper.",

This is a substantial increase in mortality from the national data prior to the pandemic (6.5%). It is important that clinicians are aware of this high mortality rate when counselling patients and relatives of those admitted with hip fractures. Further work is required to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 infection on mortality in other areas of surgical practice, including elective operating.",

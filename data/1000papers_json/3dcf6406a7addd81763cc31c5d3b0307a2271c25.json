In the ScienceDirect repository, China has contributed by the largest number of publications, followed by United States, Italy and United Kingdom (Figure 1) . To some extent, this trend of proliferation of scientific documents reciprocates with magnitude of disease burden and associated morbidity and mortality in these countries. Further, breakdown of publications in medical disciplines in the Web of Science database has shown a highest number of documents published in the Journal of Internal Medicine, followed by surgery, imaging and infectious disease journals (Figure 3) . This includes all categories of articles such as editorial, review, original research, opinions, short communications, letters to editors and commentaries. This data reflects enormous response by the medical fraternity to COVID-19 pandemic by conceiving, conducting and publishing novel research findings in a wealth of publishing titles. Regrettably, despite this profound work, so far we have neither succeeded in drawing a unified contingency management protocol nor a vaccine for combating COVID-19 disease.",

These droplets are primarily composed of a complex cloud that embraces air, cluster of droplets and pathogens. Due to the forward thrust of the cloud, the virus-containing droplets are propelled much farther than if they were thrown without a heavy cloud. This biophysics of gas clouds and gas cloud dynamics bears significant implications in disease progression and provides the basis for a 2-meter social distancing and home-isolation. Though researchers have reported growth of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from blood and feces of COVID-19 patients (2, 3), Coccolini et al. have confirmed its presence in the peritoneal cavity of a 78-year-old man [12] . Using the real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the investigators have detected the genome of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the peritoneal fluid. This finding has significant implications for the abdominal surgeons and gastroenterologists as they invariably deal with GIT fluids and secretions during their clinical practices.",

From a global perspective, the federal governments and health-care authorities have modified the protocols and guidelines for general and specialty surgical practices [13] . Elective surgery for benign disorders are deferred till COVID-19 pandemic is abated. This is mostly driven by the fact that laparoscopic surgery for benign and non-urgent illnesses may potentially lead to unwanted complications with poor surgical outcomes [14] . Healthcare professionals (HCPs) should inform the patients and their families about medical reasons for postponing surgery, particularly the collective community welfare of reserving hospital beds for critically ill patients with respiratory disorders. On the other hand, oncological surgery would continue during the COVID-19 crisis by adhering to the general principles of surgical practice [15] [16] .

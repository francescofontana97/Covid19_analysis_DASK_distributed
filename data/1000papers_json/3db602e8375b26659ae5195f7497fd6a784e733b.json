Earlier results from APOGEE pointed to a large contribution of destroyed GCs to the stellar content of the inner halo, by as much as 25%, which is an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates for more distant regions of the halo. We set out to measure the ratio between N-rich and normal halo field stars, as a function of distance, by performing density modelling of halo field populations in APOGEE DR16. Our results show that at 1.5 kpc from the Galactic Centre, N-rich stars contribute a much higher 16 +12 \u22127 % fraction to the total stellar halo mass budget than the 2 +1 \u22120.7 % ratio contributed at 15 kpc. Under the assumption that N-rich stars are former GC members that now reside in the stellar halo field, and assuming the ratio between first-and second-population GC stars being 1-to-2, we estimate a total contribution from disrupted GC stars of the order of 24.7 +16 \u221210 % at r = 1.5 kpc and 3 +1.5", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "\u22121 % at r = 15 kpc.

A milestone in this field was the work by Searle & Zinn (1978) , who used the Galactic GC population to infer that GCs found in the outer Galactic halo region formed over a longer period than those found in the inner-halo region, leading to the conclusion that the former population originated from accreted satellite systems. This concept has since been refined with improved measurements of ages and chemical abundances, leading to the discovery of a bifurcation in the age-metallicity distribution of Galactic GCs (Mar\u00edn-Franch et al. 2009 ), where the young and metal-poor branch traces the population of GCs that are thought to result from satellite galaxy accretion (e.g., Forbes & Bridges 2010; Leaman et al. 2013) . Similarly, this division is also reflected in the \u03b1 and Fe compositions of GCs with metallicities between -1.5 < [Fe/H] < -1, whereby accreted GCs typically present lower [\u03b1/Fe] for a given [Fe/H] in comparison to their in situ counterparts (e.g., Horta et al. 2020b ). The results obtained from these observational studies fit well in the present cosmological framework, the \u039b-CDM model (e.g., Schaeffer & Silk 1985; Frenk & White 2012) . In this cosmological paradigm, larger galaxies engulf smaller satellite galaxies and grow through a process of hierarchical mass assembly. As a result, a substantial fraction of the GCs from those accreted galaxies should survive during the accretion event and remain within the outer regions of the Galactic halo, as found by many observational results (e.g., Ashman & Zepf 1992; Brodie & Strader 2006; Myeong et al. 2019; Massari et al. 2019; Koppelman et al. 2019; Kruijssen et al. 2019b; Forbes 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 218, "text": "Searle & Zinn (1978)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 673, "end": 698, "text": "(Mar\u00edn-Franch et al. 2009", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 835, "end": 857, "text": "Forbes & Bridges 2010;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 858, "end": 877, "text": "Leaman et al. 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1076, "text": "[Fe/H]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1146, "text": "Horta et al. 2020b", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1297, "text": "Schaeffer & Silk 1985;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1317, "text": "Frenk & White 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1700, "text": "Ashman & Zepf 1992;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1701, "end": 1723, "text": "Brodie & Strader 2006;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1743, "text": "Myeong et al. 2019;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1744, "end": 1764, "text": "Massari et al. 2019;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1787, "text": "Koppelman et al. 2019;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1788, "end": 1811, "text": "Kruijssen et al. 2019b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1824, "text": "Forbes 2020)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "To elucidate the role GCs play in the formation and mass assembly of their host galaxies, it is vital to first understand how GCs form and evolve in a cosmological context.

In an attempt to answer such a question, over the last decade there has been substantial work focusing on the identification of GC stars that have been stripped from their parent GC, and now reside in the halo field of the Galaxy (e.g., Martell & Grebel 2010; Martell et al. 2016; Schiavon et al. 2017; Koch et al. 2019; Hanke et al. 2020, Kisku et al., in prep) . In these studies, stars arising from GC dissolution and/or evaporation were identified either by selecting field stars that present high nitrogen and low carbon abundances, or by identifying stars with strong CN bands, a feature that implies a higher N content and one that is typically found in the so called \"second population\" (SP) GC stars (for a full review, see Bastian & Lardo 2018) . Such studies have focused on both the outer regions of the stellar halo (Martell & Grebel 2010; Martell et al. 2016; Koch et al. 2019) , and within the inner few kiloparsecs from the Galactic Centre (Schiavon et al. 2017; Fern\u00e1ndez-Trincado et al. 2019) . Specifically, Martell et al. (2016) focused on metal poor ([Fe/H] \u2264 -1.3) sample from the twelfth APOGEE data release and identified halo field stars that present high [N/Fe] and [Al/Fe] values, indicating high N and Al abundances, thus selecting SP GC escapee candidates. Using the number ratio of N-rich stars to halo field stars, Martell et al. (2016) obtained an estimate for the contribution from dissolved SP GC stars to the outer regions of the stellar halo to be on the order of 2-3%. This estimate was also obtained in a more recent study by Koch et al. (2019) , which found a similar value of\u223c2.6%. Separately, Schiavon et al. (2017) analysed APOGEE data for stellar populations within \u223c3 kpc of the Galactic Centre and found a much larger fraction of N-rich stars than their outer halo counterpart. In their study, Schiavon et al. (2017) identified field stars that presented high [N/Fe] and low [C/Fe] compared to the main population at a given metallicity, and determined a minimum contribution to the stellar halo from dissolved and/or evaporated SP GC stars of approximately\u223c13-17%.

Answering these questions is non-trivial due to the difficulty in correcting the observed number of a tracer population to the total underlying sample. Along the same lines, estimates of the stellar mass are rigidly connected to the derived mass normalisation per tracer star, which generally relies on intricate calibration and stellar models. Moreover, GCs are typically associated to the stellar halo component of the Galaxy, and with no previous knowledge of the density profile of GC escapees, it is important to first understand how the stellar halo is spatially distributed. This information can be used as a guide to understand the density profile of GC-escapee stars, and will serve later for assessing the contribution of N-rich stars to the stellar halo field.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Recently, Iorio et al. (2018) modelled the density of the stellar halo using a cross-matched sample of Gaia-2MASS RR Lyrae stars. In that work, several density profiles ranging in parameter complexity were tested, and it was found that the stellar halo was best fit by a triaxial ellipsoid, rotated with respect to the Galactic reference frame (in which the X axis connects the Sun to the Galactic Centre) by \u223c 70 \u2022 ; such rotation was thought to be introduced by a sin-gle massive merger event. Using Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars from the APOGEE fourteenth data release Mackereth & Bovy (2020) also found this to be the case. However, the same study estimated a total halo stellar mass on the order of \u223c1.3 \u00d7 10 9 M when considering the halo as an assembly of many individual components in the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. This result is in agreement with the recent work of Deason et al. (2019) , based on RGB number counts and extrapolation of the Einasto (1965) profile, which also suggests a higher mass for the stellar halo of \u223c1.4 \u00d7 10 9 M . These works utilised existing density models to understand the shape and density profile of the stellar halo component of the Galaxy. Using such density modelling procedures, they were able to estimate the total mass of the stellar halo within a given Galactocentric radius.

Besides an estimate of the contribution to the stellar-halo budget by stars that once belonged to GCs, another output from our method is the spatial distribution of those stars. In this section, we estimate the mass density contributed from the halo and N-rich samples respectively as given by our best fitting density models as a function of distance from the Galactic Centre. Then we estimate the ratio between the mass in N-rich stars and the total stellar-halo mass. To determine the total mass contributed by field stars from GC origin to the stellar halo, we assume the ratio of \"first population\" (FP) to \"second population\" (SP) stars in GC to be 2 SP stars for every 1 FP star, adopting the minimal scenario proposed by Schiavon et al. (2017) . Although other FP-to-SP GC star ratios have been proposed (e.g. Bastian & Lardo 2015; Cabrera-Ziri et al. 2015) , we chose to focus solely on the \"minimal scenario\" as it has been shown by Schiavon et al. (2017) that other scenarios can be excluded due to the predicted total GC star number counts exceed-ing the expected number of total halo stars. We then take the ratio of the disrupted GC mass with halo mass, to assess the mass contribution of the former to the halo field as a function of Galactocentric distance. Performing this exercise will not only lead to a deeper understanding of the origin of disrupted GC stars (and in consequence N-rich stars), but it will also provide a more clear understanding of the mass contribution from GC destruction to the total stellar halo mass budget. We determine the mass in spherical annuli for both Nrich and halo stars, which in turn enables us to determine the mass from each sample as a function of spherical radius, as well as the ratio between the samples. As mentioned above, to estimate the mass contribution by stars that once belonged to GCs, we need to account for the contribution by former GC stars whose abundance patterns do not differ from that of the field population at same metallicity, which can be accounted for by assuming the FP-SP GC star ratio predicted from the minimal scenario. Now that we have determined the density of both Nrich and halo stars as a function of Galactocentric distance, we focus our attention on estimating the ratio between Nrich stars and the total stellar halo.

Moreover, around the solar neighbourhood (i.e., r = 8 kpc), we find the ratio to be \u03b6 = 3.2 +1.1 \u22120.9 %.

A recent study found that the APOGEE DR14 giant data were best fit by a similar single power-law profile, however with the inclusion of a disc and cut-off term (Mackereth & Bovy 2020) , such as the model employed to fit the halo sample in this study. The power law slope obtained for this model was found to be steep \u03b1\u223c3.5, presenting a flattened triaxial ellipsoid, p\u223c0.73 and q\u223c0.56, slightly rotated in the Z and Y axes. The behaviour resulting from the fit to the APOGEE data is similar to work from the literature. Fitting a likely halo sample of stars with metallicities between -2.5 < [Fe/H] < -1, we find the data are well matched by a triaxial profile with a moderately steep exponent \u03b1\u223c3.5, flattened with p\u223c0.8 and q\u223c0.5. We also find the triaxial ellipsoid to be minorly rotated to the Z and Y axes, by \u03b8\u223c3-4 degrees and \u03c6\u223c14 degrees, respectively.

We have shown that N-rich stars contribute a \u03b6 = 16 +12 \u22127 % to the halo field at\u223c1.5 kpc from the Galactic Centre (see Fig 8) , resulting in a much larger contribution when compared to the outer regions of the Galaxy (i.e. r\u223c15 kpc) for which we find a ratio of \u03b6 = 2 +1 \u22120.7 %.

In this subsection, we discuss the results from previous studies which have shown, using measurements other than chemical compositions, that N-rich stars are likely formed from the dissolution and/or evaporation of GCs. The availability of the 6D phase space information provided by the Gaia survey has made possible the estimation of the integrals of motion (hereafter IoM) of stars in the Milky Way. Such properties are adiabatic invariants, and thus retain some information about the origin of their parent population. A recent study by Savino & Posti (2019) determined the IoM for a sample of 65 CN-strong stars, from the work by Martell & Grebel (2010) , as well as for the Galactic GC system. In their study, a direct comparison of the IoM values, as well as the metallcity values, was performed for every N-rich-GC pair, associating a likelihood of these being from the same distribution.

Our methodology consists on fitting several different stellar halo density models and determining their logarithmic maximum likelihood (ln(L max )) and Bayesian Inference Criterion (BIC, Schwarz 1978) values (see Section 3.3). We then compare the values obtained for each density model, and take the profile with the lowest BIC value to be our best fit model. If two models obtain the same ln(L max ) value, the BIC value gives preference to the model with the lowest number of free ranging parameters, therefore choosing the simplest model.As described in Section 3.2, our N-rich sample is fit by a spherical single power law (SPL), an axisymmetric single power law (AXI), a triaxial power law (TRI), a rotated triaxial power law with the inclusion of a cut-off term and a disc contamination parameter (TRI-CUT-DISC), a broken power law (BPL), and an exponential disc profile (DISC). The resulting BIC and ln(L max ) values obtained using the median posterior parameter of the 10,000 MCMC realisations for each model are listed in Table 1 . From our results, we find that the best fit model to our N-rich sample is the AXI model, and therefore choose to use this model for the remainder of the analysis. However, as is apparent from Fig A1, the TRI and TRI-CUT-DISC density profiles also provide good fits to the N-rich star data. Moreover, we repeat the methodology for determining the percentage ratio contribution of N-rich stars to the halo field employed in the main body of the paper using the TRI and TRI-CUT-DISC profile as the best-fitting N-rich models, in order to check if our results vary when adopting a different model for the N-rich star sample. The results from this comparison show that our initial findings remain unchanged, and suggest that the N-rich star sample can either be well modelled by the AXI, TRI, and TRI-CUT-DISC profiles.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 255, "end": 274, "text": "(BIC, Schwarz 1978)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1106, "end": 1113, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1315, "text": "Fig A1,", "ref_id": null}], "section": "APPENDIX A: FITTING THE N-RICH STAR SAMPLE"}]}

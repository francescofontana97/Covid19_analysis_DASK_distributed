Cardiac complications secondary to this infection are common and associated with mortality. This study aimed to evaluate whether subclinical myocardial dysfunction exists in non-hospitalized mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients using left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS). In this cross-sectional, single-center study, data were collected from non-hospitalized mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients between January 01 and February 01, 2021. Fifty (26 male, 24 female) COVID-19 patients and 50 age-and sex-matched healthy volunteers were included in the study. Apical four-, three-, and two-chamber images were analyzed longitudinally by conventional methods and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) for left ventricle functions. The mean age of the COVID-19 patients was 39.5 \u00b1 8.96, and 52% of them were male. The most prevalent presenting symptoms were fever [in 34 (68%)], asthenia [in 30 (60%)], loss of appetite [in 21 (42%)], myalgia [in 20 (40%)], and cough [in 13 (26%)]. Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 patients than in the controls (10.84 \u00b1 12.44 vs. 4.50 \u00b1 2.81, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of standard echocardiography and Doppler parameters (p > 0.05). Left ventricular longitudinal strain and strain velocity parameters were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals. LV-GLS values (\u2212 21.72 \u00b1 3.85% vs. \u2212 23.11 \u00b1 4.16%; p = 0.003) were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients compared with the healthy controls. Mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients also have subclinical myocardial dysfunction similar to hospitalized patients. STE has the potential for detecting subclinical LV systolic dysfunction, and can provide useful information regarding cardiac status in mildly symptomatic COVID-19 population.",

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from an asymptomatic form to severe acute respiratory syndrome and even death [2, 3] . The proportion of patients who remained asymptomatic throughout the infection was approximately 20% of all confirmed cases [4] . Approximately 80% of symptomatic patients have experienced a mild clinical course, defined as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade fever, or malaise [5] .

In a single-center study, 19% of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 experienced a cardiac injury, and these patients had worse clinical outcomes [10] . Moreover, long-term cardiac sequelae have been identified in patients who recently recovered from COVID-19, regardless of the severity and overall course of the acute illness [11] .

Standard echocardiographic images (parasternal long-axis, parasternal short-axis, apical-two chamber, apical three-chamber, and apical four-chamber views) were captured and evaluated by motion mode (M-mode), 2D, continuous stream Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) according to the American Echocardiography Association's criteria [16] . Left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD; mm), left ventricle end-systolic diameter (LVESD; mm), interventricular septum diameter (IVS; mm) at end-diastole, and posterior wall diameter (PW) at end-diastole were obtained from the M-mode echocardiographic tracing under the guide of 2D. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; %) was measured using the biplane modified Simpson method (diastolic volume \u2212 systolic volume)/ (diastolic volume) as recommended by current guidelines (17) . Diastolic functions were evaluated by measurement of transmitral flow parameters including the early (E) and late (A) diastolic filling velocities, the E/A ratio, deceleration time (DT), and isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) from an apical four-chamber view with the sample volume sited at the tip of the mitral leaflet. Tissue Doppler velocities were measured from the septal and lateral annulus in apical four-chamber view. The peak systolic (Sm), early diastolic (Em), and late diastolic velocity (Am) were also measured. The values were determined by averaging three subsequent beats.",

Aortic valve closure was identified at baseline and at each grade of procedure in the apical 3-chamber view. We determined the AVC time automatically with the help of the software at the end of the T wave. The accuracy of the timing was validated by identifying the AVC visually using the B-mode image, and before finalizing its electrocardiographic location, the necessary adjustments were done. We started measurement from the basal septum, manually placing 6 or 7 equally distributed endocardial points. Using these points, the 2D speckle tracking algorithm followed the endocardium as the region of interest (ROI) to determine the wall thickness along the heart cycle. ROI consisted of three concentric lines representing the endocardial and epicardial margins and the middle myocardial layer. The required settings were made to match the myocardial thickness, excluding the pericardium. The left ventricle, 4-chamber, 3-chamber, 2-chamber images were analyzed using STE. Furthermore, strain parameters of each segment were evaluated by employing the AFI protocol ( Fig. 1 ).",

In our study, we observed an impairment in longitudinal systolic strain despite normal systolic parameters measured by TDI and conventional echocardiography. The early manifestation of cardiac abnormalities is usually observed in the subendocardial layer since subendocardial fibers are more vulnerable to myocardial ischemia and inflammation [22, 23] . The CRP levels were also consistently higher in the COVID-19 patients than in healthy subjects. We speculate that subendocardial longitudinal fibers will be the first affected region before obvious cardiac manifestation due to ongoing inflammation. Therefore, the measurement of the LVGLS appears to be a reliable method in the early detection of subclinical cardiac dysfunction.",

            "text": "Left ventricular global longitudinal strain measured by STE is an objective and reproducible technique that measures myocardial deformation with angle independence. GLS is a more sensitive predictor of left ventricular dysfunction than LVEF and provides additional prognostic value to LVEF. It can also predict subclinical myocardial dysfunction before overt cardiovascular diseases, even in asymptomatic patients [24] . The diagnostic and prognostic role of STE has been demonstrated in different clinical settings such as LV hypertrophy, cardio-oncology, valvular diseases, and cardiomyopathies [25] . Lower LVGLS in large patient populations predicts future cardiac events regardless of LVEF, age, gender, and hypertension [26] . The presence of impaired longitudinal function in hospitalized COVID-19 patients has also been demonstrated previously [27] . Moreover, Janus et al. demonstrated that reduction in LVGLS is a powerful predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients [28] . As the long-term cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 infection are not known yet, patients with preserved LVEF and reduced LVGLS may benefit from close observation. Currently, myocardial injury due to COVID-19 is mainly defined by elevated serum troponin levels with a prevalence of 8-30% of affected patients [29, 30] . It is associated with fatal outcomes such as respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, life-threatening arrhythmias, and mortality [31] . However, autopsy-based studies reported that COVID-19 cases often have cardiac fibrin microthrombi without universal acute ischemic injury [32] . They have also suggested that myocardial inflammation could exist without myocyte damage [32] . In a recent MRI-based study, a high rate of subclinical myocardial involvement was reported in patients with COVID-19 infection [11] . The investigators suggested that most patients had myocardial inflammation, regardless of the severity and overall course of the acute disease. Our findings support that patients with mild symptomatic COVID-19 infection may have subclinical myocardial dysfunction. Elevated biomarkers in COVID-19 may only reflect the severity of the disease rather than cardiac involvement. We, therefore, believe that the diagnosis of cardiac involvement can be easily overlooked when the assessment is based on troponin screening alone.",

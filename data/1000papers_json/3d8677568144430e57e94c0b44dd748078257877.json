For prevention, South Korea has adopted a local quarantine strategy rather than a global lockdown. This approach not only minimizes economic damage, but it also efficiently prevents the spread of the disease. In this work, the spread of COVID-19 under local quarantine measures is modeled using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model on complex networks. In this network approach, the links connected to isolated people are disconnected and then reinstated when they are released. This link dynamics leads to time-dependent reproduction number. Numerical simulations are performed on networks with reaction rates estimated from empirical data. The temporal pattern of the cumulative number of confirmed cases is then reproduced. The results show that a large number of asymptomatic infected patients are detected as they are quarantined together with infected patients. Additionally, possible consequences of the breakdowns of local quarantine measures and social distancing are considered. arXiv:2010.07157v1 [physics.soc-ph] ",

Moreover, using the drive-through and walk-through methods, rapid and large-scale testing with safe separation between potential patients and medical staff has become possible. Individuals who enter the country from abroad or have been in close contact with confirmed patients are required undergo diagnostic tests. Those with positive results are required to be placed in quarantine for two weeks, which is the maximum incubation period of the disease. During the quarantine period, they must monitor their health daily and report it on a self-quarantine safety protection mobile application managed by the KCDC. Their locations are also monitored using the application. If they exit officially designated locations, they are immediately apprehended and fined. Thus, a near-ideal quarantine system is achieved.",

Every individual that the patient has been in contact with is identified and requested to take a diagnostic test. Those who were in close contact with the patient are preemptively quarantined, while others are encouraged to selfisolate at home. Among them, if some cases are confirmed, the infection route is identified. Thus, the locations at which the epidemic has originated are found, closed, and disinfected. Those who were in the same place but did not have close contact with the patient are identified or encouraged to voluntarily report to the KCDC, which allows them to take free diagnostic tests. In certain cases, the location identified may involve privacy infringement, such that individuals present at the same time as the patient may hesitate to report themselves having been there. Such individuals are identified using resources such as the mobile phone records in the local station and required to take a diagnostic test. Further, they are requested to self-quarantine. During the quarantine period, individuals are also expected to check their body temperature and report it on the application. After two weeks, they are encouraged to undergo the diagnostic test again. If the test result is negative, they are released and can return to their normal lives.",

It is worth examining the manner in which the epidemic contagion spreads under the K-quarantine model as compared to its spread under global lockdown without local restrictions. To achieve this, a mathematical model is considered in this work. The conventional epidemiological model is a compartmental model in which each person is considered to be in one of the following possible states: susceptible (S), latent (L), infected (I), or recovered/deceased (R). The proportions of people in each state are regarded as continuous variables, and their rate equations (time derivatives) are set up as a function of these proportions with appropriate rate constants. By solving these differential equations, the fraction of each state as a function of time is obtained. In the past, this approach has successfully predicted the evolution of the fraction of infected populations. However, it may not be useful when considering the local quarantine effect under the K-quarantine measures stated above.",

A network is composed of nodes and links, which represent people and contact between a pair of connected people, respectively. The numbers of nodes and links that are simulated on are taken as N = 2.1 \u00d7 10 4 and L = 5 \u00d7 N , respectively. This implies that a society composed of N people is being considered, and the average number of people in contact with each person (called the 'degree' in graph theory) is given as d = 2L/N = 10. Some of them, such as family members and colleagues in the workplace, are in close contact, whereas others, such as people who met at shopping malls, are in loose contact. However, these two groups were not differentiated in the simulations described herein. This is because distinguishing between these two types of contact is only necessary for lockdown measures [6] , where the loosely connected links are disconnected. In the K-quarantine model, such a lockdown is not applied. The links need not be distinguished into two types. Instead, all links are regarded as close contacts in this small simulation system sizes. The K-quarantine process is realized by locally disconnecting the links to an infected node. As soon as the quarantine is completed and the patient is released, these links are reinstated. In the K-quarantine model, once a person is quarantined, they are required to take a diagnostic test. If the result is positive, then the people in contact with the patient are quarantined. Thus, links connected to the neighbors of the confirmed patient also need to be disconnected.",

Because this model was first proposed by Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi, it is often called the ER model [9] . For scale-free networks, following the power law, the degrees of each node are heterogeneous. This implies that a few nodes have large degrees, but the remaining nodes have small ones. The nodes with large numbers of neighbors are called hubs. When a hub is infected, a large number of susceptible neighbors are exposed to the contagion. This may result in a spike in contagion. Scale-free networks were constructed using the models proposed by Goh et al. [10] and Chung and Lu [11] .",

This change is caused by a new type of coronavirus, GH clade [20, 21] . d, Similar plot to b, but the rate k6 = 0 at t = 108.

For f, N = 21403 and d = 7.8. Owing to this smaller mean degree, the contagion rate is lower. degree d = 10, k 1 = 0.11 is obtained when R 0 = 3.3 is taken. Using these parameter values, it is observed that the simulation result fits to the empirical data from an early stage (March 2020) of the Covid-19 outbreak in South Korea.

Initially, one node is assumed to be infected, while the other nodes are susceptible. The fractions \u03c1 S (t), \u03c1 R (t),\u03c1 C , and \u03c1 C , are obtained, where \u03c1 C = \u03c1 R * +\u03c1 I a +\u03c1 I s , and the dot represents the time derivative. \u03c1 C and \u03c1 C represent the proportions of newly confirmed cases and the accumulated confirmed cases, respectively. The three densities are shown in Fig. 2a . The contagion spreads rapidly during the early stage and eventually reaches a steady state. As shown in Fig 2b with k 6 = 0.09, when the quarantine system is functioning, the fraction \u03c1 C initially increases rapidly, then slowly increases with some fluctuations, and finally reaches a steady state. Resurgent behavior is observed in\u03c1 C . Further, it is noted that for the system with no quarantine strategy, the absorbing state of the infectious node completely disappears on reaching the 150th day, whereas for the K-quarantine system, it reaches the 400th day. The proportions of the accumulated confirmed cases for a and b are close; however, the proportion of remaining susceptible people is extremely small for a, but it is more than 20% for b. On the other hand, the fraction of asymptomatic infected patients appears to be about 30% for a, but it is approximately 10% for b. This is because asymptomatic patients can be detected when they are in quarantine owing to the infection of their neighbors. Fig. 2c depicts the case in which the infection rate k 1 suddenly increases to k 1 = 0.41 at t = 108, owing to the change of virus species from S or V to GH clade [20, 21] . There exists another significant peak of\u03c1 C around t = 130, and the infection rate increases dramatically. Following this, the system reaches a steady state. The density of \u03c1 C in the steady state increased by 22.72% compared to that of case b. However, no such dramatic change is observed in the empirical data. Fig. 2d depicts the case in which the quarantine system is overloaded and does not act at a certain time (e.g., t = 108). Then, \u03c1 C instantaneously exhibits resurgent behavior and \u03c1 C rapidly increases and reaches a steady state, as in the SIR model.",

            "text": "Next, the K-quarantine model is simulated on a scalefree network in Fig. 2e and on an empirical social network in Fig. 2f . It is thus concluded that overall, the contagion pattern is insensitive to network structure. However, the peaks of the daily confirmed case f is higher than those in Fig. 2b . For f, the mean degree is smaller than that for Fig. 2a-e . Therefore, the proportion of accumulated confirmed cases in the steady state is considerably smaller than that in Fig. 2b. For g-h, simulations are performed on modular networks [36, 37] . The modular networks are composed of N m modules, each of which contains N n nodes. Thus, the total number of nodes in the system is N m N n . Nodes within each module are connected to each other randomly with mean degree d intra = 10. To make the modules connected, m pairs of modules are selected randomly, each of the pairs are connected by p links by selecting p nodes from each module. Thus, the total number of inter-modular edges is L m = m p . Specific those numbers are listed in the caption of Fig. 2g -h. Fig. 3a and b depict the cases in which the system is lockdown for 60 days. The lockdown can be realized by either social distancing or restriction of transportation [6] [7] [8] . In a, the lockdown is implemented by deleting the fractions of links (indicated in the legend) randomly selected at the 30th day. After 60 days, those links are recovered. When the fractions are below 50%, the lockdown effect is almost negligible. On the other hand, when the fraction is 90%, then the epidemic spread is highly suppressed. In the intermediate range, a resurgent behavior appears. However, such behaviors fluctuate depending on the density of infectious nodes at the 30th day. Thus, in b, we consider the case that the starting day of lockdown measure is determined by the fraction of accumulated confirmed cases, called lockdown threshold. Once the lockdown comes into force, 70% of links are deleted and they are recovered after 60 days. Depending on the threshold value, the time of resurgent peak is determined. In short, while the lockdown measure during the 60 days is effective during some interval, the outbreak eventually occurs.",

The model proposed herein cannot reproduce the output of such a large perturbation.

It may be noted that social contact is not static but changes temporally. Thus, recognizing all individuals who were in contact with infectious individuals is a challenging task. Further, information on the spatial and temporal trajectories of infectious individuals is collected using diverse methods such as CCTV recordings, mobile phone data from local stations, and sending messages on mobile phones of ordinary people living in the given regions of the trajectories.

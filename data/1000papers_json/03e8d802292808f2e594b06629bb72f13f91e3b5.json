The RNA dependent RNA polymerase 24 (RdRp) among the viral proteins is known as an effective antiviral target. Lycorine is a 25 phenanthridine Amaryllidaceae alkaloid isolated from the bulbs of Lycoris radiata (L'H\u00e9r.) 26 Herb. and has various pharmacological bioactivities including antiviral function. simulation showed that lycorine interacts with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp at the Asp623, Asn691, 38 and Ser759 residues through hydrogen bonding, at which the binding affinities of lycorine 39 (\u22126.2 kcal/mol) were higher than those of remdesivir (\u22124.7 kcal/mol). 183 To examine the antiviral effect of lycorine (Fig. 1A) (Fig. 1B) . Our data showed 187 that IC 50 values were 2.123 \u00b1 0.053 \u03bcM (Fig. 1C) , and the CC 50 values were >50 \u03bcM. These showed that lycorine did not induce the cytotoxic effect up to 10 \u03bcM ( Fig. 2A) . Then, we 211 measured NLuc and FLuc activities following lycorine treatment using the MERS-RdRp 212 activity assay. Data showed that lycorine treatment reduced the relative NLuc activity in a 213 dose-dependent manner, and that FLuc activity was maintained up to 3.6 \u03bcM. These data Fig. 1) .",

Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic 60 has destroyed healthcare systems in various countries. As of August 2020, confirmed 61 COVID-19 cases have increased to almost 25 million, and global deaths are at around 616 62 thousand (Johns Hopkins University, 2020). To solve this pandemic, many efforts have been 63 made, and recently, the FDA authorized remdesivir as a potential COVID-19 treatment 64 during emergency situations (US Food and Drug Administration, 2020). Although remdesivir 65 is the first-class drug used for treating COVID-19, to date, clinical trials have shown 66 ambiguous results regarding its clinical benefits; moreover, it has unexpected adverse effects 67 (Grein et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 68 (CDC) of South Korea recognized that remdesivir cannot lower viral propagation in the early 69 phase of disease due to it is only used for hospitalized patients with severe disease. Therefore, 70 the development of novel drugs with high clinical efficacy and applicability to a broad range 71 of patient statuses is highly required. 72 Remdesivir acts as a potent inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in various 73 coronaviruses including mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 74 (Agostini et al., 2018; Gordon et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2020). Inhibition of RdRp activity to 75 prevent viral genome replication using nucleoside analog antivirals (NAAs) has been 76 regarded as a highly effective strategy for developing novel antivirals (De Clercq and Li, 77 2016). However, NAAs function by terminating chain elongation and mutation of viral 78 progeny, which may induce viral mutation that can cause drug resistance and genetic toxicity 79 7 to the host (Agostini et al., 2018; Jordheim et al., 2013). Therefore, discovery of non-80 nucleoside antivirals (NNAs) targeting viral polymerase against hepatitis C virus (HCV), 81 ZIKA, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections has also been extensively 82 studied (Ahmad et al., 2020; Costa et al., 2019; Watkins, 2019). 83 Lycorine is a bioactive phenanthridine alkaloid isolated from bulbs of Lycoris radiata 84 (L'H\u00e9r.) Herb. (family Amaryllidaceae). Lycorine is known for its anti-cancer, anti-85 inflammatory, antibacterial, antimalarial, enzyme inhibitory, and analgesic effects (Cao et al., 86 2013). Lycorine has also shown suppressive activity on in vitro viral replication of 87 flaviviruses such as Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, dengue-4, bunya, Punta Toro, Rift 88 Valley fever, herpes simplex 1, and poliomyelitis viruses (Gabrielsen et al., 1992; Hwang et 89 al., 2008; Renard-Nozaki et al., 1989). Moreover, lycorine was reported to inhibit diverse 90 coronavirus infections such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 91 both in vitro and in vivo (Li et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2019), and recent studies in cell culture 92 show lycorine's potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes the current 93 COVID-19 pandemic (Zhang et al., 2020); however, the mechanism of action of lycorine's 94 antiviral activity still needs to be elucidated. 95 In this study, we confirmed and compared the antiviral effect of lycorine on emerging CoVs 96 such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, and we elucidated lycorine's inhibitory 97 effect as a NNA on RdRp activity of the CoVs by using a recently established cell-based 98 reporter assay for MERS-CoV activity. Taken together, we report lycorine as a potent NNA 99 that acts against emerging CoV infections by targeting RdRp.",

The cell-196 based reporter system consisted of the MERS-CoV nsp12 plasmid and the bicistronic reporter 197 plasmid, p(+)FLuc-(\u2212)UTR-NLuc which contains the sense orientation firefly luciferase gene 198 (+)FLuc and the antisense orientation (\u2212)NLuc, which is flanked by the antisense orientation 199 3\u2032-and 5\u2032-UTR of MERS-CoV and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme self-cleavage 200 sequence. The full length of the bicistronic reporter plasmid is transcribed by the host DNA-201 dependent RNA polymerase, and the transcripts were then processed by HDV ribozyme self-202 cleavage. The exposed (-) strand of NLuc, flanked by the antisense 3\u2032-and 5\u2032-UTR RNA, can 203 13 be replicated by MERS-CoV RdRp. Then, the replicated (+) strand of NLuc RNA is 204 translated, and the expressed NLuc signal represents the activity of MERS-CoV RdRp. 205 Meanwhile, the expression level of FLuc is used as the internal control to normalize NLuc 206 activity. Since it was previously reported that lycorine inhibited the ZIKA virus by blocking 207 RdRp activity in the in vitro RNA polymerase assay (Chen et al., 2020), we examined the 208 effect of lycorine on MERS-CoV RdRp activity using the cell-based MERS-CoV RdRp 209 activity reporter assay.

Therefore, our data demonstrated that lycorine has potent anti-241 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection abilities comparable with that of remdesivir. 242 Moreover, we showed that the dose-dependent inhibition of human coronavirus OC43 spike 243 and nucleoprotein expression by lycorine using western blot analysis (Supplement Fig. 2).244 245 Lycorine can occupy the catalytic active site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein 246 We next examined possible mechanisms for lycorine-induced ectopic localization of the 247 SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein through in silico modeling. Remdesivir is a known selective 248 RdRp inhibitor and acts as a prodrug that is converted to the triphosphate form within cells, Siegel et al., 2017) afterwards, the metabolized monophosphate form of remdesivir inhibits 250 the RdRp protein by covalently linking to the primer strand of the viral RNA at the center of 251 the catalytic active site of SARS-CoV-2 (Yin et al., 2020). 252 Docking simulations showed that lycorine was properly located at the same binding sites as 253 remdesivir in the RdRp protein.

Lycorine was identified to possess an inhibitory ability on the SARS-CoV infection 268 (Li et al., 2005) and on four other CoV infections such as HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, HCoV-269 NL63, and MHV-A59 (Shen et al., 2019). Thus, we measured the inhibitory effect of lycorine 270 on MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection and found that lycorine efficiently 271 inhibited these CoVs with IC 50 values of 2.123\u00b10.053, 1.021\u00b10.025, and 0.878\u00b10.022 \u03bcM, 272respectively, which is comparable with the inhibitory effect of remdesivir in our conditions.273Our data suggested that lycorine may be more effective against SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 274 infections than in MERS-CoV infections, and that lycorine is more effective than remdesivir, 275 which is currently the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug.276 Lycorine was reported to suppress viral RNA replication and viral protein synthesis of 277 poliovirus (Hwang et al., 2008), EV71 virus (Liu et al., 2011) and avian influenza virus 278 H5N1 (Liu et al., 2011). Recently, it was suggested that lycorine could inhibit Zika virus viral 279 RNA synthesis and bind to the Zika RdRp protein (Chen et al., 2020). RdRp of RNA viruses 280 is known to be one of the most important viral proteins for viral RNA synthesis. Viral RdRp 281 has been suggested as a potential target for the development of anti-CoV therapeutics, as it 282 only exists in the virus and does not exist in the host cells; moreover, it is highly conserved in 283 the RNA virus, with 98% amino acid similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp 284 proteins (Shannon et al., 2020).285 Previously, we established a cell-based MERS-CoV RdRp activity assay system. It is 286 composed of the nsp12-expressing plasmid and the bicistronic MERS-CoV RdRp reporter 287 plasmid. This assay determined MERS-CoV RdRp activity based on the expression level of 288 NLuc (with FLuc expression as an internal control) in cells using this system. We measured 289 the effect of lycorine and remdesivir on the MERS-CoV RdRp activity and compared the 290 inhibitory activity of lycorine with that of remdesivir. Our data suggested that lycorine 291 inhibited the activity of MERS-CoV RdRp in a dose-dependent manner and that the IC 50 of 292 lycorine (1.406 \u00b1 0.260 \u03bcM) is lower compared with the IC 50 of remdesivir is (6.335 \u00b1 0.731 293 \u03bcM), indicating that lycorine has an efficient inhibitory ability on the activity of MERS-CoV 294 RdRp. Moreover, docking simulations showed that the binding affinity of lycorine to the 295 SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein is stronger than that of remdesivir (binding free energy change of 296 \u22126.2 for lycorine vs. \u22124.7 kcal/mol for remdesivir). The binding scores obtained from 297 lycorine and remdesivir were correlated with the IC 50 values of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our 298 system (0.878 \u00b1 0.022 \u03bcM for lycorine vs. 6.499 \u00b1 0.256 \u03bcM for remdesivir). Remdesivir is 299 known to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RdRp activity through non-obligate RNA chain termination 300 by targeting the center of the catalytic active site on the RdRp protein (Yin et al., 2020). 301 Lycorine has a similar binding position which overlaps with the nucleoside rings of 302 remdesivir in the same pocket region of the catalytic active site on the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp 303 protein. Lycorine was found to form hydrogen bonds with RdRp at Asp623, Asn691, and 304 Ser759 which is similar to remdesivir. We therefore suggest that those hydrogen bonds could 305 increase the binding affinity with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein. Finally, it results in an 306 inhibition of viral RdRp activity and interrupts viral replication during viral infection. Taken 307 together, we elucidated the inhibitory effect of lycorine on MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and 308 SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified lycorine as a direct inhibitor of RdRp through a cell-309 based reporter assay for MERS-CoV RdRp activity and a docking simulation with lycorine 310 and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein, suggesting that lycorine is more efficient as an inhibitor 311 compared with remdesivir. Therefore, our results suggest that lycorine could be a potential 312 broad spectrum anti-CoV drug as it can act as a MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-Dose-dependent inhibition of MERS-CoV infection by lycorine.

            "text": "As of October 12th, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic has affected more than 37 million people worldwide. Brazil is amongst the hardest hit countries, with more than 5 million confirmed cases and over 150,000 deaths (1) . Published studies of large cohorts show that, in critically ill patients, mortality has ranged from 39.5 to 54% (2) (3) (4) . Although evidence-based management of patients with severe COVID-19 in the intensive care unit is evolving rapidly (5, 6) , mortality remains high. Convalescent plasma (CP) is a potential therapeutic option for COVD-19. Preliminary reports of severe patients with suspected or confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suggested improvement in their viral load, laboratory markers of inflammation and organ dysfunction (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . A randomized trial of CP that enrolled patients with severe and life-threatening COVID-19 was conducted in Wuhan, China, but was stopped early due to slow enrollment after the containment of the epidemic (14) . Albeit the primary outcome of time to clinical improvement was not different between groups, the subgroup of patients requiring oxygen support without mechanical ventilation benefited from CP therapy. A subsequent randomized trial from India showed no benefit of CP in the combined outcomes of disease progression or all-cause mortality at 28 days in a cohort where the majority of patients had neutralizing antibodies prior to the treatment (15) . Thus, the data available do not support the use of CP for moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (16) . However, due to positive results in subgroups and limitations in published studies, whether CP is beneficial in specific populations of COVID-19 patients remains uncertain.",

A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed with a turnaround time of <12 h. All patients admitted to our ICU received usual standard of care (SOC) for severe COVID-19 (confirmed disease and need of oxygen support) and were included in a cohort study that recorded daily clinical and laboratory data in a dedicated case report form 1 . The Convalescent Plasma (CP) observational study protocol was approved on April 17th. For the purposes of the comparisons presented in this manuscript, patients in the SOC group were those admitted to our ICU between March 17th (first case admitted) and April 17th. Between April 18th and May 30th, all consecutive adult patients (age > 18 years) with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ICU or intubated for COVID-19-related respiratory failure for up to 3 days were considered eligible to receive CP therapy. Patients with negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and/or life expectancy <24 h, both in the SOC and CP groups, were excluded from the analysis (Supplementary eFigure 1). Eligible patients with confirmed COVID-19 and treated with CP between April 18th and May 30th were compared to patients that received only SOC treatment.

Hydrocortisone for refractory septic shock and methylprednisolone or dexamethasone for ARDS were used according to the decision of the attending physicians. Moreover, all patients received prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin (40 to 60 mg daily), unless contraindicated. Full therapeutic anticoagulation was reserved for patients with clinical evidence of thromboembolism. Patients under invasive ventilation, with and without ARDS, were managed with a protective ventilation strategy that included low tidal volume (6 mL/kg of predicted body weight) and driving pressure (<16 cmH2O) as well as optimal PEEP. Best PEEP was calculated based on the best lung compliance and PaO2/FiO2 ratio. In those with moderate to severe ARDS and PaO2/FiO2 ratio below 150, despite neuromuscular blockade and optimal ventilatory settings, prone position was initiated.",

This was not confirmed by a more recent publication, where patients with pneumonia and hypoxemia were randomized to receive CP or placebo, which showed no clinical improvement or reduced mortality in the treated group, as compared to controls (21) . In our study, we observed that invasive ventilation was avoided in all patients in the CP group without moderate-to-severe ARDS in our cohort (N = 7) and they survived to 28 days. In comparison, in the SOC group, 11 out of 28 without moderate-to-severe ARDS (39%) died within 28 days. Challenging this hypothesis that earlier administration of CP (before advanced pulmonary dysfunction) would more likely improve outcomes, an open label randomized trial including patients with early moderate disease showed no difference in the composite outcome of progression of pulmonary injury or death (15) . However, 86% of CP-treated patients in the trial had measurable neutralizing antibodies. Combined, these findings suggest that more data is needed on patients with early disease and absent antibody response to define the efficacy of CP for COVID-19.",

Among those that received 2 CP doses, 46% had negative PCR as late as 14 days after infusion. These differences may seem promising for higher doses of CP, but the fact that we did not measure sequential PCR in the SOC group limits the interpretation of these findings. In comparison to previous studies, CP-related factors were similar, including plasma volume administered and anti-S antibody concentrations (10, 13) . One potential explanation for the smaller rate of viral clearance in our patients is that they were treated earlier in the course of the disease. Median time from symptom-onset to CP was 13 (IQR 9-17) days in this study vs. 30 and 45 days in previous reports (10, 13) . Based on previous work, virus persistence has been linked to severe disease and poor outcome (2) . In addition, promising therapies for COVID-19 showed faster decline in viral load in treated vs. control groups (10, 27) or progressive reductions in uncontrolled studies (7) (8) (9) . Thus, the inability of CP therapy to promote viral clearance may reflect the severity of our study population, which may have limited any potential benefit of CP.",

            "text": "The web-based survey was developed by study team members and reviewed by 21 members of the NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN Endoscopy Committees to ensure ease of completion and content relevance. Feedback was incorporated into the final instrument which consisted of forty-five questions in 7 major sections. The first section of the survey asked 3 questions to verify that individuals completing the survey were pediatric gastroenterology division and group heads, defined as the primary person overseeing the operations of a gastroenterology division or group that focuses on providing gastroenterology services to individuals under the age of 21. Section 2 collected division/group demographics. Sections 3 probed changes to practice and care delivery that were made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic relating to four areas of service provision: inpatient, ambulatory, endoscopic and non-endoscopic procedures, and infusions. Section 4 collected information on priorities for re-opening related to the aforementioned services. The fifth section asked division and group heads to estimate the impact of the pandemic on clinical and research activities at the peak of the pandemic as compared with the year prior, while section 6 probed the financial impact of the pandemic, including estimated revenue losses and strategies implemented to mitigate financial loss related to the pandemic. The final section was comprised of open-ended questions which asked individuals to outline implementations related to the COVID-19 pandemic that were successful, ongoing challenges and recommended strategies to prepare for a resurgence of COVID-19 and/or another future pandemic.",

To maximize response rates, the survey utilized a user-friendly design with clear language. Data collection remained open for July and August 2020, and two reminder emails were sent 2 and 4 weeks after the initial email. Survey data were collected using Qualtrics\u2122 (Qualtrics, Provo, Utah) web-based survey platform through Children's Hospital Los Angeles. Participants were informed that survey completion was voluntary, and results would be reported anonymously and analyzed in aggregate.",

            "text": "For questions related to strategies implemented to mitigate the financial impact of the pandemic, differences in survey responses between those divisions/groups situated in countries with and without statutory health insurance were compared using chi square. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. SAS statistical software (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for statistical analysis. For the open-ended questions, free-text responses were reviewed independently by 2 authors (SST and CMW), and themes were identified using a qualitative inductive content analytic approach 1 , in which all comments were read independently to identify codes emerging from the data. Codes were then iteratively refined through discussion into categories called themes and applied across responses, and the frequency with which each theme occurred was then characterized. o Rapid conversion to telehealth across clinical settings and services, including gastroenterology and multidisciplinary clinics, inpatient consultations and rounds, and dietitian consultations o Modified clinic templates that allow for a mix of in-person and telehealth visits that can be adjusted based upon the phase of re-opening o Pre-visit check-in whereby support staff review and test software with patients and families, obtain records and register patients virtually prior to the virtual clinic o Triage of patients using telehealth to determine need for in-person visit o Ongoing frequent telehealth monitoring of active patients o Implement routine SARS-CoV-2 testing prior to all endoscopy and aerosol-generating gastroenterology procedures o Consider routine SARS-CoV-2 testing for all inpatient admission o Implement formal screening protocols at ambulatory centers that include screening for COVID-19-related symptoms, exposure history, and temperature checks o Consider routine SARS-CoV-2 testing of staff, if feasible o Develop a plan to anticipate and mitigate ancillary staff/service reductions o Leverage electronic platforms (phone/text/websites) to disseminate information quickly and update families on current processes o Continue to evaluate strategies as new information arises",

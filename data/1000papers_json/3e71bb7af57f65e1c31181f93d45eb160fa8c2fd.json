And the patients were divided into two groups depending on presence or absence of nintedanib therapy. Comparisons, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and propensity score matching were made to identify difference in time to death from any cause, incidence of rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD) and comorbidity of pulmonary infection between the two groups. The following logistic regression analyses and Cox proportional-hazard regression analyses were used to verify the therapeutic value of nintedanib as well as clinical significance of other factors. Adverse events were descriptively recorded.",

Before and after propensity score matching, the primary comparisons revealed better survival (P = 0.015, P = 0016, respectively) and lower incidence of RP-ILD (P = 0.017, P = 0.014, respectively) in patients with nintedanib therapy. Logistic regression analysis identified that disease activity (P < 0.001), percent-predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO%, P = 0.036), nintedanib therapy (P = 0.004, OR value = 0.072) and amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM, P = 0.012) were significantly correlated with RP-ILD. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis suggested that disease activity (P < 0.001), anti-MDA5 antibody (P < 0.001) and nintedanib therapy (P = 0.013, HR value=0.268) were significantly associated with survival of IIM-ILD patients. Similar results can also be seen in analyses after propensity score matching. In the 36 patients with nintedanib therapy, diarrhea was the most common adverse event (44.4%) and hepatic insufficiency contributed to most dosage reduction (44.4% of nine patients) or therapy discontinuation (60.0% of five patients).",

            "text": "Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) comprises a group of autoimmune diseases featuring systemic inflammation of the proximal skeletal muscles and/or the skin (1, 2) Dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) are two classical subtypes of IIM, whereas amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM) is a newly recognized subgroup of DM with typical skin rash of DM and slight/absent muscular impairment (1) (2) (3) . IIM contributes to elevated morbidity and mortality rate due to severe muscle weakness as well as multiple organ involvement including esophagus, heart, and lungs in particular (4) . Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most common extra-muscular target in IIM patients, with a reported prevalence of 78%, and is found in 65% of newly diagnosed IIM cases (5) (6) (7) . Idiopathicinflammatory-myopathy-related ILD (IIM-ILD) is frequently aggressive and refractory to conventional therapies including glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs (7) (8) (9) . In different studies, the incidences of rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD) in IIM patients were relatively high (24-8%) compared to those in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF, 8.6-23.9%) and systemic-sclerosis-related ILD (Ssc-ILD, 9.4%) (10) (11) (12) (13) . RP-ILD has been taken as a major cause of mortality in IIM patients (14, 15) . To alleviate lung involvement, immunosuppressive medications could be potent and sometimes costly, which also made the patients vulnerable to infection (16) . Under such circumstance, it would be necessary to take a broader view and search for more potent therapeutic agent for IIM-ILD.",

Preceding research in animal models with manifestations of fibrosing ILDs like IPF, Ssc-ILD, rheumatoid-arthritis-related ILD (RA-ILD), hypersensitivity pneumonitis and silicosis has uncovered that nintedanib has anti-fibrotic effect regardless of the trigger for the ILD pathology (20) . Furthermore, the therapeutic value of nintedanib has been suggested in IPF and Ssc-ILD via TOMORROW, INPULSIS-1, INPULSIS-2 trials as well as several real-world analyses (21) (22) (23) . The SENSCIS trial proved the efficacy of nintedanib in Ssc-ILD with a majority of non-UIP pattern (24, 25) . The most recent INBUILD trial suggested that nintedanib reduced the rate of ILD progression in patients with chronic fibrosing ILD and progressive phenotype, including autoimmune ILD with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or non-UIP pattern (26) . However, the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in the subtype of IIM-ILD remain unclear. The unfavorable outcome, potent immunosuppressive therapies, the frequent comorbidities of RP-ILD and infection precipitated us to seek to introduce nintedanib into therapy of IIM-ILD.",

To obtain the survival, incidence of RP-ILD and pulmonary infection in all the patients involved, patients were followed from the initial outpatient visit or hospitalization until the end of follow-up. For patients who perished during hospitalization, their dates of death were clearly documented in the EMR system. For patients who were discharged, a routine return visit was arranged 2 weeks after discharge. In addition to the regular inpatient or outpatient visits, a concise telephone interview was performed 3 months after discharge, and at an annual frequency afterwards. The end of follow-up could be owing to death from any cause, loss to follow-up, or closure of follow-up for the purpose of this study (September 30th, 2020). In patients receiving nintedanib therapy, initial dosage, dosage adjustment, discontinuation and duration of nintedanib as well as adverse events were also collected from the EMR and follow-up records. Time to death from any cause and occurrence of RP-ILD in the follow-up were our major concerns. Since comorbidities and progression of ILD usually lead to more potent immunosuppressive therapy and the subsequent comorbidity of pulmonary infection in clinical practice, comorbidity of pulmonary infection was also taken into account. Due to the initial lack of follow-up lung function testing pandemic, decline of forced vital capacity (FVC) was not listed as an end point in this study. Adverse events mainly incorporated diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, hepatic insufficiency and cough.",

Baseline disease activity assessment, lung function testing and HRCT scan were performed at the initial outpatient visit or within the first week of hospitalization. ILD and its progression were evaluated by experienced radiologists using HRCT. Cases manifested as definite or probable UIP pattern were recognized based on their HRCT appearance: the presence of basal-dominant reticular opacities and predominantly basal and subpleural distribution of honeycomb lesions, with multiple equal-sized cystic lesions of 2 to 10 mm diameter with a thick wall (29) . A subset of patients with RP-ILD was defined as those presenting with progressive dyspnea and progressive hypoxemia, a worsening of interstitial change on the chest radiograph within 1 month after the initial visit or onset of respiratory symptoms (30) (31) (32) (33) . Infection, pulmonary infection in particular, was a common comorbidity in IIM patients and a key contributor to unfavorable outcome. Identification of pulmonary infection relied on International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10)-coded discharge diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), pulmonary fungal infection or pulmonary infection. Responsible pathogens were recognized based on repeated cultures/smears of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or sputum before related treatment.

In this study, all IIM-ILD patients received potent immunosuppressive therapy.

Efficacy and tolerability of nintedanib in IIM-ILD patients were hereby a worthy subject. To date, this is the first clinical research focusing on nintedanib therapy in IIM-ILD patients. Nintedanib was found effective in reducing incidence of RP-ILD and improving survival in these patients. However, patients receiving nintedanib therapy did not suffer from less comorbidity of pulmonary infection. Tolerability of nintedanib therapy was as well-evaluated by recording and discussing the adverse events, dosage reduction and discontinuation of the therapy. Admittedly the non-randomized process of inclusion contributed to the heterogeneity between the two groups. Patients who accepted nintedanib therapy tended to have higher disease activity (as measured by MYOACT score) as well as worse lung involvement (as measured by DLCO%). However, propensity score matching was used to adjust for the heterogeneity between the two groups. After propensity score matching, less RP-ILD and better survival could still be identified in patients receiving nintedanib therapy.",

            "text": "Nintedanib has already been proved of therapeutic value in reducing lung function decline and acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) in IPF patients. The previous TOMORROW trial, INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2 trials demonstrated that nintedanib promisingly reduced the annual rate of decline in FVC (21, 22) . The therapeutic effect of nintedanib remain consistent irrespective of age, sex, ethnicity, and baseline percent-predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) (35, 36) , and the efficacy in slowing lung function decline could last over 3 years (37) . Similar results were also reported in several real-world experience across Europe during the Compassionate Use Programs (CUPs) or after license (38) (39) (40) . In addition, the TOMORROW trial and INPULSIS-2 trial also demonstrated that nintedanib played a protective role in preventing AE-IPF (41) . In INPULSIS-2 trial, nintedanib significantly increased the time to the first acute exacerbation. Meanwhile the incidence of acute exacerbation was reduced in TOMORROW trial. The following INPULSIS-ON trial also suggested that nintedanib's therapeutic effect in reducing occurrence of acute exacerbation persisted beyond 3 years. In SENSCIS trial, nintedanib was identified to decrease FVC decline in Ssc-ILD, nevertheless, its effect on RP-ILD was not probed into (24) . The recently completed INBUILD trial demonstrated the consistent effect of nintedanib on reducing FVC decline in different ILD subgroups, irrespective of the underlying ILD diagnosis (26) . In our study, nintedanib was found to reduce the incidence of the fatal RP-ILD in IIM-ILD patients, which for the first time suggested the therapeutic value of nintedanib in IIM-ILD regardless of the retrospective nature and lack of follow-up lung function testing. In the future, large-cohort, prospective, multicenter research concerning IIM-ILD is demanded to verify the role of nintedanib in decreasing incidence of RP-ILD, as well as explore its effect in lung function decline, etc. In addition to decreasing the incidence of RP-ILD in follow-up, nintedanib was also observed to benefit the survival of IIM-ILD patients. Similar finding in IPF patients was also reported in an Italian multicenter study with a favorable 1year survival of 79% (42) . On the one hand, RP-ILD has been identified as a risk factor for death in IIM-ILD patients (14, 15) . Nintedanib might improve IIM patients' survival by reducing the incidence of RP-ILD. On the other hand, nintedanib was still found to play a protective role in survival after adjusting for RP-ILD, etc., which led us to consider the possible therapeutic value of nintedanib beyond ILD. In preclinical models of systemic sclerosis, nintedanib was confirmed to alleviate skin fibrosis by decreasing of dermal thickness, myofibroblast counts and hydroxyproline content (43) . However, no clinical benefit of nintedanib was identified for extra-pulmonary manifestations of systemic sclerosis in SENSCIS trial (24) . In terms of IIM, preceding studies proposed the essential role of tyrosine kinase in type I IFN signaling in pathogenesis of DM (44) . As a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (45) , the effect of nintedanib on disease activity, muscular or extra-muscular involvements as well as pathogenesis of IIM, DM in particular, is worth exploration in the future. The benefit of nintedanib in survival of IIM-ILD patients demanded further verification in longer therapeutic regimen and follow-up period.",

Almost half of nintedanib-treated patients finally received reduced dosage of nintedanib or discontinued the therapy. The incidence of adverse events was much lower than those (\u223c90%) reported in preceding clinical trials possibly owing to exclusion of ILD progression, upper respiratory tract infection, etc. from adverse events (21, 22, 24, 26) . Diarrhea was the most common adverse event in IIM-ILD patients, which resembled the reports from series of clinical trials and real-world analyses (21-23, 26, 38-40, 46) .

On the one hand, lower DLCO% indicated decreased gasexchanging function of lung and the subsequent hypoxia. Hypoxia might induce progression of ILD via augmenting oxidative and inflammatory pathways, increasing the total lung collagen content and heterogeneous structural alterations (50, 51) . On the other hand, lower DLCO% could be taken as an early-stage manifestation of progression of ILD since ILD and its progression could result in impaired diffuse capacity through alveolar structural alteration, thickening of alveolar capillary wall, etc. However, the unsatisfying OR value of DLCO% in predicting RP-ILD made it less valuable in clinical practice. Previous studies also proposed that RP-ILD was more frequently seen in ADM patients, possibly owing to the higher CD4/CD8 ratio in ADMrelated ILD patients (48) (49) (50) . ILD patients with higher proportion of CD4+ T cell in BALF and peripheral blood tended to be rapidly progressive (52, 53) . Similar elevated ratio can also be seen in BALF of ADM-related ILD patients (54) . Confirmation of the role and mechanism of higher CD4/CD8 ratio in RP-ILD demanded further exploration.",

Due to the initial lack of follow-up lung function testing and recent impact of COVID-19 pandemic, we failed to clarify the effect of nintedanib on lung function decline. The judgment of RP-ILD mostly relied on progression of symptoms and HRCT alterations, instead of worsening of lung function testing. Alterations of life quality, MYOACT score, muscle strength, etc. after nintedanib therapy were not recorded as well. Baseline FVC%, DLCO%, age, immunosuppressive therapy, etc. were not controlled for inclusion because of the limited number of IIM-ILD patients receiving nintedanib therapy. No placebo was given to patients in the control group. Last but not least, underestimation of RP-ILD might occur in patients under conventional medications owing to initial lack of mandatory management. In spite of all the limitations, we intended to initially figure out the therapeutic value of nintedanib in IIM-ILD, and shed some light on the future therapeutic landscape of CTD-ILD.",

Among IIM-ILD patients receiving nintedanib therapy, diarrhea was the most common adverse event. Hepatic insufficiency frequently led to dosage reduction or therapy discontinuation.",

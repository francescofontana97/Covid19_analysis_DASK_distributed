Globally, prevalence of violence against older persons has increased significantly over the last two decades. 1 One in six older persons experiences elder abuse in the past year. 2 Older persons' safety may be particularly compromised during the current COVID-19 pandemic as they experience increased exposures to wide-spread age-based discrimination, social isolation with perpetrators and reduced options for support. 3 The associated social, psychological and financial stressors further present significant barriers for reporting and help-seeking. 4 To this end, the United Nations (UN) has called for improved protection for older persons' safety and wellbeing during this health crisis. 5 Addressing violence against older persons require population-level solutions. The WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have strongly recommended the integration of a socio-ecological framework in violence prevention research and practice. 6 Based on this multi-level model, risk factors for violence against older persons operate across individual, Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba The current study, which is based on 56 countries that represented 63.1% of the world's ageing population aged 60 and over across all six of WHO regions, is one of the largest cross-national investigations on violence against older persons to date. \u25ba The ecological analysis examines a previously unexplored link between structural ageism and violence against older persons. \u25ba A strength of our investigation was it examined country-level structural ageism for the first time by combining social norms and laws; this methodologically validated approach was informed by extensive scholarship on other types of structural stigma including of women and sexual minorities. \u25ba The robustness of the structural ageism-violence linkage was supported by three additional sets of sensitivity analyses. \u25ba The ecological design with country-level information could be strengthened by adding individual-level data.",

However, the majority of research on violence against older persons pertain to individual factors. 7 Compounding this lack of evidence beyond individuals is the disproportionate focus on the deficits of victims that erroneously suggests victims are to be blamed. 8 Societal-level risk factors in violence against older persons deserve more attention given that interventions could be most effective when context-changing strategies are in place. 9 This knowledge void may be owing to a few conceptual, measurement and methodological challenges. While contexts shape interactions, existing theories have largely overlooked the ways in which macrolevel factors, such as policies and cultural norms specific to ageing, may be linked to downstream individual behaviours. Additionally, cross-national comparisons are lacking in this line of research. 7 With data typically collected in a single country, participants' responses may be restricted by the particular cultural climate in that country, hence, limiting the understanding of the role of societal determinants on violence victimisation and perpetration across cultures. 10 As the most widespread form of bias and prejudice, 11 12 ageism harms older persons' health simultaneously at both structural and individual levels. At the structural level, ageism is manifested in the forms of explicit and implicit policies, practices or social norms that impose bias and discrimination against older persons. At the individual level, ageism is manifested by negative age stereotypes and negative self-perceptions of ageing. As premised by the stereotype embodiment theory (SET), 13 both levels are closely intertwined because individual-level ageism is assimilated by older persons from surrounding cultures that propagate structural ageism. A recent systematic review based on 7 million older participants across 25 years found evidence the injurious health effects of structural ageism existed across country borders, but none of the studies included examined violence against older persons as its health outcome. 14 There are strong theoretical and empirical evidence from parallel tracks of stigma and violence research against women and sexual minorities to suggest the potential link between structural ageism and violence against older persons. 15 As suggested by SET, a plausible psychological pathway may be that ageism operating at the structural level could trickle down to shape individuals' negative age beliefs, which in turn affect behavioural outcomes. 13 Additionally, one might postulate that in social contexts that denigrate a group, individuals tend to be more accepting of violence toward that group. For instance, research in family violence has found that cultures with greater sexism exhibited higher tolerance of intimate partner violence. 16 17 Finally, considering structural ageism embodies a sociopolitical climate that disempower older persons, the embedded hierarchical power relations may also leave older persons with less resources to protect themselves from violence and its associated risk factors. However, until now, the assumed link between structural ageism and violence had not been tested. 18 19 In this present study, we predicted that structural ageism would be associated with greater prevalence of violence against older persons, after adjusting for socioeconomic and health risk factors.",

[22] [23] [24] Discriminatory social policies referred to macro-level policies and practices that discriminate against or restrict the resources and opportunities for older persons. In order to match with prejudicial social norms that were measured between 2010 and 2014 in the WVS, the presence of four policies between 2010 and 2014 selected for the present index reflected four core components of human rights protection in the Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging, 25 including economic, social, civil and political rights. 26 As the most comprehensive international policy framework to address population ageing, 27 the Madrid Plan strives to eliminate all forms of violence and discrimination against older persons. 26 In our index, the protection of economic rights was based on whether or not each country had enacted pension reform laws including raising retirement benefits of workers as initially reported by country, and then subsequently validated and reported by UN experts in UN's World Population Policies database. 28 The protection of social rights-or recognising older persons as a social group deserving of their own rights, was assessed by coding the presence of national policies that included healthy ageing as a priority policy. Each country self-reported whether or not they have Open access developed laws to protect the well-being of their ageing populations. Data were collected and compiled by United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). 29 The protection of civil rights was based on the existence of employment non-discrimination policies for older workers, drawn from expert evaluation in the publicly available Employment Protection Legislation Database, UN's International Labor Organizations. 30 The protection of political rights was based on the existence of constitutional-level protection against age discrimination, reported by each country and compiled by UNFPA. 29 The absence or presence of each of these four policies were summed into a continuous variable, ranging from 0 to 4. Higher score indicated that a country had greater structural ageism, as indicated by fewer policies protecting older persons. Overall, 17.9% had one discriminatory policy, 42.9% had two discriminatory policies, 16.1% had all four indicators of discriminatory policies. Only one had zero (Spain) (see online supplemental table 1).",

GBD defined interpersonal violence according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 (X85-Y08.9, Y87.1) 34 that covered three categories: (1) physical assault by any means, including firearm, bodily force, sharp or blunt objects, (2) sexual assault by bodily force and (3) mistreatment, neglect and abandonment, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, torture and cruelty. The prevalence of violence victimisation used in this study was prevalence rate of both fatal and non-fatal violence victimisation per 100 000 persons in the age group of 70 years and over that covered all three categories of interpersonal violence.",

The wide variation in country-level attitudes toward older persons was in line with previous cross-cultural analyses. 53 54 In the domain of policies, we also found variation in the level of each country's protection toward older persons. This may be a reflection of the gap in existing legal provisions and international conventions specifically supporting the rights of older persons. 55 Congruent with intersectional theories, 56 our findings showed that countries reported higher structural ageism coincided with those that also reported greater inequality in other realms of stigma. For instance, Nigeria ranked among the highest in structural ageism in this study as well as highest in structural stigma against sexual minorities in a recent cross-cultural study of 197 countries. 57 The opposite estimate was found in Spain where it ranked among the lowest in both structural stigma measures. Parallel scholarship in gender-based stigma also recently found that women residing in countries with greater structural-level gender-based stigma were more likely to experience violence. 58 Indeed, both older age and female gender could be potential modifying factors in the association between ageism and violence. As structural systems of oppression are often mutually manifested to reinforce health inequalities, analyses that only focus on gender, race, ethnicity alone are insufficient to understand population-level health disparities. 59 Future multi-level analyses that combine both population level and individual level data may assist in addressing the examination of these intersectional axes between older age, sex and structural stigma in predicting violence.",

            "text": "Integrating structural ageism as a societal-level risk factor in existing elder abuse research may also help inject a multi-systemic, sociocultural lens in developing muchneeded interventions. 60 Theories of elder abuse have been predominantly interpersonal in nature, where victims of abuse were typically described as uniformly dependent and powerless. [61] [62] [63] The emphasis on older persons' vulnerabilities is not only a form of victim-blaming, but also shifts our attention away from the broader status inequality that each individual is embedded in. Considering the ways in which structural ageism seep through social interactions and its downstream consequences in shaping the inherent power imbalance between victims, perpetrators and their environments can offer promising opportunities for primary prevention strategies. 64 Our findings have a few limitations that point to future research directions. First, given that violence in general and elder abuse in particular is stigmatising and illegal in most of the countries, it is possible that the violence against older person was under-reported. Second, the current ecological study design did not allow us to produce casual inference between structural ageism and violence against older persons. However, there are two reasons that we consider it likely that greater structural ageism led to greater risk of violence. First, it does not seem likely that the reverse of a diagnostic health outcome would influence a structural-level variable. Second, to ascertain temporal association, our structural ageism variable was based on estimates in 2010-2014, that predated violence prevalence outcome in 2017. Finally, although we used global data with consistent definitions that allows for cross-national comparisons, the aggregate data structure would not permit individual-level interpretation. Future investigations should further assess whether the observed structural ageism-violence linkage extends to the individual level.",

First, ageism that operates at both individual and structural level deserves more consideration in estimating the occurrence of violence and abuse in older persons. Second, social and legal Open access policies are inherently public health policies. 65 Social policies that protect the rights of older persons may reap significant public health benefits for populationlevel violence preventions. Third, as existing approaches for violence preventions are tailored toward individual ecology, positioning structural ageism as a societal risk factor of violence against older persons may help catalyse a paradigm shift in refining current primary preventions against violence and abuse. Such structural approach may focus on reducing ageism through improving politicallegal, economic, as well as intergenerational support for older persons. 66 Other ways that policy makers and public health officials can mitigate effects of structural ageism could be by establishing societal-wide campaigns that promote older persons' rights and enhance diverse representation of ageing through social media. 67 ",

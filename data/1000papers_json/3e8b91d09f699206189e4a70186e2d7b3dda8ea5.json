Despite improvement in the recent past, laboratory diagnosis, particularly molecular detection of the virus by polymerase chain reaction, remains unreliable, especially in the first few days of the disease; in addition, the tests are not yet validated. Serologic analysis is thought to be the confirmatory laboratory test, but most patients with SARS develop detectable IgG antibody levels 3-4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Thus, differential diagnosis remains a problem for the clinician at the time of initial presentation, particularly in individuals without known exposure to other patients with SARS or history of travel to a region where SARS is endemic.",

Vero E6 cell monolayers were treated with ribavirin at various concentrations (0, 20, 50, 100, 200, 1000, and 2000 mg/mL) for 96 h. Treatment was initiated concurrently with inoculation of the cell cultures with virus at an MOI of 0.001. Inhibition of viral cytopathic effect (CPE) was used to determine the antiviral effect of the drug. No reduction in CPE was detected after 4 days, compared with untreated control samples. Viral titers determined from tissue culture supernatant were identical for treated and untreated cells and amounted to \u223c10 6 pfu/mL (data not shown). Ribavirin was tested up to concentrations 10 times greater (2000 mg/mL) than those that inhibit the replication of ribavirin-sensitive viruses, such as arenaviruses and bunyaviruses [9, 10] . There was no evidence that the SARS CoV was susceptible to the action of ribavirin. IFN susceptibility has been demonstrated for several coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and human coronavirus [11] [12] [13] [14] . Inhibitory concentrations ranged from 2 IU/mL [12] to 1000 IU/mL [14] . Therefore, we tested the susceptibility of the Tor2 isolate to IFN-a-2b (Schering-Plough). In brief, Vero E6 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.001, either 20 h after or at the time of treatment with IFNa-2b (250-5000 IU/mL). Treatment was continued for 72 h. The CPE was used to demonstrate an antiviral effect. As indicated in figure 1 , the CPE on day 3 after infection was significantly decreased in Tor2-infected cultures treated with 1000 IU/mL of IFN-a-2b in both treatment groups, compared with that in the untreated control group. This indicated that pretreatment was not necessary for the protective effect in tissue culture (data not shown). Almost complete protection was achieved when infected Vero E6 cells were treated with 5000 IU/mL of IFN-a-2b.",

After 72 h, cells and supernatants were harvested to determine protein expression by immunoblot analysis and virus yield by plaque titration on Vero E6 cells. As indicated in figure 2A , a concentration of 1000 IU/mL of IFN-a-2b substantially reduced virus yields, and \u223c1 log decrease in virus yield was achieved at a dose of 2000 IU/mL of IFN-a-2b. The reduction in virus yield seems to be related to a decrease in virus growth, as supported by the change in the plaque morphology ( figure 2B ). Inhibition of viral protein expression was investigated by use of immunoblot analysis after SDS-PAGE of the cell lysates ( figure 2C ). A serum sample from a patient with SARS who seroconverted to the SARS CoV was used to detect viral proteins. Earlier studies had shown that this serum sample reacted strongly with the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS CoV [15] . Viral protein expression was reduced at a concentration of 1000 IU/mL and abolished at concentrations of 2000 and 5000 IU/mL of IFN-a-2b. For confirmation, the effect of IFN-a-2b on 3 additional independent SARS CoV isolates (Tor3, Tor7, and Tor684) obtained from Canadian patients with SARS was determined. All isolates showed the same pattern of inhibition by IFN-a-2b as . B, Analysis of cell-to-cell spread of SARS CoV in the presence and SD absence of IFN-a-2b. Vero E6 cell monolayers were infected with 10fold dilutions of the SARS CoV. After 1 h of virus adsorption, the inoculum was removed, and cell monolayers were overlaid with 0.9% low-meltingpoint agarose in DMEM (B2) or DMEM containing 5000 IU/mL of IFNa-2b (B1). On day 3 after infection, cells were stained with crystal violet. C, Protein analysis. Cell lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Protein was electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P membrane; Millipore). Viral antigen was detected by use of a patient serum sample and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG, by use of enhanced chemiluminescence. NP, nucleoprotein. D, Comparison of the effect of antiviral activity on different SARS CoV isolates. Vero E6 cells were infected with 4 independently isolated SARS CoVs (isolates Tor2, Tor3, Tor7, and Tor684) and were analyzed for their sensitivity to IFN-a-2b, as described above.",

This is significant, because Vero E6 cells have been shown to have an IFN I gene deficiency and thus are unable to express endogenous IFN I [18] . However, the IFNdependent pathways are functional and can be activated by exogenously provided IFN. We have tested a limited number of different cell lines (HeLa, 293T, 3T3, and CRFK) for susceptibility to the SARS CoV; thus far, we have failed to identify another line that supports viral replication (data not shown). The observation that the Vero cell clone E6 propagates the virus may indeed be related to the lack of a functional IFN system and, thus, supports the findings in the present study.",

Recently, cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) have been infected with the SARS CoV, which induced similar clinical symptoms and pathological findings to those of humans with SARS [19] . Because only a limited number of animals have been used in the present study, it remains to be determined in the future whether the cynomolgus macaque is a suitable model for SARS and, thus, for antiviral in vivo studies. Until an animal model is definitively established, it might be justified to consider clinical trials with IFN, which is already approved for human use, to determine whether IFN has a beneficial effect on the outcome of SARS CoV infection. Combined with the observation of a lack of efficacy of ribavirin in patients with SARS, our in vitro data further support the conclusion that ribavirin, at least alone, is unlikely to be beneficial in the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS CoV infection. Whether combined therapy with IFN-a-2b and ribavirin would inhibit the replication of the SARS CoV in vitro has not yet been evaluated; the combination is more effective than either agent used alone for the treatment of HCV infection in humans.",

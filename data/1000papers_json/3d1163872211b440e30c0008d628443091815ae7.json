To such linear groups, one may apply the recent superapproximation results (cf. [Sal17, Sal19] ). Superapproximation means that the quotients of the Cayley graph of (W, S) modulo congruence subgroups are expanders. These quotients are not highly regular graphs, but they are quasi-isometric to highly regular quotients of X (see Lemma 4.1), from which we deduce (in Proposition 4.4) that the latter are also expanders.

In this paper, we manipulate three different kind of links, in three different classes of objects: spheres around cliques in a graph, (simplicial) links around simplices in a simplicial complex, and (polytopal) links around faces in a polytope. Even though the first two notions agree when the simplicial complex in question is the clique complex of a graph (cf. \u00a72.2), and the last two agree up to a certain rank in a polytope with only simplicial faces up to that rank (as we will use in the proof of Lemma 3.2), they differ in general. For instance, when a polytope P has a 2-face F which is not a triangle, the sphere in the 1-skeleton of P around a vertex v of F is a proper spanning subgraph of the 1-skeleton of the (polytopal) link of v in P. Care thus has to be taken when discussing links, and the context should make clear which notion of link is involved.

In the Tits cone of (W, S), place a point x 0 on the intersection of the walls associated with S \\M (the inactive mirrors of the kaleidoscope), equidistantly from the walls associated with M (the active mirrors). The vertices of P W,M are the images of x 0 under W . The point x 0 is connected by an edge to each of its reflections under S (or equivalently, M ); and the edges of P W,M are the images of those edges under W . More generally, the images of x 0 under any standard parabolic subgroup of W form a standard face of P W,M , and arbitrary faces are obtained as images of standard faces under W . Incidence between two standard faces amounts to containment between the smallest standard parabolic subgroups corresponding to these faces (see below), and this incidence relation is propagated to P W,M by the action of W .",

Indeed, the shape of faces and links in P W,M can be read directly from the adorned diagram \u2206. The different faces of P W,M are also Wythoffian polytopes, whose adorned diagrams are all obtained through the following recipe. Remove from \u2206 any subset R of vertices (not containing M ), and let \u2206 R be the union of the connected components of the resulting diagram which intersect M , with the vertices of M remaining circled. Then \u2206 R is the adorned diagram of (any image of) the standard face corresponding to the standard parabolic subgroup generated by the vertices of \u2206 R (seen as vertices of \u2206). In particular, the rank of this parabolic subgroup coincides with the rank of the corresponding face. Although it works in greater generality, for our purposes we will restrict the discussion of the link to connected Coxeter diagrams \u2206 adorned with only one circle (that is, (W, S) is irreducible and M is a singleton). In this setting, the link of any vertex of P W,M is again a Wythoffian polytope, whose adorned diagram is obtained by removing M and all edges connecting it from \u2206, and circling all vertices of this new diagram \u2206 \\ M that were previously connected to M .",

In order to apply Theorem 5.2 to an indefinite Coxeter group W , it remains for us to observe that W can indeed be seen as a subgroup of GL N 0 (Z[1/q 0 ]). The attentive reader may foresee Weil's trick of restricting scalars. The entries of the matrix of 2B in the canonical basis of V are algebraic integers, and so there exists a number field K, with ring of integers O K , over which the algebraic group O B can be defined in such a way W \u2282 O B (O K ). The restriction of scalars Res K/Q (O B ) is a linear algebraic Q-group, and as such can be embedded over Q in GL N 0 for some N 0 . If one is careful with the construction of Res K/Q (O B ) and the choice of the embedding in GL N 0 , then one can ensure that the image of W lies in GL N 0 (Z). Otherwise, let q 0 be a lowest common denominator of the entries of the image of S. Then S, and hence also W , is a subset of GL N 0 (Z[1/q 0 ]).

The Coxeter systems studied here are all known to have finite index subgroups which map onto non-abelian free groups [NV02] . This implies that at the same time, we could choose suitable (non congruence) normal subgroups which give rise to HR-graphs with exactly the same local structure but which are not expanders. This is of interest in light of Garland theory [Gar73] . Garland theory shows that the 1skeleton of simplicial complexes are expanders when the links are \"sufficiently good\" expanders. Our examples show that in fact the links need to be strong enough expanders in order to deduce global expansion. Thus the popular statement saying that Garland theory implies that expansion of high-dimensional simplicial complexes is a local property should be formulated in a careful and quantitative way.",

Now to check that the 1-skeleton X of such a polytope P W,M indeed has regularity level n, we argue as follows. Since s 0 lies at the end of a unique path of length n \u2212 1 in the diagram, one sees inductively that for \u22121 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1, the link of an i-face is again a Wythoffian polytope, hence is vertex-transitive. This implies that the sphere S X (C) of radius 1 around any clique C of size i + 1 in X is a vertex-transitive graph. In particular, it is a i+1 -regular, with a i+1 again counting the number of (i+2)-faces containing a given (i+1)-face.

John Conway is perhaps best known for his contributions to combinatorial game theory, especially the 'Game of Life', and for the discovery of three of the sporadic finite simple groups. But he also made fundamental discoveries across a very wide range of other topics, including knots, lattices, numbers, polyhedra and tilings. Ernest Vinberg is best known for his work on discrete subgroups of Lie groups and representation theory. He introduced Vinberg's algorithm for finding a fundamental domain of a hyperbolic reflection group, and he developed some beautiful theory of the arithmetic nature of co-finite hyperbolic Coxeter groups and the combinatorial-metric structure of their Coxeter polyhedra in terms of the Gram matrix. (Also incidentally, Conway was a great admirer of Coxeter, whose groups play a key role in this paper, and he used Vinberg's algorithm to describe the automorphism group of the 26-dimensional even unimodular Lorentzian lattice II 25,1 in terms of the Leech lattice.)",

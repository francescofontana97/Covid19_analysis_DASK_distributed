This has led to the formation of powerful platforms leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to effectively commoditise individual attention, with the average person spending over 2 h a day on social media (Statista, 2020) . The ubiquity of these platforms underscores the need to better understand social media in the context of public health, in particular its potential risks and benefits. This will facilitate comprehensive assessment of its impact on healthcare services, development of mitigating strategies for its drawbacks, and identification of potential opportunities to leverage its strengths for the good of population health.",

            "text": "These sentiments were recently echoed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, calling upon member states to address misinformation through risk communication and timely dissemination of accurate information as a key pillar of national public health responses (World Health Organisation, 2020a). However, our collective experience during this pandemic highlights the limitations of our existing knowledge and approaches, as many countries continue to experience the spiralling social impact of misinformation related to COVID-19. This manuscript provides an overview of both the negative and positive public health impact of social media that has come to light in the course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on rampant disinformation during COVID-19, and concludes with potential future directions for research in this emerging area of public health. Viral Infodemic in Social Media outpaces the Pandemic in the Streets-the (Un)truths The COVID-19 outbreak that originated from Wuhan city, China, has already claimed over 1 million lives and infected over 40 million individuals since it was first reported in December 2019. With the initial spread of COVID-19 progressing to pandemic status, the WHO also recognized the parallel problem of widespread anxiety and emotional sharing of information through digital platforms. This imposed an additional strain on humanity's coordinated attempts to eradicate COVID-19, hindering public health risk communication (The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 2020). Experts have studied big data in online search and social media with many reports highlighting surges in online misinformation in each region even before the uptick in confirmed cases (Hong et al., 2020) . Poor quality online sources have drowned out official advisories with fake and potentially harmful information (Cuan-Baltazar et al., 2020) . This presents major health concerns given the public's difficulty in differentiating reliable from unreliable sources of medical information, even among individuals with good baseline health literacy (Huhta et al., 2018) .",

The WHO has since identified this phenomenon as an \"infodemic\", making calls for novel solutions to moderate the flow of accessible information and stem medical disinformation (World Health Organisation, 2020b). A recent survey of social media users in Kurdistan, Iraq further emphasised the negative impact of this problem, whereby the researchers have reported how health-related content featured prominently in social media during COVID-19 with fake news accounting for over a quarter of \"fear-inducing\" content (Ahmad and Murad, 2020) . This study was not appropriately designed to evaluate the relationship between social media content and fear, which was also inflated by selection bias. However, it does highlight the pervasiveness of this problem particularly considering the prominence of social media in modern life. This begets the need for solutions to adjudicate content in social media, and provide a check and balance to the spread of misinformation via these viral platforms.

These capabilities have been demonstrated for the evaluation of the public's compliance to public health measures as well as the evaluation of national responses to help control the pandemic in China, using data from social media such as Weibo and Tik Tok, the People's Daily major Chinese newspaper, and online market research agency platforms such as Mob-Tech research institute (Hua and Shaw, 2020) .",

(Li S. et al., 2020) . These terms reflect greater group cohesiveness given the threat to greater public, and these findings were further replicated in Lombardy based on data from Italy (Su et al., 2020) . Notably, the increased group cohesion occurred in tandem with more monetary and supply donations to regions of need and key organisations including the Hubei Red cross (Li S. et al., 2020) . It is thus evident that social media can be leveraged for positive impact, by helping to connect individuals during a crisis and improve individual alignment for common good. This has additional implications for other aspects of medication, including the use of these platforms for health promotion and raising awareness about critical health-related problems (Horrell et al., 2019) . Through further investigation and refinement of these methods, public health organisations will be able to optimise response strategies in real-time by extrapolating trends in transmission, communication content, information flow, and population sentiment.",

Presently, the negative impact has gained much visibility and criticism, due to limited mechanisms for differentiating reliable information from misinformation, and mitigating the risks of the latter. Fortunately, increasing coordination between social media platform providers, non-governmental organisations, and governments have given rise to promising collaborations such as the \"Share verified\" initiative led by the United Nations (UN) to build a freely-accessible resource of reliable health content and front-end flags to redirect individuals to reliable sources in order to address misinformation. Ultimately, long-term solutions may require new legislation to govern the creation and dissemination of misinformation online. Regulations have been effectively applied for other public health challenges, such as tobacco advertising regulations to reduce population exposure to marketing and cues to smoke (Henriksen, 2012) .",

The disease was attributed to infection by a novel member of the coronavirus family, named SARS-CoV-2 1 . In contrast with the two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV (outbreak in 2002) and MERS-CoV (outbreak in 2012), the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 had a lower fatality rate, but it could spread from person to person more e ciently 2 . The outbreak spread worldwide 3 , and by March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the disease, by then named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a global pandemic. COVID-19 is currently a leading public health concern in countries worldwide as the hospitalization rate and death toll increase daily (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). Apart from mitigation efforts, there is an urgent need for effective treatments for patients showing severe symptoms. After Chinese researchers published the rst sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in January 4 , many groups worldwide began working to develop an effective vaccine. Some of the candidates are undergoing clinical trials, among them two promising candidates from Oxford University and Moderna, Inc., that are entering Phase II 5 . However, clinical approval of the vaccines will take some time; consequently, the best solution in the interim is to look for drugs that have already been approved for humans and that may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved remdesivir, an antiviral drug targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, for COVID-19 treatment after a clinical trial run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases found it to reduce the time to recovery in treated patients compared to the control group 6 . However, the drug did not show signi cant improvement in patient survival. Thus, there is still a persistent need to search for alternative candidate drugs that can be used as single or as combination therapy to bene t patients with severe illness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 209, "end": 210, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 483, "end": 484, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1826, "end": 1827, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Researchers are also exploring targeting of the host receptors of SARS-CoV-2 as another potential solution.

We included a microarray-based transcriptomic data set of PBMCs of 40 SARS-infected and 10 heathy individuals from a paper published in 2007 13 . For both of these transcriptomic data sets, we performed single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) for a set of curated pathways collected from the Broad Institute Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and a set of immune function pathways collected from published resources [16] [17] [18] . While checking the differential enrichment of immune functions between COVID-19 vs. healthy as well as SARS vs. healthy patients, we found that the macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells (MoMaDC), B cells, pathogen defence, and interferon signalling were the common immune functions with high enrichment in both COVID-19-and SARS-infected patients compared to healthy patients ( Figure 2 ). On the other hand, among other pathways, androgen biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, potassium channel, proteasomes, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, tryptophan metabolism, and p53-dependent DNA damage response were the common functions that were highly enriched in both COVID-19-and SARS-infected patients compared to healthy patients ( Figure 3 ).

We collected the list of drugs targeting these host proteins from DrugBank and DGIdb databases 10, 11 . Additionally, we procured the list of drugs currently in trial for COVID-19 treatment from literature (https://www.excelra.com/COVID-19-drug-repurposingdatabase/data). The resulting list comprised 289 potential drugs for COVID-19. Using the drug perturbational data sets from CMAP 14 , we found the drugs that affected the gene expression of these targets (differences in gene expression at 24 hours vs. 6 hours of drug treatment). We mapped 221 drugs to the drug perturbational data set from CMAP. The network in Figure 4a shows the drugs and SARS-CoV targets, which get signi cantly downregulated at 24 hours compared to six hours of the respective drug treatments (76 drugs) along with the drugs in clinical trial for COVID-19 treatment (Figure 4a , Supplementary Dataset 1 shows the list of drugs and their targets). Many of these drugs have been already reported as potential treatments for COVID-19 and/or SARS (Table 1) , including sirolimus, apicidin, mercaptopurine, midostaurin, camostat, metformin, fedratinib, ribavirin, entacapone, azacitidine, and chloroquine. Next, we sought to check if the drugs are effective in the context of transcriptomic changes in COVID-19 or SARS patients after infection. We checked the effect of these drugs on the perturbation of the pathways upregulated or downregulated after SARS and COVID-19 infection ( Figure  4b ). In CMAP, gene expression is pro led in cell lines treated with drugs at different dose/time points, and we see how drugs change the expression of a given set of genes. To get a pathway-based estimation instead of individual genes, we calculated ssGSEA scores for the differentially enriched pathways in COVID-19 or SARS infection for all drug-treated cell lines at different dose/time points. Then the ssGSEA scores of a pathway were compared between two time points (24 hours vs. 6 hours) in cells treated with a certain drug using student's t-test. Among all drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2-interacting proteins, 60 drugs altered the COVID-19/SARS differentially enriched pathways in a time-dependent manner.

We reasoned that the viruses SARS-CoV-1 (causing SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-19) share many similarities, and the symptoms of the infected patients are also similar, though SARS infection causes more severe symptoms and a higher fatality rate 19 . Another limitation of our study is the availability of drug perturbational and drug sensitivity screening data in human cell lines. Many of the drugs targeting the potential SARS-CoV-2-or SARS-CoV-1-interacting proteins did not have drug perturbational data available in human cell lines from CMAP, and only a few drugs have the drug sensitivity screening data available from GDSC, which is limited to drugs commonly used in cancer treatment.

Among the common pathways, androgen biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, proteasome, tryptophan metabolism, and mitotic cell cycle-related pathways were upregulated due to infection, while TCR, Interleukin 2, TGF-beta receptor signaling, and beta-cell development pathways were downregulated. Among the immune pathways, MoMaDC, B cells, and interferon responses were elevated in patients with COVID-19 and SARS infection, while T-cell and NK cell functions were downregulated. Many of these pathways have been previously implicated in viral infections. Androgens have already been linked to the severity of COVID-19 as possible mechanisms driving disease outcomes 20 . Steroid, proteasome, and tryptophan metabolisms are linked to viral infections and subsequent host immune response [21] [22] [23] . Moreover, monocyte and macrophage activation has been linked to the hyperin ammatory phenotypes in SARS-CoV-2 infection that have adverse clinical outcomes 24 . By analysing the drug perturbational data sets from CMAP, we identi ed drugs that can upregulate or downregulate the pathways that get altered due to COVID-19/SARS infection. As at this point, it's unclear which pathways will be clinically bene cial for COVID-19 treatment when inhibited or elevated. We provided the full map of all drugs that 1) downregulate the pathways that get upregulated due to COVID-19/SARS infection, 2) upregulate the pathways that get upregulated due to COVID-19/SARS infection, 3) upregulate the pathways that get downregulated due to COVID-19/SARS infection, and 4) downregulate the pathways that get downregulated due to COVID-19/SARS infection. Some drugs that could downregulate the androgen biosynthesis pathway (upregulated due to COVID-19/SARS infection), which is linked to severe outcomes, are ponatinib, amlexanox, lenalidomide, menadione, and decitabine. The drugs vorinostat, panobinostat, tacrolimus, lovastatin, midostaurin, daunorubicin, cytarabine, digitoxin, digoxin, mercaptopurine, bortezomib, azacitidine, and clofarabine could downregulate the mitotic cell cycle-related pathways and proteasome activity. The mitotic cell-cycle arrest and uniquitin-proteasome pathway systems play an important role in viral replication for coronaviruses 22, 25 . Drugs that could downregulate the MoMaDC cell pathway potentially linked to severe symptoms in COVID-19 patients 24 are menadione, decitabine, amlexanox, mercaptopurine, nicotinamide, and pevonedistat.

Assessing the effect of potential drug candidates on the pathways altered in COVID-19 and SARS infection Drug treatment sensitivity or resistance also depends on the genomic and transcriptomic features of tissues. The upregulated or downregulated pathway signatures of virus-infected patients can impact the sensitivity or resistance to the drugs targeting SARS-Cov-2-interacting proteins.

If the upregulated (or downregulated) pathways are associated with reduced half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of a drug targeting a SARS-CoV-interacting protein, then we can infer that the pathway alteration makes the cell lines less resistant to drug treatment.

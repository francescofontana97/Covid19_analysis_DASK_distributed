There are several factors involved in the epidemic spreading such as the individual characteristics of each city/country. The true shape of the epidemic dynamics is a large, complex system such as most of the social systems. In this context, Complex networks are a great candidate to analyze these systems due to their ability to tackle structural and dynamical properties. Therefore this study presents a new approach to model the COVID-19 epidemic using a multi-layer complex network, where nodes represent people, edges are social contacts, and layers represent different social activities. The model improves the traditional SIR and it is applied to study the Brazilian epidemic by analyzing possible future actions and their consequences. The network is characterized using statistics of infection, death, and hospitalization time. To simulate isolation, social distancing, or precautionary measures we remove layers and/or reduce the intensity of social contacts. Results show that even taking various optimistic assumptions, the current isolation levels in Brazil still may lead to a critical scenario for the healthcare system and a considerable death toll (average of 149,000). If all activities return to normal, the epidemic growth may suffer a steep increase, and the demand for ICU beds may surpass 3 times the country's capacity. This would surely lead to a catastrophic scenario, as our estimation reaches an average of 212,000 deaths even considering that all cases are effectively treated. The increase of isolation (up to a lockdown) shows to be the best option to keep the situation under the healthcare system capacity, aside from ensuring a faster decrease of new case occurrences (months of difference), and a significantly smaller death toll (average of 87,000).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Although we have experienced several pandemics throughout history, COVID-19 is the first major pandemic in the Modern Era.

Scientific and medical knowledge was much more limited, making it difficult to fight the disease. Furthermore, the world was not globalized, the means of transport were not as agile as the current ones and the population was much smaller. The 21st century is marked by globalization and an intricate and intense social network, which connects in one way or another to everyone on the planet.

Besides, infected people take a few days to manifest symptoms, which can be severe or as mild as a simple cold. There is even a large proportion of infected people who remain asymptomatic [37] . This makes it practically impossible to quickly identify the infected and apply effective measures to limit the spread of the disease. Also, Sars-CoV-2 was discovered in December 2019, which makes it very recently in the face of the current epidemic. Little is known about the COVID-19 disease, which appears to be highly lethal, with no drugs to prevent or treat.

According to [11] , there are only 9 hospital beds per 100,000 people in the North region while Southeast accounts for 21 hospital beds. The treatment of severe cases requires the use of respirators/ventilation in intensive care units (ICU), and if simultaneous infections occur there will be no beds to meet the demand and a possibly large number of victims. Thus, it is urgent to develop models and analyses to try to predict the evolution of the virus. Also, as noted in Figure 1 , Brazil is running towards being the next epicenter of the pandemic.

The approximation of real social phenomena was first explained by Milgram [29] in [29] , the sociologist is the author of the well-known idea that there are up to six people separating any two individuals in the world, which reinforces the importance of analyzing the epidemic spread from a graph view. In [33] , the authors used small-world networks to simulate a SIR model, however, they considered that every contact with an infected person resulted in contamination, which is not realistic.

Considering the confidence intervals, here we roughly approximate it to an average of 30% of the total number of infected cases.

Moreover, our diagnosis rule is also based on the fact that ongoing tests in Brazil are increasing more slowly than in most European countries and the USA (tests are being performed mostly on people that need hospitalization). If a given case is severe or critical, the patient goes to a hospital and is fully isolated, i.e. we remove all of its connections. This is a rather optimistic assumption, considering that these patients still may infect the hospital staff. Concerning the time that patients usually stay at hospitalization/ICU, the works [10, 44] points to an average of 14 days for all cases. For standard hospitalization, we considered a minimum of 6 days and a maximum of 16 days of stay, and for the ICU/Ventilation, a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 17 days of stay. The time of each case will depend on the day the symptoms start and the day of recovering/death. Figure 3 illustrates all the infected states and mechanisms described here.

Firstly, we analyze the impacts on the number of daily new cases and deaths, results are shown in Figure 6 . As previously mentioned, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil was performing a fewer number of tests by an order of magnitude, in comparison to other countries with similar epidemic numbers, therefore we considered as diagnosed only the severe and critical cases, which are pronounced subjects for testing, and 20% of the mild cases. The total infection ratio is discussed later. Considering keeping the current isolation levels, the peak of daily new cases occurs around 100 days after the first case (June 5), with around 11,000 confirmed cases. After 202 days (September 15), the average daily cases is around 500, and it goes below 100 daily cases after around 237 days (October 19). The peak of daily new deaths occurs around 118 days (June 23), with an average of 1900 deaths, and goes below 100 new occurrences after around 210 days (September 24). It is important to stress that this is a hypothetical scenario where the isolation level remains the same from day 27 to 300, which is hardly true in the real world where it is constantly changing [22] . The total numbers after the last day (300) account for 946,830 (\u00b110, 507) diagnosed cases and 149,438 (\u00b13, 124) deaths. When we consider the return of all activities after 90 days, the number of cases and deaths grows significantly in an exponential fashion. The peak occurs at 108 days (June 13) with an average of 40,937 (\u00b1 11,010) new cases, and at 122 days (June 27) with an average of 6,484 (\u00b1 1,739) new deaths. Although the peak of cases/deaths and the decrease of the numbers occur early, in this case, the final result is critically worse, with a total of 1,340,367 (\u00b1 18,513) diagnosed cases and 212,105 (\u00b1 4,359) deaths. Here it is important to notice that we considered that all the activities return after 90 days and remain fully operational until the last day (300). Moreover, we do not account for the overloading of hospitals, which directly impacts the final death count. Therefore, the number of deaths may be considerably higher. Another possible scenario is the return of only the work layer, keeping reduced transports and no schools and religious activities, however, the pattern is similar to returning all activities, considering the growth time, peak, and decay time.

The peak of daily new cases happens around day 93 (June 1), and of daily new deaths around day 106 (June 11). The total numbers of diagnosed cases and deaths after day 300 are, respectively, 552,855 (\u00b1 195,802) and 87,059 (\u00b1 30,871). Considering the hospitalization time described in the scheme of Figure 3 it is possible to estimate the number of occupied beds for regular hospitalization (severe cases) and ICU/Ventilation (critical cases). We also show the difference between the cumulative growth of diagnosed and undiagnosed cases and recovered cases. The same approach as the previous experiment is considered (except for \"return work\") with 3 possible actions after 90 days (May 26), results are shown in Figure 7 . The overall pattern of results is similar to the previously observed for the number of diagnosed cases and deaths. It is possible to notice that the number of undiagnosed cases is much higher than the diagnosed cases. This reflects the number of asymptomatic cases and the lack of tests for mild cases. In the worst scenario, which means ending the isolation, the total infected number may go above 5 million cases. The recovered rate is directly proportional to the infected rate, as one needs to be infected to either die or become resistant to the disease. If the infected rate is high, so is the recovered rate, e.g. the scenarios of keeping or ending isolation, and a high recovered rate also helps in mitigating the epidemic propagation (natural immunization). However, increasing isolation decreases the propagation much faster than natural immunization, with a considerably smaller death toll.

However, the results show that the hospital occupancy is prolonged considerably in this scenario, and they may stay functioning around their maximum capacity for up to a month (with an average of occupied ICU beds above 30,000).

Moreover, the shape of the curve throughout the days is different and the final numbers are considerably smaller. The peak also occurs around a week earlier and then decreases much faster.

We then considered that only hospitalization cases and 20% of the mild cases are diagnosed. Asymptomatic cases are not diagnosed and keep acting normally in the network, considering the active layers.

After 27 days of the first confirmed case, the first isolation measures are taken where schools and religious activities are stopped and work and transports keep functioning at 30% of the initial scale (achieved further reducing the \u03b2 term). Different actions are then considered after 90 days of the first case: keep the current isolation levels, increase isolation, end isolation returning all activities to 100%, or returning only the work activities. The results show that keeping approximately the current isolation levels results in a prolonged propagation, as we are near the estimated peak (around June 5) with an average of 11,000 daily new cases and 1900 daily new deaths, and an average of 946,830 diagnosed cases (up to 3,6 million infected) and 149,438 deaths until the end of the year. In this scenario, hospitals may exceed its maximum capacity around June 11, but the efficient implementation of new ICU beds and good logistic management of patients may still keep the situation under control. However, this is a very optimistic assumption, considering that our definition of \"keep isolation\" considers social isolation above 50% as registered at the beginning of the Brazilian quarantine [22] . The social isolation levels in Brazil are constantly decreasing even when we are still in a state of moderated quarantine, and it is possible to observe average isolation below 50% in most days of the past month (middle of April to middle of May 2020). Moreover, the results show that this prolonged scenario may cause hospitals to keep functioning at maximum capacity for up to a month. When analyzing other possible scenarios the situation may be considerably different. Relaxing isolation measures from now on causes an abrupt increase in the daily growth of cases and deaths, up to 5 times higher in comparison to the current isolation levels. Even if only work activities return while schools, religion, and transport activities remain inactive/reduced, the impact is very similar to returning all the activities, with a possible number of above 1,34 million diagnosed cases (up to 5,2 million infected), and around 212,105 deaths until the end of the year. This is, again, a very optimistic assumption as we do not consider the hospital overflow to calculate the death toll. Considering this aspect, ICU beds may be fully occupied in early June, and around the middle of the month their demand may reach up to 134,000 beds, which is around 3 times higher than the entire country's capacity. The other alternative, which is the increase of isolation levels (lockdown), appears to be the only alternative to stop the healthcare system from entering a very critical situation. In this scenario, the growth in the number of daily cases and deaths would be mitigated, and faster. As we are near the peak of new cases at current isolation levels, estimated to be between the beginning and middle of June, increasing the isolation levels does not cause a significant impact on when the peak occurs or its magnitude.

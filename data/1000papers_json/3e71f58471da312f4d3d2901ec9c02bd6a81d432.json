Better characterization of re-positive cases is urgently needed. Methods: Clinical data were obtained through Guangdong's COVID-19 surveillance network. Neutralization antibody titre was determined using microneutralization assays. Potential infectivity of clinical samples was evaluated by cell inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using three different RT-PCR kits and multiplex PCR with nanopore sequencing. Findings: Among 619 discharged COVID-19 cases, 87 re-tested as SARS-CoV-2 positive in circumstances of social isolation. All re-positive cases had mild or moderate symptoms at initial diagnosis and were younger on average (median, 28). Re-positive cases (n = 59) exhibited similar neutralization antibodies (NAbs) titre distributions to other COVID-19 cases (n = 218) tested here. No infectious strain could be obtained by culture and no full-length viral genomes could be sequenced from re-positive cases. Interpretation: Re-positive SARS-CoV-2 cases do not appear to be caused by active reinfection and were identified in~14% of discharged cases.

Our results also highlight a significant feature of re-positive cases. All rere-positive cases in our study developed only mild or moderate symptoms in the initial diagnosis, with the median age being significantly lower than that of the general COVID-19 cases ( Table 1) . The relatively mild symptoms may explain why the median time from onset to discharge in re-positive cases (median 17 days) is slightly lower than that of the other discharged COVID-19 cases (median 33 days). It is unlikely that cases tested as re-positive because they were discharged too early since all re-positive cases tested negative for both nasopharyngeal and anal swabs in two successive tests before discharge.

Therefore, it is important to know if re-positive cases are infectious. One previously proposed reason for prolonged detection of viral RNA in deceased patients is impaired neutralizing ability [14] . Our microneutralization result shows that 58 of 59 (98%) re-positive cases generated specific NAbs to SARS-CoV-2, and their titre distribution is similar to cured COVID-19 cases that were SARS-CoV-2 negative after discharge and to hospitalized COVID-19 cases (Fig. 1b) . Recent studies of non-human primates suggests that primary infection enables the animals to develop anamnestic antibody responses following re-challenge by SARS-CoV-2, and that protective efficacy against re-challenge was mediated by rapid immunologic control [16, 17] . Therefore, the possibility of active infection in repositive cases appears to be low. In order to evaluate the possible infectivity we also attempted live virus isolation on clinical samples from re-positive cases.

Together with the above results, it is more likely that the re-positive discharged cases are caused by intermittent shedding of cells containing remnant RNA fragments of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Secondly, we did not obtain samples during the acute infection for the repositive cases. Therefore, some virological questions remain, including whether there any genetic differences among SARS-CoV-2 viruses sampled in the acute re-positive phases.

Re-positive detection of viral RNA in some discharged cases poses challenges for some interventions, such as a prolonged isolation phase and created requirements for hospital isolation facilities. Our study shows that NAb response in re-positive cases are comparable to those from other COVID-19 cases. More importantly, no of infective strains could be successfully isolated and no intact viral genomes could be sequenced from all re-positive cases samples. This likely excludes the possibility that re-positive cases represent active infection and indicates a lower risk for disease transmission from such cases. Additional public health messages relating to SARS-CoV-2 re-positive results may to educate the public and improve the allocation of limited medical resources. 3) are coloured in red.

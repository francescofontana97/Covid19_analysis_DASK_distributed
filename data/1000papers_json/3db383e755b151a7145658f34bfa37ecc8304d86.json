We use a casebased example to find types of biases that could affect second opinions. Although the baseline expected utility theory model presented assumes providers are rational, we relax this and discuss the implications for how these alternative specifications alter predicted use. We found that second opinions are valuable when diagnostic accuracy is variable across physicians or access to high-quality care is restricted. In a stylized simulation example in which about half (50.1%) of diagnoses were incorrect, receipt of 1 second opinion reduced the error rate to 25.8% and receipt of 2 second opinions reduced the error rate to 16.0%. After incorporating potential biases into the model, the value of second opinions increases only when aversion to changing the initial diagnosis is greater than aversion to correcting a mistake. Additionally, this model reveals that second opinions have value even when diagnostic accuracy is perfect. Further, when financial incentives differ from the incentives of the initial consult, a second opinion offers patients a reasonable bound of their treatment options. To conclude, we identify numerous reasons for underuse of second opinions. Specifically, value depends on the degree of diagnostic uncertainty, presence of behavioral biases, and variation in local compensation regimes. Despite their value, recent trends could actually decrease the value of second opinions.",

For instance, the Massachusetts-based \"Best Doctors\" offers \"second opinion\" coverage, which includes independent case review by a panel of experts representing the top 5% of US physicians.",

The emergence of clinical practice guidelines has changed care by providing evidence-based care pathways that may limit the need for second opinion requests. 7 In Israel, most physicians support second opinions outside the inpatient setting, but many of them stated that providing a second opinion within the hospital was forbidden or a \"collegial taboo.\" 8 Providers also shy away from second opinions owing to litigation fears. Providers have concerns that a change in diagnosis or treatment options could expose the primary provider to a malpractice claim. 9 Although some patients and providers believe that second opinions are not needed, extensive evidence indicates that provider diagnostic accuracy is highly imperfect. In the case of thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies, for example, diagnostic disagreement occurred in 26% of cases in one study 10 and 13% in another. 11 In urologic cancers, Wayment et al 12 found a 10% diagnostic disagreement whereas another study examining them noted a discrepancy in scoring in 15% of samples, with 46% requiring a upgrade and 54% being downgraded. 13 Similar rates of disagreement occur for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication doses, 14 detection of abnormalities in neuroradiology studies, 15 and testicular cancer therapy plans. 16 Another study from Mayo Clinic in 2017 established that only 12% of final diagnoses were the same as the initial, with 66% better defined/refined, and 21% had a substantially different diagnosis. 17 Another study in 2014 reported that 1 in 20 patients were misdiagnosed. 18 This relatively high misdiagnosis rate affects the quality of care patients receive. Second opinion reviews of FNA biopsies could reduce the need for diagnostic thyroidectomy in 25% of patients with no increase in false negatives, and second opinion consultations in thyroid FNA increased biopsy accuracy from 60% to 74%. 19 ",

Even in the case in which provider diagnostic accuracy is observable, patients still may not be able to always select higher quality providers. In a free market, higher quality physicians will charge more, limiting access. Even if third-party payers fix reimbursements, high quality providers will likely have longer waiting times, and thus access to high quality providers will be restricted or may opt to practice outside the health insurance system (eg, concierge medicine).",

When patients receive 1 second opinion, the share of patients with an incorrect diagnosis falls considerably by half to 25.8%; adding another second opinion makes this figure fall substantially again to 16.0%; a third second opinion drops the rate of the incorrect diagnosis to just under 1 in 10 patients (9.9%).",

            "text": "This article developed a simple economic model to find the value of second opinions for both diagnostic and treatment decisions. Second opinion visits can correct clinical errors in both diagnosis and treatment recommendations and/or correct provider incentives when the initial provider has a financial stake in a different diagnosis or more likely a different treatment recommendation. The model reveals that physician behavior may increase or decrease the value of second opinions when new information arises. In this dynamic model, the initial provider may be less likely to change an existing or initial diagnosis despite the admission of new information because of hindsight or ego bias, which impairs the ability of the initial provider to change their assessment and treatment recommendations. Second opinions help address this problem, as the second provider is not exposed to those biases. However, there is evidence that the initial diagnosis can also bias the consulting practitioner who is providing the second opinion, especially in circumstances in which the 2 providers may have an established relationship. 29 New technology models using telemedicine have shown promise in this area. One study compared the management of 2 different groups of diabetic patients and found no statistical difference. 31 Another study, looking at patient-reported outcomes using remote orthopedic consultations, found 85% preferred video consultation, and no differences were noted in patient-reported health over 12 months. 32 When financial incentives influence treatment recommendations, second opinions help patients establish bounds for reasonable treatment options. For instance, a patient may receive a treatment recommendation without knowing whether this recommendation is relatively aggressive or relatively conservative compared to the average treatment level. Following up on our case example, he was sent for further work-up with a different surgeon via a telemedicine evaluation and was recommended to have an epidural injection and ongoing conservative care. He was more satisfied with this encounter as the surgeon took the time to explain the different options and allowed the patient to make an informed decision. The initial surgeon was clearly interested in performing surgery, a more aggressive treatment, with higher compensation, than considering other options. Compensation may affect how physicians frame the \"standard\" treatment for a given diagnosis. By seeking second opinions from physicians paid under different reimbursement systems (ie, FFS compared with capitation or salary), patients can set bounds for reasonable treatment options and gain a better understanding of whether the original treatment recommendation meets their individual preferences for aggressive vs conservative treatment.",

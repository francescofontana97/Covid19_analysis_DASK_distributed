Organizations with a positive safety culture are characterized by communications founded on mutual trust, by shared perceptions of the importance of safety, and by confidence in the efficacy of preventive measures.\" [1] A safety culture should therefore evaluate psychological aspectsin other words, how people's reactions to safety processes vary according to their values, attitudes, and perceptions; behavioral factors, that is, what people do within the organization regarding safety culture; and situational factors, referring to what is reported by the organization in terms of its policies, regulations, etc.",

[3] [4] [5] Different methodologies exist for analyzing patient safety culture and its various dimensions, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] and this can sometimes make it difficult to compare and assess any differences that may exist on an organizational and individual level. [12] [13] [14] [15] Such comparison and assessment is fundamental to developing an optimum level of safety culture and facilitating decisionmaking. [16] This idea is derived from the need to know the true attitudes, beliefs, and practices of the organization in combination with its human capital, to optimize patient safety. If these factors are not clearly and promptly known, it is difficult to improve. This need requires clarification in both developed and developing countries. Studies such as the comparative database report, [7] have transformed the experience of assessing safety culture into a tool for continuous improvement.",

Laboratories usually have quality management systems to streamline their processes, which could influence a higher level of safety culture and the lowest in the care unit of Traumatology and Orthopedics (PSCI: unfavorable = 36.48). Occupational factors continue to be the primary predictors of the index. Units that handle a high volume of patients such as internal medicine, ICU, surgery, and pediatrics, among others, presented moderately unfavorable rates. Likewise, as in all areas, labor factors persist as the highest predictors of the index (sig = 0.01); followed by the communication factors and then the organizational factors. Finally, due to the theoretical importance of the notification of adverse events, the study highlights this idea and makes a specific assessment of this indicator, as shown in Table 4 . It shows the indicators that were significant predictors of whether a professional reported adverse event or not; the highest indicator was \"management expectations and actions\" (Omnibus test sig = 0.048), which acted as a protection factor (ODDS = 0.59), that is, a predictor of reporting. The second highest indicator was \"direct involvement with the patient\" (sig = 0.049) (see Table 4 ), classified as a risk factor (coefficient value for this variable = 0.606, sig = 0.048, and odds ratio = 1.834), that is, that being in direct contact with the patient or the first line of care is in itself a factor of opportunity and predisposition to report.

This is the first investigation to analyze the Patient Safety Culture by calculating an Index whose usefulness as a control variable is to compare and relate other variables. [26] A new theoretical methodological model is proposed to analyze and measure the level of safety culture and its predictors through resulting factors that contain indicators of a known and validated instrument (HSOPSC). [21] After an institution undergoes this analysis, the results it provides, in our view, are more objective and specific than other measurement methods. The use of the index and the factors, allows to objectively visualize the measurement of culture, and facilitates the implementation of improvement actions focused on user participation, [27] promot-ing a cultural environment with greater awareness of the problem, increases the skills of human capital, and consequently improves the quality of the services provided.

Our model proposes an interpretation of the safety culture measurement through the value of an index and the factors that determine it; unlike the HSOPSC survey that establishes an analysis by means of a mean percentage of positive responses on patient safety. On the other hand, the HSOPSC survey makes the measurement based on the 12 dimensions of the safety culture, as established by the theory; however, our model, although it is nourished by it, proposes 3 factors that are defined each by the nature of the indicators that compose it, providing knowledge about this area, showing that the dimensions have a mutual nature and are not aspects isolated.",

Staff confidence can be an influencer; the risk may be associated with an overconfident, arrogant, and authoritative attitude, which tends to be seen more often in individuals with more experience. [33] [34] [35] . 2. As professionals are exposed to \"continuous\" and \"extreme\" work stress due to the poor conditions in which they carry out their work, they are susceptible to burn-out syndrome, [36] where over their professional lives healthcare professionals can start to depersonalize patients, putting their health at risk and jeopardizing and undermining the organizational culture. [12, 32] Communication factors are also critical in care units as well as in their relationship with other hospital settings, [15] due to the multiple interactions that a patient has during a hospital stay. [31, 37] The indicators of communication such as \"teamwork between the units,\" \"feedback or communication of errors\" and \"adverse event reporting,\" [16, 24, 25, 37] have been identified as predictors in other studies, [37, 38] where safety culture levels were high or favorable. These findings placed special emphasis on reporting as an attribute of a positive patient safety culture as it increases awareness of patient safety issues, especially in the first line of medical care. [39] In this case, and coinciding with a study conducted in Lebanon, [37] in the study population what determines whether a professional reports an AE or not, is the level of \"management expectations and actions to promote patient safety\" [37, 39] and \"direct interaction with the patient.\" In this sense, these professionals are exposed to high levels of stress as a result of their proximity to the patient care process, [33] which tends to lead to a greater incidence of AE [11] ; however, this premise makes them more aware of the need to report. [40, 41] Nevertheless, it has been noted that although healthcare professionals may be prone to report errors, if these errors persist and are repetitive, their willingness to report diminishes. [41] The greater the gap between the perceptions of leaders and professionals in the front line of care, the greater the risk of making mistakes. [11] Evidence has shown that communication problems, whether simple or complex, are major contributors to adverse events and may undermine patient safety. [11, 24, 36] Highquality and safe care depends on the ability of suppliers to communicate well with patients and other healthcare professionals. [16, 36] Nursing staff interact directly with patients more frequently than other professionals and are the main source of interception of incidents and events. Nursing staff are also more receptive to the implementation of these ways of working and therefore report errors more frequently, [32, 41] a fact that is supported in this study as the PSCI is higher for these staff than for other professionals. [34] Institutions should promote a culture of organizational learning within an environment that provides a safe place for the sharing of any information that may lead to improvements and help create a climate of trust. [16] The fact that both public and private sector institutions have obtained a moderately low PSCI (see Table 1 ) may be due to the systematic crisis situation being experienced by the healthcare sector over the past 15 years, which has affected both sectors. Healthcare workers in Venezuela tend to work in both sectors, which partly explains why the healthcare culture is perceived similarly in both sectors, taking into account that the lack of resources and precariousness are the same in both types of institution, with 3 main clear scenarios:",

[42] This is also the first study published in Venezuela on patient safety culture although there are a few studies comparing the safety culture variable between public and private institutions. This study confirms that private hospitals tend to report 51.6% less than public hospitals in our survey sample (X 2 = 17.7, P < .05). [19] One explanation is that under-reporting may occur in private institutions, due to the reasons described in the literature, which include fear, humiliation, and a punitive response to the error. [39, 43] In the case of Venezuela, employment contracts at private institutions allow employers to dismiss workers more easily than at public hospitals. [44] The above-described findings generate a basis for further studies with a broader scope and contribute to building a model that offers us a different perspective for analyzing patient safety culture. [37, 40] Our research therefore serves to promote more indepth research and the reengineering of knowledge to create a proper knowledge base.",

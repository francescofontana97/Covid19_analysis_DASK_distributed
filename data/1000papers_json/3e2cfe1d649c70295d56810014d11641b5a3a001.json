The transcellular pathway utilizes a tyrosine kinase dependent, gp60-mediated transcytotic albumin route, an active process of albumin transport in which endocytic vessels fuse with the endothelium in response to surface glycoprotein (gp60) receptor ligation [8] . However, there is general consensus that the primary mode of fluid and transendothelial leukocyte trafficking occurs by the paracellular pathway as shown by the elegant electron microscopy studies of Majno and Palade [9, 10] , who demonstrated lung EC rounding and paracellular gap formation at sites of active inflammation within the lung vasculature.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 626, "end": 629, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 849, "end": 852, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 853, "end": 856, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 364, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Transcellular Versus Paracellular Permeability"}, {"text": "Disruption of the integrity of the EC monolayer is now recognized as a cardinal feature of inflammation, ischemiareperfusion injury, and angiogenesis and occurs in response to a variety of mechanical stress factors, inflammatory mediators, and activated neutrophil products [reactive oxygen species (ROS), proteases, cationic peptides].

Thus, although once perceived as a passive cellular barrier, ECs are now recognized as a highly dynamic tissue contributing to the multiple dimensions of EC function, including interactions with a number of barrier-regulatory effectors via the endothelial cytoskeleton. The duration and outcome of inflammatory disease processes depends upon the balance between the severity of endothelial injury caused by adhesive biophysical forces, mechanical shear stress (SS), or receptor ligation by specific inflammatory mediators and the efficiency of endogenous repair mechanisms to restore vascular integrity [1, 2] .

Historically viewed as separate and distinct cytoskeletal systems, microtubules and actin filaments are now known to interact functionally during dynamic cellular processes. The microtubule scaffolding complex [11, 12] , with a central role of tubulin dynamics, actively contributes to cytoskeletal rearrangement and in transducing competing barrier-regulatory forces, often in close collaboration with microfilament elements.

Studies with nmMLCK knockout mice have revealed protection from sepsis-induced ALI and our laboratory has shown that nmMLCK knockout mice, as well as mice treated with an inhibitory peptide which reduces MLC kinase (MLCK) activity, are protected against ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [20] . In addition, we have shown that genetic variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) in MYLK, the gene on chromosome 3q21 encoding MLCK, confer significant susceptibility to sepsis, and sepsisand trauma-induced ALI [21] , as well as contributing to risk of severe asthma in African Americans, another inflammatory lung disorder [22] . A key regulatory feature of nmMLCK is the posttranslational modification (PTM) by increased levels of nmMLCK tyrosine phosphorylation catalyzed by either p60src kinase or c-abl kinase, or by inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases (vanadate). This PTM serves to increase kinase activity and modulates EC barrier responses [15, [23] [24] [25] . Diperoxovanadate, a potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, also increased nmMLCK activity, the number of stress fibers, and EC contraction via activation of p60src kinase. The nmMLCK isoform binds cortactin, another actin-binding protein and EC barrier regulator which localizes to numerous cortical structures within cells [25] .

Important functions of microtubules include intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles, as well as signal transduction and cytoskeletal structure. In addition, microtubules act in concert with the actin cytoskeleton to promote EC barrier integrity. Microtubules and actin filaments exhibit complex, but intimate functional interactions during dynamic cellular processes [29] [30] [31] [32] . Microtubule disruption with an agent such as nocodazole or vinblastine induces rapid assembly of actin filaments and focal adhesions, isometric cellular contraction that correlates with the level of MLC phosphorylation, increased permeability across EC monolayers, and increased transendothelial leukocyte migration, events that can be reversed or attenuated by microtubule stabilization with paclitaxel [31, 32]. The mechanisms involved in these effects are poorly understood but are likely to be mediated through interaction with actin filaments, suggesting significant microfilament-microtubule cross talk. Disruption of microtubules causes actin cytoskeletal remodeling, cell contraction, and decreased transendothelial resistance through a Rho kinase induced phosphorylation of MYPT1, a MLC phosphatase [31, 33] . Nocadozole causes formation of stress fibers and myofilament assembly accompanied by increases in MLC phosphorylation, remodeling of AJs [34, 35] , and barrier disruption [31] .

Despite greater diversity than the highly conserved components of either actin microfilaments or microtubules, IF proteins share a common dimer structure containing two parallel a-helices which combine to form polar fibrils that associate with an array of IF-binding proteins while connecting to the nuclear envelope, peripheral cell junctions, and other cytoskeletal components. IF proteins are expressed in a highly cell specific manner, with vimentin being the primary IF protein found in ECs and other cells of mesenchymal origin. Although these data suggest potential roles for IFs in EC cytoskeletal structure and barrier function, these effects are likely to be subtle and subject to compensation by biological redundancy and the function of IFs in EC barrier regulation is much less understood [15] . Assembly of IFs is a complex process likely highly regulated by signaling cascades associated with cell motility. Vimentin is a dynamic structure undergoing constant assembly/disassembly, as well as anterograde and retrograde movements. Microtubulebased movement of IFs is likely critical for assembly and maintenance of the vimentin IF network [37, 38] . The physical and dynamic properties of the vimentin network in the vascular EC are likely important in regulation of cell shape and resistance to hemodynamic stress that accompanies blood flow and resistance to shear strain, physiological changes regulated by the IF cytoskeleton, and IF-associated proteins which serve as internal scaffolding for ECs, linked to the plasma membrane, and to junctional contacts. Vimentin protein expression is higher in macrovascular EC lining vessels subjected to the highest hemodynamic strain, such as the aorta, compared with microvascular EC lining vessels under less SS. Vimentin knockout mice develop normally without gross blood vessel abnormalities, but with reduced mesenteric artery vessel dilation in response to flow [37, 38] . Downstream responses to flow may be the result of intracellular mechanosignaling events triggered by deformation of the IF cytoskeleton. Changes in unidirectional laminar flow results in rapid adaptation of the EC vimentin network, with directional displacement within minutes of initial exposure. As noted with microfilaments and microtubules, over a period of hours, cytoskeletal filaments align themselves in the direction of flow, with significantly larger change in the vimentin distribution around the nucleus compared with displacement occurring in the cytosol closer to the substrate. These observed spatial changes may be a means of distribution of local shear force transmission throughout the cell and therefore convey cell signaling messages via a mechanosignaling pathway. Thus, vimentin IFs are likely critical for maintaining the structural integrity of ECs under SS, and may also be a conduit for signaling cascades triggered by mechanical force, again an exciting area for future examination.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1006, "end": 1010, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1362, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1366, "text": "38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2136, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2137, "end": 2140, "text": "38]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Intermediate Filaments"}, {"text": "Dynamic equilibrium exists between EC contractile forces and the adhesive protein-cytoskeleton linkages with cellcell and cell-matrix interactions necessary for proper barrier function.

The two primary types of intercellular contacts between ECs are AJs and tight junctions (TJs), both of which link the EC actin cytoskeletons of neighboring cells to each other while providing mechanical stability and mediating signal transduction [15] (Fig. 1) . In addition to cell-cell junction stability, cell-matrix interaction also contributes to stability of the barrier function.

The cytoplasmic components of TJs are linked to the EC actin cytoskeleton by the zona occludens family (ZO-1). TJs are particularly abundant and prominent in the brain microvasculature and epithelial cells, where strict control of permeability is needed. In contrast, most microvascular beds of ECs, particularly leaky lung microvasculature, have less defined TJ structures and more prominent AJ structures.

Focal adhesions are attachments of ECs to the underlying ECM and are mediated by ECM proteins (i.e., collagen, fibronectin, laminin, etc.), integrins, and cytoplasmic adhesion plaques (containing vinculin, talin, and paxillin) [48, 49] . Integrins couple the ECM to the cytoskeleton and transmit signals from the surrounding environment and play a key role in the formation of cell adhesion complexes which attach to the actin cytoskeleton via the cytoskeletal proteins actin, vinculin, talin, and a-actinin. Focal adhesions, primarily through integrins, form a bridge for bidirectional signal transduction between the actin cytoskeleton and the cell-matrix interface. Disruptions of the integrin-ECM connection can increase EC permeability [50, 51] and integrins modulate EC permeability to SS and inflammatory mediators [52] . Integrin-ECM binding stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins such as paxillin, cortactin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), as well as calcium influx [53, 54] . FAK is the principal kinase which catalyzes the downstream reactions of integrin engagement and focal adhesion assembly [52], with FAK activity regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by the Src family. Activation of FAK through tyrosine phosphorylation produces cell contraction and increased EC barrier permeability. We previously reported that integrin b 4 expression is dramatically upregulated upon challenge with the barrier-protective agent simvastatin [55] . Furthermore, the upregulation of integrin b 4 attenuates endotoxin-and ventilator-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 [56], suggesting a novel mechanism of modulating endothelial barrier function via integrin b 4 and focal adhesion signaling.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 357, "end": 361, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 362, "end": 365, "text": "49]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 952, "end": 956, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1120, "text": "[53,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1124, "text": "54]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1594, "end": 1598, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Adhesive Protein-Cytoskeleton Linkages"}, {"text": "Inflammatory mediators increase vascular permeability by disrupting endothelial junctions and focal adhesion complexes as well as inducing cellular contraction to open paracellular gaps [49, 57-59]. As TJs and AJs are ideally situated in a locale between cell-cell junctions, they logically are key participants in the control of vascular paracellular permeability and monolayer integrity. Recent studies in brain ECs have focused on the importance of claudins in TJ formation and maintenance [60, 61] . Mice with claudin-5 gene knocked out did not have a morphologically altered vascular network or TJ structures, but the claudin-5-deficient pups died within 10 h of birth owing to size-selective loosening of the bloodbrain barrier against molecules of less than 800 kDa. It appears that moderate redundancy among the claudin isoforms may allow for the formation of the TJ, but not for the complete function of the TJ. Claudin-3 appears to act in concert with claudin-5 to form the tightly organized strand network, but in claudin-5 mutants, claudin-3 can only maintain the barrier against larger molecules [60], suggesting claudin-3 is a structural barrier, whereas claudin-5 is crucial for the dynamic regulation of TJ permeability. Gene inactivation of claudin-1 and occludin also has no effects on vascular morphology or barrier permeability, suggesting a minor role in TJ function in endothelium as compared with claudin-5 and claudin-3 Inactivation of these genes in mice does not cause any defect in the development of the vascular system in the embryo, but in adult mice these molecules play an important role in modulating leukocyte diapedesis through ECs. JAM-Cs however, is unique in that unlike other junctional proteins, it increases endothelial permeability when expressed at the EC surface, suggesting a role in promoting and/or organizing junction formation [64] . This activity is mediated by VE-cadherin activity and actin organization, as well as by kinases and phosphatases that modulate TJ protein phosphorylation and endothelial permeability. Many of the studies on TJ have been using brain ECs, where the adhesion molecules are prominent. Nevertheless, recent studies on lung ECs have demonstrated that despite the less prominent formation of TJs as compared with AJs, TJs may play a critical role in the endothelial barrier dysfunction associated with exposure to particulate matter from air pollution, which has been shown to induce a gradual and prolonged barrier dysfunction in cultured lung endothelium [47, 65] . AJs were found unexpectedly to be unaltered but the TJs, specifically ZO-1, were degraded through a calpain-dependent proteasome pathway, a novel mechanism of lung endothelial barrier regulation. In contrast to TJs, the regulation of lung vascular integrity involving AJs has been well characterized. Although VE-cadherin is present in high concentration in all ECs, different types of vessels appear to modify VE-cadherin expression to complement the vascular barrier function of that particular vessel. Four modes of AJ protein regulation of permeability have been described, all involving VE-cadherin: phosphorylation, internalization, cleavage, and expression. Simultaneous coordination of VE-cadherin phosphorylation and internalization appears to be crucial for a rapid response to an increase in permeability [66], whereas VE-cadherin cleavage and expression are progressive alterations. Edemagenic stimuli induce tyrosine phosphorylation of AJ proteins (VE-cadherin, b-catenin, and p120 catenin), which parallels increases in permeability, with the tyrosine kinase Src implicated in the phosphorylation of AJ proteins as it directly associates with the VE-cadherin/catenin complex, and src gene inactivation or treatment with inhibitors blocks VEGF-induced VE-cadherin phosphorylation [67] . Phosphorylation of VE-cadherin is dependent on kinase activation as well as inhibition of associated phosphatases such as the endothelial-specific phosphatase VE-PTP, which also associates with VE-cadherin, and inactivation of the VE-PTP gene leads to a phenotype comparable to that of VE-cadherin null embryos, suggesting that vessels cannot form correctly if VE-cadherin is constantly phosphorylated [68] . Permeability may also be regulated by VE-cadherin internalization. Typically, p120 catenin binds to VE-cadherin and acts as a plasma membrane retention signal to prevent VE-cadherin internalization; however, upon challenge with barrier-disrupting stimuli, activated Src phosphorylates Vav2, a guanine exchange factor (GEF) for Rac, which then phosphorylates VE-cadherin at Ser665, inducing b-arrestin 2 recruitment and promoting clathrin-dependent VE-cadherin internalization [66]. Angiopoietin 1 induces Src trapping by mDia, reducing its activity at AJs, and thus reducing vascular permeability [69] . The third pathway that may induce vascular permeability is VE-cadherin cleavage. VE-cadherin is particularly susceptible to enzymatic proteolysis, specifically elastase and Adam-10, which are released in high amounts by leukocytes, promoting VE-cadherin cleavage, cell extravasation, and vascular leakage. Lastly, permeability control may also be achieved through VE-cadherin gene expression. The VE-cadherin promoter contains several binding sites for transcription factors, TAL-1, ERG, and hypoxia-inducible factors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 493, "end": 497, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 498, "end": 501, "text": "61]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1880, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2533, "end": 2537, "text": "[47,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2538, "end": 2541, "text": "65]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3837, "end": 3841, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4246, "end": 4250, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4850, "end": 4854, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Endothelial AJs/TJs: Dissociation and the Disruption of Vascular Integrity"}, {"text": "Therefore, the interendothelial junction is a key site of regulating vascular permeability, with various stimuli targeting either the TJ or the AJ, or both.

Contraction triggered in ECs is regulated by nmMLCKcatalyzed MLC phosphorylation on Thr18 and Ser19 which increases actomyosin ATPase activity and shifts the equilibrium between the folded and unfolded myosin forms [74], thus providing the assembling and functioning of the contractile apparatus of the cells. The MYLK gene on chromosome 3 in humans encodes three proteins: the nmMLCK isoform, the smooth muscle MLCK isoform , and telokin [75] [76] [77] [78] . In smooth muscle, nmMLCK is expressed at relatively low level, being present together with a shorter smooth muscle isoform, whereas only nmMLCK can be detected in ECs [78] and exists as a 1,914 amino acid high molecular weight (214-kDa) protein. The nmMLCK shares essentially identical catalytic and CaM regulatory motifs with smooth muscle MLCK, but contains a unique 922 amino acid N-terminal domain comprising potential novel PTM sites [79] . Inflammatory agonists such as VEGF and thrombin produce rapid increases in MLC phosphorylation, reflecting coordinated nmMLCK activity and the small GTPase Rho and its effector, Rho kinase, result in phosphorylation and, thereby, inhibition of the MYPT1 myosin phosphatase, resulting in stabilization and accumulation of phosphorylated MLC.

Long-term exposure of lungs to higher oxygen tension (hyperoxia), as observed with premature infants and critically ill patients on ventilators, causes oxidative stress and lung injury [107]. Thus, increased ROS production has been directly linked to inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and ARDS. ROS are essential for normal lung/endothelial function [108] , but an imbalance of the redox equilibrium may contribute to pulmonary edema [109, 110] . The imbalance of oxidants produced to oxidants detoxified, i.e., a change in the redox equilibrium appears important in the development of various inflammatory lung diseases, and increased ROS production have been directly linked to oxidation of DNA, proteins, lipids and sugars, remodeling of ECM, alteration of mitochondrial respiration, and apoptosis. Furthermore, increased levels of ROS have been implicated in initiating signaling cascades of activation of transcription factors (NF-kB and AP-1), chromatin remodeling, and gene expression of proinflammatory mediators [106, 111] . Also, ROS generated by phagocytes that have been recruited to sites of inflammation and excess generation of ROS by vascular cells are a major cause of edema and lung injury.

Prior to the last decade, permeability-reducing strategies primarily consisted of cyclic AMP (cAMP) augmentation, producing only modest barrier enhancement [153] [154] [155] [156] . More recently, a number of barrier-promoting agents have been identified which share common signal transduction mechanisms which are distinct from cAMP signals and target the endothelial actin cytoskeleton to facilitate barrier-restorative processes. The dynamic process of actin polymerization allows for the rapid reorganization of actin structures, with profound functional consequences for barrier regulation that are highly dependent on the exact spatial location of this actin rearrangement occurring as either barrier-disrupting cytosolic stress fibers or as a barrier-enhancing thickened cortical actin ring. We have demonstrated that the quiescent EC phenotype is characterized by a cortical actin ring and few stress fibers, a structure which favors cell-cell adhesion and cell-matrix tethering. We have conceptualized a paradigm whereby barrier recovery after edemagenic agonists involves development of a cortical actin ring to anchor cellular junctions and a carefully choreographed (but poorly understood) gap-closing process via formation of Rac GTPase-dependent lamellipodial protrusions into the paracellular space between activated ECs (Fig. 3 ) Within these lamellipodia, signals are transduced to actin-binding proteins (nmMLCK and cortactin) and phosphorylated MLCs in spatial-specific cellular locations. Lamellipodia also require formation of focal adhesions (regulated by the cytoskeleton) critical to the establishment of the linkage of the actin cytoskeleton to target effectors that restore cell-cell adhesion and cell-matrix adhesion. This process is essential to the restoration of endothelial barrier in response to exposure to agonists such as sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), simvastatin, activated protein C (APC), ATP, oxidized phopholipids, and hyaluaron [33, 134, [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] . Central to these events is the activation of small GTPases, Rac and cdc42 [162] , which follows ligation of barrier-protective receptors and drives cortical actin remodeling and lamellipodia formation (Fig. 3 ). In addition to lamellipodia, there is increased actin polymerization at the cell periphery (i.e., the cortical actin ring) which occurs with increased force driven by the actin-binding proteins cortactin and nmMLCK, which also translocate to this spatially defined region. Like lamellipodia formation, Rac GTPase-dependent increases in the level of cortical actin follow exposure to multiple barrier-enhancing levels of SS or to potent barrier-enhancing agonists [134, 158, 159] , including S1P [157, 158] , HGF [33], ATP [159] , simvastatin [158] , APC [134] , prostaglandin E 2 [163] , and oxidized phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphochlorine (OxPAPC) [160] (Table 1 ). These observations serve to highlight the importance of the cellular location of cytoskeletal proteins in maintaining or enhancing EC barrier function, with cortactin directly interacting with nmMLCK, an association which is increased by p60 src tyrosine phosphorylation of either cortactin or nmMLCK [26] . Rac activation is in conjunction with Akt-mediated phosphorylation events known to be involved in EC proliferation and migration [164] and EC barrier enhancement.

S1P ligates a family of receptors known as S1P receptors (also termed endothelial differentiation gene or Edg receptors) with prominent effects on the vasculature, promoting EC mitogenesis, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis. Our earlier studies were the first to demonstrate that S1P is the most potent EC chemoattractant in serum [171] and to link S1P and its receptor ligation to enhanced vascular barrier regulation and demonstrated that physiological doses of S1P induce EC activation, marked cytoskeletal rearrangement, and stabilization of lung EC barrier function in vitro [157] . This novel function for S1P was of particular relevance to clinical medicine as thrombocytopenia is well known to be associated with increased vascular leak [172] and although the mechanism of this effect was unknown, we demonstrated that activated platelets are an important source of S1P and directly enhance barrier function via S1P 1 receptor ligation [173] . Platelets contain significant levels of sphingosine kinase but reduced levels of sphingosine lyase, thereby serving as enriched sources for the barrier-promoting S1P [173] . Ligation by S1P of the barrier-enhancing G i -protein-coupled S1P 1 receptor (also known as Edg1) [157, 170, 174, 175] increases Rac GTPase activity [157] , cytosolic calcium level [176] , and aggregation of key barrier-regulatory signaling components into caveolin-rich lipid rafts, including the Rac GTPase target p21-associated Ser/Thr kinase (PAK) and its downstream target cofilin, an actin-binding protein [177] , nmMLCK, cortactin, and c-Abl. PAK and cofilin allow polymerization-depolymerization cycling to occur and thus facilitate rearrangement of actin from primarily transcytoplasmic to primarily cortical in a spatially distinct organization as a cortical actin cellular ring, processes which are integral to EC barrier function [157] . Increases in MLC phosphorylation within a peripheral distribution within the cortical actin ring [157] provide strength to this spatially directed scaffolding force and enhance cell-cell tethering as we described via atomic force microscopy [178] . Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that overexpressed green fluorescent protein-nmMLCK distributes along cytoplasmic actin fibers, but rapidly translocates to the cortical regions of the cell after S1P treatment, rapidly catalyzing MLC phosphorylation. In addition, confocal microscopy studies showed ECs challenged with S1P demonstrate colocalization of nmMLCK with the key actin-binding and EC barrierregulatory protein cortactin [158] . The interaction of cortactin and nmMLCK decreases cortactin-stimulated actin polymerization [26, 158] and is essential to S1P barrier protection. The p60 src is not involved in this pathway, but other tyrosine kinases such as c-abl are likely involved [158] . S1P-induced cytoskeletal rearrangement produces increased linkage of actin to AJ components, as well as S1P-induced phosphorylation of focal-adhesion-related proteins paxillin and FAK, with translocation of these proteins to the EC periphery, further implicating S1Pinduced cell-cell adhesive changes as part of the mechanism of S1P-induced barrier enhancement [176, 179] . The potential utility of S1P in restoring lung water balance in patients with inflammatory injury was underscored in studies involving small-and large-animal models of ALI in which S1P provided dramatic attenuation of LPS-mediated lung inflammation and permeability [170, 180] . Mice treated with S1P had significantly less histological evidence of inflammatory changes/lung injury, with decreased neutrophil alveolitis on BAL and decreased lung MPO activity [180] . Interestingly, mice treated with S1P after intratracheal administration of LPS also showed an attenuated renal inflammatory response compared with controls, measured by tissue MPO activity and Evans blue dye extravasation as a measure of capillary leak. S1P also protected against intrabronchial LPS-induced ALI and concomitant VILI in a canine model, with decreased shunt fraction, decreased BAL protein, decreased extravascular lung water, and improved oxygenation [181] . Use of a large-animal canine model allowed investigation of regional lung changes in ALI and the effect of S1P on these changes. Computed tomography scans of animals subjected to LPS/VILI found that animals treated with S1P had a dramatic improvement in alveolar air content (with decreased edema) in all lung regions [181] .

S1P also causes bradycardia via ligation of cardiac S1P 3 receptor [183] . These findings generated increased interest in FTY720, a derivative of the natural immunosuppressant myriocin [184] , and a recently described immunosuppressive agent that causes peripheral lymphopenia by inhibiting cellular egress from lymphoid tissues. FTY720 is structurally similar (but not identical) to S1P and is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase to FTY720-phosphate, which is an agonist at S1P receptors [184] . This characteristic prompted investigation of the effect of FTY720 on EC barrier function. FTY720 did not have superior efficacy compared with mycophenolate mofetil in preventing renal transplant rejection [185] , but it is in phase III clinical trials as an immunosuppressant in multiple sclerosis patients. The clinical availability of FTY720 makes it attractive as a potential mediator of EC barrier function in patients with ALI. Our in vivo studies demonstrated that intraperitoneally administered FTY720 protected against intratracheally administered LPS in a murine model of ALI, as measured by Evans blue dye extravasation [180] . The mechanism of FTY720-induced EC barrier enhancement diverges from the mechanism described for S1P in several ways, including the delayed kinetics of the rise in total energy requirement (TER) compared with S1P [186] . Decreased expression of the S1P1 receptor prevented an S1P-induced increase in TER but only partially altered FTY720-induced TER increases. Unlike S1P, FTY720 did not result in threonine phosphorylation of the S1P1 receptor, nor did inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-kinase) prevent FTY720-induced EC barrier enhancement [186] . Furthermore, FTY720 did not cause the increased intracellular calcium level, the MLC phosphorylation, or the cytoskeletal rearrangement seen in response to S1P [186] . Downregulation of Rac or cortactin using siRNAs attenuated the barrier-enhancing effect of S1P, but not that of FTY720 [186] . Although FTY720 is an S1P receptor agonist, its mechanism of barrier enhancement is distinct from that of S1P and does not require the S1P 1 receptor.

These chemokines are all produced by human alveolar macrophages and contain a glutamylleucyl-arginine (ELR) motif that is critical to their neutrophil binding and chemotactic functions [221] . IL-8 is present in biologically significant concentrations in BAL fluid from patients with ARDS, tracking PMN concentrations [222] . Although GRO-a and ENA-78 concentrations are higher than IL-8 concentrations, IL-8 is the predominant chemoattractant in ARDS BAL fluid via its high-affinity binding to CXC chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, on human PMNs. Unlike ENA-78, GRO-a, GRO-b, and GRO-g with a high-affinity binding only to CXCR2, IL-8 and GCP-2 can bind to either receptor with high affinity [223] . In the presence of a systemic inflammatory process such as severe sepsis, CXCR2 is tonically downregulated and the function of only CXCR1 receptor predominates [224] . Thus, of the multiple neutrophil chemotactic factors produced in humans, there appears to be a small group that is particularly relevant to patients with ARDS, with IL-8 and its cognate receptor CXCR1 being the dominant receptor-ligand pair. IL-8 also binds to its circulating high-affinity polyclonal IgG3 and IgG4 autoantibodies naturally [225] , therefore preventing binding to CXC chemokine receptors on PMNs [226] . These autoantibodies are present in lung fluids from patients who are at-risk for ARDS as well as in patients after the onset of ARDS. The ratio of IL-8 autoantibody:cytokine complex was significantly higher at the onset of ARDS than in patients at risk for ARDS. In addition, patients with ARDS with an elevated anti-IL-8-autoantibody:IL-8 complex ratio are more likely to die than patients with lower concentrations of anti-IL-8-autoantibody:IL-8 complex [227] . Thus, the anti-IL-8-autoantibody:IL-8 complex ratio in lung fluid samples was more revealing than lung fluid protein concentrations to predict the development of ARDS in patients who were at-risk, and also for predicting mortality in patients with ARDS [228] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 384, "end": 389, "text": "[221]", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 517, "end": 522, "text": "[222]", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 896, "end": 901, "text": "[223]", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1069, "text": "[224]", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1418, "text": "[225]", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 1485, "end": 1490, "text": "[226]", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1955, "text": "[227]", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 2211, "end": 2216, "text": "[228]", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IL-8/IL-8 Receptor"}, {"text": "The protein C pathway is one of the most important regulators of blood coagulation and serves as a critical link between coagulation and inflammation in sepsis and ALI [229] [230] [231] . Protein C is a vitamin-K-dependent plasma glycoprotein that is synthesized by the liver and circulates as a two-chain biologically inactive zymogen. It is transformed to its active form, APC, by the thrombomodulin-thrombin complex on the cell surface. APC suppresses further thrombin formation by proteolytically inactivating coagulation factors Va and VIIIa [232] . The membrane-bound EPCR potentiates this activation about 20-fold [233] . Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to its anticoagulant effects, APC also has anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, the protein C pathway is important for the control and modulation of both coagulation and inflammation [230] . APC inhibits the production of TNF-a via NFkB activation in monocytes and ECs [234] , and inhibits neutrophil activation and chemotaxis through interaction with a cell-surface receptor similar to the EPCR [235] . Decreased protein C activation on the pulmonary vascular endothelium surface may contribute to the widespread microvascular thrombosis that occurs in the acutely injured lung and may also be proinflammatory and proapoptotic. Administration of APC attenuates experimental sepsis-induced lung injury. In human studies, an infusion of APC 2 h prior to and 6 h after administration of an intravenous injection of LPS prevented LPS-induced increase in tissue factor expression and thrombin formation in plasma after LPS injection, as well as circulating levels of IL-6 or TNF-a, markers of inflammation [236] . Loss of thrombomodulin and EPCR from the cell surface results in a decreased ability to activate protein C, a phenomenon that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis and lung injury. Release of the protein C pathway components throm-bomodulin and EPCR into the plasma has been reported in experimental sepsis models [237] . In clinical studies, plasma protein C levels were reduced in patients with severe sepsis, with 90% of patients meeting the criteria for acquired protein C deficiency. Low levels of protein C were associated with ventilator dependency and a higher prevalence of ARDS and correlated with higher mortality [238] . Another study demonstrated that patients with severe sepsis varied markedly in their ability to generate APC [239] . Modulation of coagulation and inflammation through the activation of protein C is a critical mechanism in the pathogenesis of sepsis and ALI [231] . Protein C levels and thrombomodulin levels are lower early in the course of ALI and reduced plasma protein C and thrombomodulin levels are associated with higher mortality and more nonpulmonary organ system dysfunction, with the combination of low levels of protein C and other predictors such as high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) conferring an even higher risk of mortality. The prognostic value of protein C and thrombomodulin was not altered by exclusion of patients with coexisting sepsis [229] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 173, "text": "[229]", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 174, "end": 179, "text": "[230]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 180, "end": 185, "text": "[231]", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 547, "end": 552, "text": "[232]", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 621, "end": 626, "text": "[233]", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 854, "end": 859, "text": "[230]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 940, "end": 945, "text": "[234]", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1072, "text": "[235]", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 1673, "end": 1678, "text": "[236]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2007, "end": 2012, "text": "[237]", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 2318, "end": 2323, "text": "[238]", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 2435, "end": 2440, "text": "[239]", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 2584, "end": 2589, "text": "[231]", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 3108, "end": 3113, "text": "[229]", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Protein C / Thrombomodulin"}, {"text": "The balance between activation of coagulation and activation of fibrinolysis is likely an important determinant of the amount and duration of fibrin deposition in the injured lung, and the fibrinolytic system is profoundly altered in patients with ALI/ARDS, both systemically and in the alveolar compartment. Plasminogen activator (PA) and PAI-1 regulate fibrinolysis, the dissolution of fibrin clots, through modulation of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, a major fibrinolytic enzyme [240] . Upregulation of PAI-1, the major inhibitor of fibrinolysis, appears to play a primary role in the shift from profibrinolytic to antifibrinolytic phenotypes in a variety of cell types, including ECs, indicating a risk factor for ALI and sepsis. There are two forms of PA, urokinase-type PA (uPA) and tissue-type PA (tPA). uPA is a cell-surface protein that is responsible for activating fibrinolysis at the tissue level, whereas tPA is a soluble protein that activates intravascular fibrinolysis [241] . Two major endogenous PA inhibitors have been identified, PAI-1 and PAI-2, which are produced by platelets, endothelial, mesothelial, and epithelial cells, including those of the lung [241] . PAI-1 is the major PA inhibitor in plasma and extravascular fluids and has been implicated in the fibrinolytic defect associated with ALI [242] . Human lung ECs isolated from patients with ARDS constitutively express greater levels of PAI-1 than controls with lower fibrinolytic potential as measured by the PA to PAI-1 ratio. In limited ALI/ARDS clinical studies, reduced fibrinolytic capacity and an increase in uPA and in PAI-1 activity was noted in ARDS patents, with levels of PAI-1 higher in both pulmonary edema fluid and plasma of ALI/ARDS patients, and correlated with mortality in patients with ALI/ ARDS [243, 244] .

This gene encodes for a proinflammatory cytokine, originally described for its role in the maturation of B-cell precursors, with gene expression upregulated in amniotic membranes from patients undergoing premature labor, especially with amniotic infections. PBEF protein levels were significantly increased in both BAL fluid and serum of human, murine, and canine ALI models as well as in cytokine-or CS-activated lung microvascular endothelium [131, 136] . Triple immunohistochemical staining of canine lungs revealed colocalization of increased PBEF expression in lung endothelium, type II alveolar epithelial cells, and infiltrating neutrophils, as well as upregulation of PBEF expression in inflammatory cytokine-stimulated human pulmonary microvascular ECs in vitro [131] . These results support PBEF as a potential biomarker in ALI and potentially involved in inflammatory lung processes, a notion supported by recent studies in patients with sepsis which convincingly demonstrate that PBEF inhibits neutrophil apoptosis [131, 136] . Common variants in the human PBEF gene are also confirmed to be associated with susceptibility to sepsis-associated ALI [263] . The T allele in the C-1543T single-nucleotide polymorphism in the PBEF promoter region was associated with a nearly twofold decrease in the reporter gene expression.

In addition, several endothelial target proteins or protein pathway participants also serve as potentially novel biomarkers in the management of these patients. The newly revised scientific armamentarium offers promise for the future management of pulmonary edema associated with increased vascular leak in the critically ill as well as other lung conditions which exhibit strongly dysregulated barrier function such as radiation pneumonitis, acute chest syndrome in sickle cell patients, and in subacute inflammatory disorders such as asthma. Nearly each barrier-regulatory agent discussed herein has been successfully evaluated in preclinical models of ALI and one agent, FTY720, is in phase III trials, whereas three agents, statins, APC and MNTX, are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for other medical conditions. Thus, the prospects for the rapid translation of these lung vascular barrier-protective strategies to clinical practice are high.

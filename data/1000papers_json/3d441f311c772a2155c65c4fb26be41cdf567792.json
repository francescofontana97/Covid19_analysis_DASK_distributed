Patients with psychiatric disorders are a vulnerable risk population for worsening of their condition and relapse of symptoms. This study investigates the pandemic-related course of psychosocial burden in patients with pre-existing mental disorders. With the newly developed Goettingen psychosocial Burden and Symptom Inventory (Goe-BSI) psychosocial burden has been traced retrospectively (1) before the pandemic (beginning of 2020), (2) at its beginning under maximum lockdown conditions (March 2020), and (3) for the current state after maximum lockdown conditions (April/May 2020). The Goe-BSI also integrates the Adjustment Disorder New Module (ADNM-20), assesses general psychiatric symptoms, and resilience. A total of 213 patients covering all major psychiatric disorders (ICD-10 F0-F9) were interviewed once in the time range from April, 24th until May 11th, 2020. Across all diagnoses patients exhibited a distinct pattern with an initial rise followed by a decline of psychosocial burden (p < 0.001, partial \u03b7 2 = 0.09; Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons between all three time-points: p < 0.05 to 0.001). Female gender and high ADNM-20 scores were identified as risk factors for higher levels and an unfavorable course of psychosocial burden over time. Most psychiatric symptoms remained unchanged. Trajectories of psychosocial burden vary in parallel to local lockdown restrictions and seem to reflect an adaptive stress response. For female patients with pre-existing mental disorders and patients with high-stress responses, timely and specific treatment should be scheduled. With the continuation of the pandemic, monitoring of long-term effects is of major importance, especially when long incubation times for the development of mental health issues are considered.",

Second, the other study specifically devoted to patients with eating disorders in Spain found an increase in symptomatology and additional anxiety symptoms [22] . A recent study targeting the general population in Italy suggested a higher risk for developing severe depression and anxiety symptoms in respondents of an online survey with a self-reported history of mental health problems [23] . Similarly, higher levels of anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were found in 76 patients compared to healthy controls during strict lockdown measures in China, and high rates of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms [24] . Yet, this patient sample was restricted to unipolar depression (F32, F33) and a small range of anxiety disorders (F41, F41.8).",

Along the same line with an adaptation response to lockdown restrictions and shown by data from the general population, anxiety and/or depression levels declined during the first weeks of lockdown in UK [36, 37] , even if initially increased in a very early phase of the pandemic [36] . Similar results from the Swiss Corona Stress Study also showed a decrease of anxiety levels (late April 2020 to May/June 2020) [38] . The COSMO study allows for comparisons with data from the German population before the outbreak of the pandemic. In contrast, this study found slightly increased psychological distress (anxiety and depression) but was confined to the first weeks of lockdown in Germany (late March to early April 2020, as published so far [7] ). Another German study with population-based pre-pandemic reference data did not identify general differences in mental health conditions according to the WHO-5 well-being index and PHQ-D between 2018 and 2020 (late April to late May) [39] . Compared to these longitudinal data from the general population, patients with current psychiatric conditions in the present study showed higher baseline levels of symptoms before the pandemic but seemed to experience a stress response very similar to that of general population samples:",

In this matter, subsample analyses of a quota survey in UK isolated 27.2% of participants with self-reported, pre-existing psychiatric disorders showing initial higher levels of depression and anxiety, a lower well-being and a reduction of depressive symptoms from late March to early May 2020 [37] . However, longitudinal reference data from populations with current psychiatric disorders are hardly available so far. At first glance, a course of psychosocial burden indicative of a normal stress response and only an increase in a minority of psychiatric symptoms in this particularly vulnerable population seems encouraging. One reason might be that patients show an adaptive stress response and employ resilience strategies to protect their individual well-being. However, despite generally elevated ADNM-20 sum scores in this population, one must consider that Germany showed moderate SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates compared to other countries. Even in the early months of the rising pandemic, the German healthcare system withstood the pandemic challenge in spring 2020 without collapsing. Also, only moderate restrictions were enacted in Germany compared to many other countries. Additionally, one might speculate that some patients even took advantage from their pre-existing low levels of functioning. Social withdrawal and isolation together with reduced leisure activities are common features of many psychiatric disorders, and such patients may have already been used to social deprivation. Furthermore, avoidance behavior and home confinement were legitimated by governmental regulations and may have contributed to the observed reduction in psychosocial burden. Treatment continuation, as realized via service hotlines, emergency contacts and early implementation of telepsychiatric services, might have also contributed to the rather small, partial and temporary impact on the psychosocial burden of the psychiatric population studied here.",

Being female has previously been identified as a risk factor for higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress [7, 14, 23, [36] [37] [38] . Furthermore, our finding of a higher psychosocial burden in female patients was paralleled by elevated sum scores of the ADNM-20. Irrespective of gender, the ADNM-20 provided good discriminant validity and allowed to detect patients at risk for unfavorable trajectories of psychosocial burden. Importantly, 39% of the present patient sample were indicative of adjustment disorder compared to 44% of first-onset adjustment disorder in Covid-19 patients in China [40] and 16% in Iran [31] .",

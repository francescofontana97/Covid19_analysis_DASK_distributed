Different subsets carry out different functions and have been previously associated with multiple inflammatory conditions. Dissecting the contribution of different monocyte subsets to disease is currently limited by samples and cohorts, often resulting in underpowered studies and poor reproducibility. Publicly available transcriptome profiles provide an alternative source of data characterized by high statistical power and real-world heterogeneity. However, most transcriptome datasets profile bulk blood or tissue samples, requiring the use of in silico approaches to quantify changes in cell levels.",

These signatures maintain their accuracy regardless of disease state in an independent cohort profiled by RNA-sequencing and are specific to their respective subset when compared to other immune cells from both myeloid and lymphoid lineages profiled across 6160 transcriptome profiles. Consequently, we show that these signatures can be used to quantify changes in monocyte subsets levels in expression profiles from patients in clinical trials. Finally, we show that proteins encoded by our signature genes can be used in cytometry-based assays to specifically sort monocyte subsets. Our results demonstrate the robustness, versatility, and utility of our computational approach and provide a framework for the discovery of new cellular markers.",

            "text": "Monocytes, together with macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), are part of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Monocytes and monocyte-derived cells play important roles in the regulation of inflammation, both as precursors as well as effector cells (1) (2) (3) . Monocytes are a heterogeneous group of cells, and since Passlick and colleagues showed that the combined use of CD16 (FcgRIII) and the LPS co-receptor CD14 identified distinct subsets of monocytes in humans (4), three major subsets have been defined, as well as their murine counterparts. These subsets are: a classical (CD14 + CD16in humans and Ly6C hi in mice), a nonclassical (CD14 -CD16 + in humans and Ly6C lo in mice), and an intermediate subset (CD14 + CD16 + in humans and Ly6C + Treml4 + in mice) (5) (6) (7) . Although plasticity is an important characteristic of monocytes (8, 9) , surface marker expression and functional studies have shown each monocyte subset to be functionally distinct. Consistent with this, transcriptome analyses of sorted monocyte subsets have revealed different gene expression profiles ascribed to each subset (7, 10, 11) . Classical monocytes, around 90% of total monocytes in humans, are efficient phagocytic cells important for the initiation of inflammatory response, with high expression of scavenger and chemokine receptors, and elevated cytokine production (12, 13) . Earlier work on nonclassical monocytes, around 5% of total monocytes, emphasized their capacity to produce inflammatory cytokines, especially TNF (14) . However, recent work has shown that nonclassical monocytes are also involved in immune surveillance of the vasculature and have pro-and antiinflammatory functions (9, 15) . Intermediate monocytes are considered efficient antigen presenting cells (12) . Consequently, altered frequencies of different subsets have been associated with inflammatory conditions, such as infections and autoimmune disorders including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (13, (16) (17) (18) (19) , and more recently, COVID-19 (20, 21) .",

These signatures, although derived using only datasets profiling healthy individuals, maintain their accuracy independent of the disease state in an independent cohort profiled by RNA-sequencing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these signatures are specific to monocyte subsets compared to other immune cells such as B, T, dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells. This increased specificity results in estimated monocyte subset levels that are strongly correlated with cytometry-based quantification of cellular subsets. Consequently, we show that these monocyte subsetspecific signatures can be used to quantify changes in monocyte subsets levels in expression profiles from patients in clinical trials. Finally, we show that proteins encoded by our signature genes can be used in cytometry-based assays to specifically sort monocyte subsets. Our results demonstrate the robustness, versatility, and utility of our computational approach and provide a framework for the discovery of new cellular markers.",

We normalized each expression dataset using quantile normalization and computed gene-level expression from probelevel data using the original probe annotation files available from GEO as described previously (31) . We performed conormalization, effect size calculation, and gene ranking as previously described (31) . We performed gene set selection to identify parsimonious gene signatures using the following criteria: (a) we ranked genes based on effect size (b) we filtered genes that were up-regulated in the cell subset of interest (c) we filtered genes with a mean expression difference of 32 expression units or above (d) We selected the top 10 genes for each subset. We chose these criteria to increase the likelihood of successful independent experimental validation of each marker gene. Signature scores were computed by calculating the geometric mean of expression levels of the signature genes in the dataset of interest, as described previously (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) .

            "text": "We hypothesized that integrating heterogeneous transcriptome profiles of sorted human monocyte subsets across multiple cohorts would allow us to identify robust subset-specific gene expression signatures. To test this hypothesis, we collected and annotated 853 publicly available gene expression profiles of sorted human monocytes across 45 studies. These datasets spanned 22 microarray platforms for transcriptome profiling of samples acquired from healthy donors (Supplemental Table 1 ). After sample annotation, we co-normalized and integrated all expression data as previously described (31) (Figure 1 ). For each gene, we calculated effect sizes as Hedge's g between the samples from a cell subset of interest compared to all other samples. We then characterized the underlying biological functions represented within the transcriptional data for each monocyte subset by performing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (see Methods). We identified 91 significantly enriched pathways in classical monocytes and 1737 for the nonclassical subset (FDR < 5%). Our analysis revealed pathways associated with known functions of classical monocytes, such as wound healing, cytoskeleton remodeling, and phagocytosis, positively enriched in the classical subset (Supplemental Table 2 ). In contrast, our analysis of the nonclassical subset revealed categories of diseaseassociated gene expression changes, cell cycle, and metabolism (Supplemental Table 3 ). Notably, our most significant enrichment consisted of a gene signature previously reported to be down-regulated in Alzheimer's Disease (pathway: 'BLALOCK_ALZHEIMERS_DISEASE_DN', p = 9.9e-6). This is in agreement with previous reports showing that nonclassical monocytes are found to be reduced in patients affected by Alzheimer's (40) . These results suggest that our data integration strategy allowed us to preserve and capture previously described biological functions of monocyte subsets irrespective of technical and biological confounders within our collection of datasets. We then applied our multi-cohort analysis framework to identify robust cell-subset specific genes (see Methods) (23, 31, 41) . We considered classical and nonclassical monocyte subsets for our analysis because of their functional importance and the number of available datasets for each subset that could be integrated into our analysis (n>=4). There were 30 genes significantly over-expressed in classical monocytes and 268 genes over-expressed in nonclassical monocytes. We created classical and nonclassical monocyte specific gene signatures using the top 10 genes for each monocyte subset that were consistently elevated within the subset of interest across all our discovery cohorts ( Figures  2A, B and Supplemental Table 4 ). Among the classical signature genes, five have been previously associated with the classical monocytes in a single-cell RNA-seq study of healthy FIGURE 1 | Generation of monocyte-specific signatures: Workflow depicting collection and annotation of publicly available discovery datasets from NCBI GEO profiling sorted human monocyte cell subsets (classical and non classical). Data was the combined and co-normalized to identify subset-specific signatures. Signatures were validated on a independent RNA-seq chohort, and on PBMCs expression profiles with paired flow data. After validation, signatures were applied on disease-affected cohorts and tested for their viability as phenotypic markers in cytometry-based assays. monocytes, and SIGLEC10 was identified in non-classical monocytes as well (42) .",

Therefore, we investigated whether these monocyte subset-specific signatures are confounded by disease state in an independent cohort of healthy controls (n=3) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; n=3).

All genes except two from the non-classical monocyte signature, (IER2 and CTSA), were correctly over-expressed in their respective subset, and most (15 of 20) were independently confirmed by RT-PCR in sorted monocytes from healthy controls and patients with RA (Supplemental Figure 1 ).

This is important, as their direct application to blood or biopsy-derived expression profiles, which contain multiple and diverse cell populations, would otherwise produce confounded results (43) . To answer this question, we compared effect sizes for each gene in our monocyte subset signatures across 20 sorted human immune cell types using 6160 transcriptomes from across 42 different microarray platforms described before (31) . Hierarchical clustering of Hedge's g effect sizes (see Methods) of the genes in monocyte subset-specific signatures distinguished myeloid and lymphoid lineages (Supplemental Figure 3) . Further, within the myeloid cluster, both CD14+ and CD16+ subsets clustered separately from other myeloid cells (Supplemental Figure 3 ). Next, we calculated cMSS and ncMSS scores for each sample and evaluated their ability to accurately distinguish each subset among all immune cells. As expected, cMSS scores were significantly higher in classical monocytes compared to nonclassical monocytes (t-test p=1.2e-7) and other immune cell types (t-test p<2.2e-16, Figure 4A ). Similarly, ncMSS were significantly higher in nonclassical monocytes compared to classical monocytes (t-test p=4.6e-9) and other immune cell types (t-test p<2.2e-16, Figure 4B ). ",

Finally, we assessed whether our signatures could detect changes in cellular composition induced by treatment. To this end, we analyzed a longitudinal dataset, GSE80060, profiling whole blood samples of patients affected by sJIA before and after treatment with canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-1 beta. Changes in levels of circulating monocytes in sJIA have been described, with higher levels during active disease (46, 47) .

Our analysis presented here builds upon an existing framework that was previously applied to create a new and unbiased basis matrix for cell-mixture deconvolution of gene expression data. By applying this computational framework that integrates existing heterogeneous public expression data from sorted human monocytes, we identified gene signatures for the classical and nonclassical subsets, each consisting of ten over-expressed genes. We then validated our signatures using transcriptome profiles of 6661 sorted immune cell samples across 168 studies, including samples from patients with various diseases to demonstrate their generalizability despite biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity. In addition, we profiled two independent validation cohorts by RNA-seq and flow-cytometry, respectively, to validate our signatures at the individual gene level. Our current work differs from previous efforts in several meaningful ways: First, our previous work on deconvolution aimed at building a basis matrix, immunoStates, that would account for 20 immune cell types. As a result, immunoStates is composed of more than 300 genes, and is applied in its entirety to deconvolve a sample of interest. Other studies, such as the one by Monaco et al. (36) , established deconvolution approaches to quantify different cell types with high accuracy, as they rely on larger gene sets and statistical approaches tailored toward a specific data type or platform (e.g., RNA-seq).",

Such strategies take into account the directionality of the markers and their expression difference, to increase the likelihood of validation by flow-cytometry. Indeed, a number of genes in our signatures correspond to surface markers with commercially available antibodies. Using this set of markers, we confirmed the subset specificity of the markers in both healthy and disease samples at the protein level. Among the markers identified and validated by flow cytometry, only CD16 and CD36, in addition to CD14 and HLA-DR, have been commonly used to identify monocyte subsets (49, 50) . The additional markers we identified could thus be potentially useful in further probing the heterogeneity of monocyte subsets, as revealed by recent studies utilizing the high dimensionality of mass cytometry and single cell sequencing to tease out the heterogeneity of the human monocyte population (42, 43, 51) .",

Our rationale for this decision was based on having on average 22 studies per targeted cell type in our discovery set, which triples both the statistical power and the amount of accounted heterogeneity in this study compared to our previous work [8 studies per cell type, (31) ]. We hypothesized these increases would result in more robust signatures, and our validation cohort validated our signatures irrespective of disease state. Analysis of our cohort also revealed that the expression levels of our signature scores in intermediate monocytes were intermediate between the classical and non-classical subsets. It has long been debated whether intermediate monocytes exist as a stable subset or represent a transitional state between classical and non-classical monocytes (52) . Another alternative, not necessarily mutually exclusive, is that intermediate monocytes may comprise a heterogeneous cell mix (42, 53) . Our results are consistent with evidence that human intermediate monocytes, like similar cells in mice (54) are an intermediate, transitory subset between classical and non-classical monocytes rather than a fixed, independent population (55) . To test this hypothesis, we generated an additional expression signature from our discovery data, identifying genes that could specifically distinguish intermediate monocytes compared to all other subsets. Using the same criteria applied for the other signatures, we identified 10 genes that accurately distinguished intermediate monocytes from all other subsets (ATG2A, ATP50, DX39A, EVL, GPR183, LPCAT1, POU2F2, TSC22D4, ZNF14, ARHGAP27, Supplemental Figure 6 ). Unlike our previous signatures, we did not observe a good distinction of intermediate monocyte samples, neither in our own discovery set, nor in our validation cohort. Similarly, although gene expression analysis, both from microarray as well as from single cell RNA-seq analysis, generally support the concept of genetically separate three monocyte subsets, the exact nature of the intermediate subset, and its relationship to other monocyte subsets, could not be fully determined (56) .",

This is particularly relevant in the context of intermediate monocytes. For example, HLA-DM has been identified as a strong discriminating marker that separates the intermediate subset from classical and non-classical (37) . However, this marker is not usually profiled on microarrays, limiting our discovery potential. Secondly, we identified our signature genes by simply selecting the top 10 from a ranked list. While this approach is simple and intuitive, it prevents the consideration of other high-ranking genes as potential biomarkers. This potential can be explored in future work, where additional gene set selection strategies can be applied to this data.",

To this date, highthroughput proteomics data is limited by technical constraints on the number of protein markers that can be simultaneously profiled on a single sample. Advances in mass-cytometry based techniques can in principle extend our ability to profile multiple markers expressed in a single-cell (58) , as well as proteomics (59) , but at scales substantially lower than transcriptomics-based assays.

Samples are labeled by cell type and disease state. (B) Bee-swarm plots displaying classical monocyte signature (cMSS) scores across monocyte subsets and disease condition. Significance was computed by t-test. (C) Same as (B) for non-classical monocyte subset signature (ncMSS) scores. 3B, C). Both scores identified their respective monocyte subset with high accuracy irrespective of the disease state of the sample (AUROC=1; Supplemental Figure 2), although IER2 and CTSA were expressed in opposite directions. Importantly, cMSS and ncMSS for intermediate monocytes possessed scores between those of classical and non-classical monocytes (cMSS: intermediate vs classical p-value = 7.4e-4; intermediate vs non-classical p-value = 3.4e-4) (ncMSS: intermediate vs classical p-value = 1.5e-3; intermediate vs non-classical p-value = 9.9e-3)",

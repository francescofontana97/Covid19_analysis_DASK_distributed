For diagnosis, nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were collected and tested using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On admission, all patients underwent routine blood tests and chest X-ray. Patients were discharged following resolution of symptoms, and negative RT-PCR results from two consecutive NP samples collected at \u226524-hour intervals. This study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee. Patient A1 (presumed asymptomatic carrier in household setting) is a 30-year-old man. On February 27, he traveled to Malaysia to attend the Tablighi event and returned to Brunei on March 3. Following detection of the country's first COVID-19 case and the subsequent identification of the Tablighi cluster, all participants of that event who returned to Brunei were tested. His NP sample taken on March 10 was positive by RT-PCR, and he was admitted to the National Isolation Centre. He was asymptomatic on admission and remained so throughout (Figure 1). His blood investigations and chest X-ray were normal. RT-PCR was still positive on March 24, and negative on March 26 and 27. All 7 household contacts were tested on March 12, out of which two were found positive. Patient A2 (wife, aged 32) and patient A3 (daughter, aged 10 months) denied any travel or other relevant contact history. Patient A2 reported rhinorrhea which began on March 9; however, this had resolved on presentation. She was asymptomatic throughout her admission. Patient A3 was observed by her mother to have a mild cough starting on March 11, and however was afebrile and had no symptoms on and throughout admission. Patient B1 (presumed asymptomatic carrier in school setting) is a 13-year-old girl. She is an asymptomatic household contact of her father, who was a participant at the same Tablighi event in Malaysia. Her father was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 on March 11, and as a contact, her NP sample was collected that same day. She tested positive and was admitted to NIC. She was asymptomatic on presentation and remained so throughout admission (Figure 1). Her blood investigations and chest X-ray were normal. RT-PCR was positive on March 27 and negative on March 29 and 30. Contact tracing for case B1 identified 29 school contacts, all of whom were tested. Among them, her class teacher (patient B2, 39-year-old female) tested positive on March 12. On admission on March 14, patient B2 reported a mild cough which resolved the next day and has had no further symptoms since.",

This is particularly important if we aim to \"find, isolate, test, and treat every case to break the chains of COVID transmission. Second, given the high proportion of asymptomatic individuals (models estimate 30%), our findings strengthen the argument for widespread testing at mass gatherings in areas of known community transmission. 10 These have the potential to become SSEs, and diagnostic delays can fuel exponential growth. 11 As countries begin to slowly relax restrictions from community \"lockdowns,\" widespread testing of participants at mass gatherings with consequent identification of asymptomatic carriers may allow for restrictions to be relaxed in a safe way. Our findings suggest that this large-scale testing is feasible when deployed reactively after a confirmed COVID-19 case is identified.

            "text": "This study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee.Patient A1 (presumed asymptomatic carrier in household setting) is a 30-year-old man. On February 27, he traveled to Malaysia to attend the Tablighi event and returned to Brunei on March 3. Following detection of the country's first COVID-19 case and the subsequent identification of the Tablighi cluster, all participants of that event who returned to Brunei were tested. His NP sample taken on March 10 was positive by RT-PCR, and he was admitted to the National Isolation Centre. He was asymptomatic on admission and remained so throughout (Figure 1). His blood investigations and chest X-ray were normal. RT-PCR was still positive on March 24, and negative on March 26 and 27. All 7 household contacts were tested on March 12, out of which two were found positive. Patient A2 (wife, aged 32) and patient A3 (daughter, aged 10 months) denied any travel or other relevant contact history. Patient A2 reported rhinorrhea which began on March 9; however, this had resolved on presentation. She was asymptomatic throughout her admission. Patient A3 was observed by her mother to have a mild cough starting on March 11, and however was afebrile and had no symptoms on and throughout admission. Patient B1 (presumed asymptomatic carrier in school setting) is a 13-year-old girl. She is an asymptomatic household contact of her father, who was a participant at the same Tablighi event in Malaysia. Her father was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 on March 11, and as a contact, her NP sample was collected that same day. She tested positive and was admitted to NIC. She was asymptomatic on presentation and remained so throughout admission (Figure 1). Her blood investigations and chest X-ray were normal. RT-PCR was positive on March 27 and negative on March 29 and 30. Contact tracing for case B1 identified 29 school contacts, all of whom were tested. Among them, her class teacher (patient B2, 39-year-old female) tested positive on March 12. On admission on March 14, patient B2 reported a mild cough which resolved the next day and has had no further symptoms since.",

Here, using HIV immunogens with defined valencies ranging from 1 to 60, we investigated the role of antigen valency during different phases of B cell responses in vivo. Highly multimerized immunogens preferentially rapidly activated cognate B cells, with little affinity discrimination. This led to strong early induction of the transcription factors IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) and Bcl6, driving both early extrafollicular plasma cell and germinal center responses, in a CD4 + T-cell-dependent manner, involving B cells with a broad range of affinities. Low-valency antigens induced smaller effector B cell responses, with preferential recruitment of high-affinity B cells. Thus, antigen valency has multifaceted effects on B cell responses and can dictate affinity thresholds and competitive landscapes for B cells in vivo, with implications for vaccine design.",

B cells may then migrate to extrafollicular areas to differentiate into short-lived plasma cells (PCs) or migrate deeper into the B cell follicles to differentiate into germinal center (GC) B cells in conjunction with GC-residing Tfh cells (Crotty, 2019) . B cell compete for Tfh help both early (Schwickert et al., 2011; Yeh et al., 2018) and in GCs (Allen et al., 2007; Schwickert et al., 2007; Victora et al., 2010) . In vitro B cell studies provide some insights into how valency could impact B cell activation and the ability of B cells to acquire Tfh cell help. Extensive multivalent display of protein antigen, hen egg lysozyme (HEL), on cell membranes ($10,000 copies per cell) or beads enhanced cognate B cell activation and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II presentation compared to the monomeric form of the same antigen (Batista et al., 2001; Neuberger, 1998, 2000) . Small chemical haptens are used as a different experimental approach. Haptens conjugated at high density on monomeric proteins create valency densities $20-fold greater than what can occur for protein epitopes and therefore create supraphysiological BCR ligation. Thus, it is unclear which lessons from hapten studies of valency are transferrable to understanding protein epitopes of pathogens.",

For both the hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus vaccines, the multivalent nature of the virus-like particles (VLPs) is seen as a key attribute of the success of those vaccine antigens (Mohsen et al., 2017; Szmuness et al., 1980) . Nanoparticle, VLP, and liposomal antigens are being extensively explored as vaccine candidates to a wide range of pathogens (Chackerian et al., 2008; Ingale et al., 2016; Jardine et al., 2013 Jardine et al., , 2015 Kanekiyo et al., 2019; Marcandalli et al., 2019; Martinez-Murillo et al., 2017; Moon et al., 2012) , including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Coleman et al., 2014) . In candidate vaccine studies, usually only a single valency is assessed, and the B cell immunological outcome measured is the magnitude of antibody titers. The effects of differing protein valencies on GC formation and the composition of the B cell response are largely unknown. A mechanistic understanding of how antigen valency affects B cells in vivo has been lacking. For example, does high valency selectively enhance antibody titers strictly by expanding PCs (Chan et al., 2009; Paus et al., 2006) ? Alterations of immunization kinetics (''slow delivery immunization'') alter the composition of the B cell response, which can result in substantial enhancement of GC recruitment of B cells with neutralization potential (Cirelli et al., 2019; Pauthner et al., 2017) . Do antigen valency changes also alter the composition of the responding antigen-specific B cell population? While each antigen is a unique scenario, broad approximation answers for these knowledge gaps would have substantial utility. eOD-GT (engineered outer domain germline-targeting) proteins are series of engineered protein immunogens with varying affinities for the inferred-germline form of the HIV broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) VRC01 and other VRC01-class bnAbs (Jardine et al., 2013 (Jardine et al., , 2016 . VRC01-class bnAbs are specific for the receptor binding site of HIV gp120 and include some of the most broadly reactive Abs of all HIV bnAbs (Huang et al., 2016; Sajadi et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2010 Zhou et al., , 2013 . While mice do not have VRC01-class B cells, humans have VRC01-class B cells in the naive B cell repertoire at a frequency of 1 in 300,000 B cells, possessing a range of affinities Jardine et al., 2016) . We previously established a VRC01-class mouse model based on human physiological precursor frequencies and affinities . In this model, transgenic VRC01 gHL B cells expressing heavy and light chains from germline-reverted VRC01 can be successfully primed and recruited into GCs, in the face of immunodominant off-target epitopes, using an eOD-GT 60-mer nanoparticle antigen (eOD-GT5 60-mer) . A more advanced eOD-GT 60-mer nanoparticle, eOD-GT8 60-mer, is currently in a clinical trial as a germline-targeting candidate HIV vaccine priming antigen (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT03547245).",

Whereas 4-mer, 8-mer, and 60mer constructs each induced substantial B cell activation in vivo, the 60-mer outperformed the 4-valent and 8-valent antigens for in vivo cell accumulation, early induction of the transcription factors Bcl6 and IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) and GC B cell and PC differentiation. Furthermore, valency altered the composition of the responding antigen-specific B cell population. Thus, the quantity and quality of B cell responses can be tuned by altering antigen valency, with important implications for vaccine design.",

Hence, we believe that studying VRC01 gHL B cell responses to eOD-GT5 immunogens in this mouse model has relevance for understanding human B cell responses to the clinical candidate eOD-GT8 60-mer. To examine roles of valency in immunogenicity, we designed a tetrameric form (eOD-GT5 4-mer) and an octameric form (eOD-GT5 8mer) of eOD-GT5 protein, in addition to monomer (1-mer) and 60-mer (Figures 1A and S1; Table S1 ).",

To assess if quantitative differences in antigen valency impact B cells during initial antigen recognition, VRC01 gHL B cells and nonspecific polyclonal B cells were cotransferred into B6 mice before subcutaneous immunization with eOD-GT5 immunogens, in the absence of adjuvant, allowing for assessment of direct effects of valency ( Figure 1B ). Intravital imaging of inguinal lymph node (iLN) was performed hours later (2-3.5 h) to determine whether VRC01 gHL B cells slowed relative to polyclonal B cells ( Figure 1B ), a hallmark of antigen recognition (Miller et al., 2002) . VRC01 gHL and polyclonal B cells moved at similar speed in unimmunized mice ( Figures 1C, S2A , and S2B; Video S1). Immunization with eOD-GT5 monomer or 4-mer had no effect on the motility of VRC01 gHL B cells ( Figure 1C , 1D, and S2A; Video S1). The higher valency antigens, particularly eOD-GT5 60-mer, reduced the average migration speed (Figure 1C and S2A ; Video S1) and caused 28% of VRC01 gHL B cells to stop ( Figure 1D and S2A; Video S1). As a negative control, an eOD-GT5 60-mer mutant lacking measurable affinity for VRC01 gHL (eOD-GT5-KO2) was used. eOD-GT5-KO2 60-mer had no effect on the motility of VRC01 gHL B cells (Figures 1C and 1D ; Video S1). Furthermore, none of the antigens impacted the motility of polyclonal B cells ( Figures S2B and S2C ), indicating that the migration arrest was driven by multivalent cognate BCR recognition.",

Unlike monomeric ll Article antigen, eOD-GT5 4-mer and 8-mer did activate VRC01 gHL B cells ( Figure 1E-1H ). Strong activation of VRC01 gHL B cells encountering eOD-GT5 60-mer was apparent ( Figures 1E-1H ). Surface expression of MHC class II and CD69 was equivalent after immunization with 4-mer, 8-mer, and 60-mer. None of the antigens activated nonspecific B cells ( Figures S2D-S2F ). VRC01 gHL B cells that encounter 60-mer showed increased forward scatter (FSC-A), indicating larger cell size and substantial metabolic activity (Moyer et al., 2020) (Figures 1G, 1H, and S2D) . None of the antigens induced cell division at this time point (Figures S2H and S2I) . Immunization with antigens labeled with a fluorophore (Alexa Fluor 647) confirmed that VRC01 gHL B cells captured similar amounts of each antigen during first 24 h irrespective of valency ( Figures S2J-S2L) . Thus, antigen valency is an important factor driving early B cell activation, with substantial quantitative differences observable over a range of valencies from 1 to 60, with a 4-mer valency being the lowest valency tested that was capable of measurable activation of cognate B cells in vivo.",

Thus, while 4-mer and 8-mer antigens can activate B cells in vivo, a higher valency more potently induces sufficient metabolic activity and CCR7 expression associated with extensive B cell division. CCR7 is a chemokine receptor that regulates B cell positioning within lymphoid tissues (Reif et al., 2002) . Histological examination was conducted to determine VRC01 gHL B cell localization within LNs 24 h after immunization. The majority of VRC01 gHL B cells localized in the B cell follicles in naive animals, as expected ( Figures 2E and 2F ). eOD-GT5 monomer had no measurable impact on B cell localization ( Figures 2E and 2F ). 4-mer and ll Article 8-mer immunization stimulated $50% of VRC01 gHL B cells to redistribute to the T/B border or the T cell zone within 24 h. 60-mer caused $80% of VRC01 gHL B cells to redistribute to the T/B border or the T cell zone, with over one-third of the cells accumulating in the T cell zone ( Figures 2E and 2F ). The 50% redistribution to the T/B border in response to 4-mer or 8-mer immunization corresponded to the observed 50% of VRC01 gHL B cells subsequently undergoing cell division by day 3. In sum, early changes in cell size and CCR7 expression were associated with successful recruitment of B cells into a proliferative response in vivo, with 4-mer valency being the lowest valency tested that was capable of significant recruitment of VRC01 gHL B cells.",

This success of eOD-GT2 60-mer was in contrast to what occurred with low-valency (1-mer, 4mer, and 8-mer) high-affinity antigen immunization ( Figure 1F ). Surface expression of several (but not all) activation markers on VRC01 gHL B cells after eOD-GT2 60-mer immunization was lower than after eOD-GT5 60-mer immunization (CCR7, CD44, and CD86; Figure 4D ). However, the expression of CCR7 was significantly elevated after eOD-GT2 60-mer immunization compared to adjuvant alone ( Figure 4D ), and $70% of VRC01 gHL B cells accumulated in the T/B border or the T cell zone ( Figures  4E and S4 ). Thus, across the range of valencies and affinities tested herein, which we consider physiologically relevant for many contexts, the robustness of early B cell activation (i.e., prior to the first cell division) is dominantly influenced by valency and to a lesser extent by affinity.",

VRC01 gHL B cell divided more slowly in response to eOD-GT2 gp61 60-mer compared to eOD-GT5 gp61 60-mer ( Figures 4J-4L ). However, eOD-GT2 gp61 60-mer was still able to drive virtually all VRC01 gHL B cells in a LN to undergo cell division by 3 days post-immunization, unlike low-valency high-affinity antigens ( Figures 4J and 4M , in comparison to Figures 2A, 2C , 3G, and 3I). eOD-GT2 gp61 60-mer (high-valency/low-affinity) immunization also stimulated early GC B cell and PC differentiation by 72 h, but to a lesser degree than the high-valency/high-affinity eOD-GT5 gp61 60-mer ( Figures 4N-4P ). Given that differential effects on B cell were observable as early as 2-24 h (reflecting direct effects of antigen-B cell interaction) (Figure 1) , and differentiation into early GC B cell and PC lineages both required CD4 + T cell help, it is plausible that the large difference in early GC B cell and PC frequencies between 60-mer and 4-mer reflects the combined results of direct effects of multivalency on BCR signaling plus increased antigen presentation to CD4 + T cells triggering greater T cell help to the B cells encountering multivalent antigen. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that valency has a major impact on early B cell activation, division, and differentiation, such that a 60-mer valency can impart a similar degree of activation, division, and differentiation for antigens differing in K D affinity by at least a factor of 50.",

To explore if antigen valency modulates competitive fitness of B cells under more physiological precursor frequency conditions, we performed adoptive transfer of 10 3 VRC01 gHL B cells into B6 mice (Figure 5A ). This recapitulated the approximate precursor frequency of VRC01-class naive B cells in healthy, HIV-seronegative humans at $1:10 6 B cells Havenar-Daughton et al., 2018; Jardine et al., 2016) . We tested the ability of the physiologically rare VRC01-class B cells to respond to a relatively high-affinity antigen, eOD-GT5, encountered as either a 4-mer or 60-mer. Naive SMARTA CD4 + T cells were co-transferred to ensure that adequate cognate help would be available to VRC01 gHL B cells ( Figure 5A ). eOD-GT5 gp61 4-mer and 60-mer similarly induced expansion of SMARTA CD4 + T cells and Tfh differentiation 6 days post-immunization ( Figures S5A-S5F) . 60-mer immunization primed stronger overall GC B cell responses than the 4-mer ( Figures 5B, 5C , and S5G). Interestingly, the representation of VRC01 gHL B cells in day 6 GCs differed depending on antigen valency. VRC01 gHL B cells constituted less than 0.5% of the total GC B cells induced by 60-mer but $3% of the total GC B cells induced by 4-mer ( Figure 5B , 5D, and S5G). As a result of these two countervailing effects, equivalent numbers of VRC01 gHL GC B cells were detected at day 6 after 60-mer or 4-mer immunization ( Figure 5E ).",

VRC01 gHL B cells from mice immunized with eOD-GT5 gp61 4-mer and 60-mer equivalently bound antigen probes ( Figures S5M-S5P) , indicating that BCR downregulation or blocking did not contribute to the low frequency of probe-binding cells in mice immunized with 60-mer.

Phenotypic analysis of differentiation tran-scription factors (Bcl6 and IRF4) at early time points indicated a role for valency both in GC B cell and PC fate commitment, as the majority of VRC01 gHL B cells remained uncommitted at day 4 after 4-mer immunization ( Figures 3J-3M) . We assessed PC responses 6 days after immunization with eOD-GT5 gp61 4mer or 60-mer ( Figure 5A ). 60-mer induced stronger CD138 + IRF4 + PC responses than 4-mer ( Figures 6A and 6B ). VRC01 gHL B cells constituted greater than 10% of the PC compartment in mice immunized with eOD-GT5 gp61 60-mer ( Figures 6A and  6C ), while they constituted only $0.5% of GC B cells in the same mice ( Figure 5D ). VRC01 gHL PCs were more numerous after immunization with 60-mer than 4-mer ( Figure 6D ), and the VRC01 gHL B cells constituted a larger fraction of the PC compartment after immunization with 60-mer compared to 4mer ( Figure 6C ). Consistent with these observations of increased differentiation of antibody secreting cells in response to high-valency antigens, eOD-GT5 gp61 60-mer immunization elicited more rapid and robust serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers that persisted over time ( Figure 6E) . These data showed similar quantitative effects of valency on GC B cell and PC response at the population levels, but also quite differential effects on recruitment of particular B cell clones. The disparities in the representation of VRC01 gHL B cells in GC B cells and PCs after immunizations implied that affinity thresholds differ in each lineage, and they were modulated to varying degrees by antigen valency. We assessed antigen-binding capacity of endogenous B cells that were recruited into the PC response. Greater than 50% of endogenous IgD \u00c0 CD138 + PCs primed by eOD-GT5 gp61 4-mer were high-affinity cells, based on their binding of antigen probes ex vivo (Figures 6F, 6G , and S5G). In contrast, a smaller fraction of endogenous PCs were high-affinity cells after eOD-GT5 gp61 60-mer immunization (Figures 6F and 6G) . Notably, high-affinity endogenous B cells were a greater fraction of PCs than GC B cells after immunization with either 60-mer or 4-mer ( Figures 6H and 6I) . These data indicate that higher-affinity B cells generally dominate a PC response, but extensive antigen multimerization increases the likelihood of lower-affinity B cells receiving sufficient IRF4 induction to differentiate into PCs.",

The trajectory of VRC01 gHL B cell competitive fitness in GC from day 6 to day 16 after eOD-GT2 gp61 60-mer immunization was similar to that of eOD-GT5 gp61 60-mer immunization (10-fold gain in representation in GCs; Figure 7E ), although starting from a moderately lower starting point (Figures 7B and 7E) . In contrast, after immunization with eOD-GT2 gp61 4-mer, VRC01 gHL B cells were outcompeted in GCs almost immediately by endogenous B cells (Figures 7E-7G) . Severe attrition of VRC01 gHL GC B cells occurred between days 6 and 8 (Figures 7E and 7F) . These data result in some unexpected conclusions regarding the effects of antigen valency on GC responses. When considering a B cell with a relatively high starting affinity, low-valency (4-mer) and high-valency (60-mer) antigens resulted in similar outcomes over time, with 60-mer performing only moderately better overall up to day 28 ( Figure 7D ). However, the kinetic differences show that mechanistically these similar outcomes were for different reasons. This appears to be due to relatively stringent affinity requirements to GC recruitment after exposure to a low-valency antigen (Figure 5) , causing a high initial representation of high-affinity clones ( Figure 7B , day 6), which then decays for unknown reasons. Rapid attrition of VRC01-class B cells in GCs primed by low-affinity eOD-GT2 4-mers indicates that between the affinities of VRC01 gHL for eOD-GT5 (K D = 250 nM) and eOD-GT2 (K D = 14 mM) is a threshold, and there exist many endogenous B cells that can outcompete low-affinity, but not high-affinity, VRC01-class B cells. In contrast, for high-valency antigens these data suggest that multivalency fosters competitive fitness of VRC01-class B cells with a broad physiological affinity range because of less stringent initial affinity-based selection imposed on these B cells. Thus, a high-valency antigen mutes competition to a substantial degree, ''leveling the playing field'' for GC B cells with a wide range of affinities.",

In both cases, GC B cells were found to be not sensitive to a $10-fold reduction in antigen density.

This is distinct from other experimental approaches, in which different ratios of B cell antigen (e.g., hapten or HEL) and a carrier protein are coupled.

Unlike relatively homogeneous B cell responses induced by simple antigens such as haptens (Jacob et al., 1993) , B cell responses to complex antigens are clonally diverse (Kuraoka et al., 2016; Tas et al., 2016) , and some GC B cells that fail to bind the native antigen have been considered likely to be specific to non-native ''dark antigens'' (Kuraoka et al., 2016) . B cell clones can display markedly different kinetics and dominate in GC responses at different times (Kuraoka et al., 2016) . We observed contrasting kinetics of the same B cell clone (i.e., VRC01 gHL B cells) in GCs depending on antigen valency. One possibility is that valency continues to have effects on affinity-based selection in late GCs. Another likely possibility relates to differential antigen persistence. Highly glycosylated nanoparticles like eOD 60-mers are recognized by mannose-binding lectins, leading to efficient complement-dependent transport to follicular dendritic cells (Tokatlian et al., 2019) . Overall, our data on mechanisms by which antigen valency directs B cell biology in vivo reinforce the concept that, for germline-targeting or epitope-focused vaccine designs, using nanoparticles to display many copies of appropriate epitopes is usually the best priming approach. In a situation where desirable ''on-target'' B cells have high-affinity binding, a lower-valency vaccine immunogen may be best, as it will avoid extensive engagement of off-target competitors.",

            "text": "Immunogens and Adjuvant eOD-GT2, eOD-GT5 and eOD-GT5-KO2 (KO11b) monomers and 60mers have been described previously Jardine et al., 2013) . Our original measurement of the K D for monomeric eOD-GT5 analyte binding to VRC01 gHgL IgG ligand was 530nM, measured using a Biacore 2000 (GE Healthcare) (Jardine et al., 2013) . We have subsequently re-measured that interaction on Biacore 4000 (GE Healthcare) with different batches of proteins, obtaining a K D of 240 nM with the data fitting well to a simple kinetic model. We have also measured related interactions in two additional formats on ProteOn (Bio-Rad): (a) using monomeric eOD-GT5 ligand (amine-coupled to sensor) and VRC01 gHgL Fab analyte, we measured a K D of 110 nM but with complex kinetics that did not fit a simple model; and (b) using eOD-GT5 60-mer ligand (captured by VRC01 IgG) and VRC01 gHgL Fab analyte, we measured a K D of 120 nM also with complex kinetics that did not fit a simple model. We conclude from these data that the K D for eOD-GT5 interaction with VRC01 gHgL is $250nM. The K D values for monomeric eOD-GT2 were 15, 11, 14 and 17 mM in the same experiments as described above. We conclude that the K D for eOD-GT2 interaction with VRC01 gHgL is at least 50-fold lower than eOD-GT5 at $14mM. eOD-GT5-KO2 contains the sequence for eOD-GT5 with mutations in the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) to ablate VRC01-class binding. For eOD-GT5 4-mer, eOD-GT5 was genetically fused to the N terminus of a parallel four-stranded coiled-coil GCN4 leucine zipper core mutant (PDB: 1GCL) (Harbury et al., 1993) with a His-tag added at the C terminus. For eOD-GT5 8-mer, eOD-GT5 was genetically fused to both ends of an anti-parallel four-stranded GCN4 leucine zipper core mutant (PDB: 2B22) (Deng et al., 2006) with a Histag added at the C terminus. In some experiments, eOD-GT5 antigen constructs fused with the LCMV gp 61-80 helper epitope (GLKGPDIYKGVYQFKSVEFD) were used to ensure consistent availability of MHC II (I-A b )-restricted epitopes. For eOD-GT2 gp61 and eOD-GT5 gp61 4mers, LCMV gp 61-80 was fused at the C terminus of 1GCL. For eOD-GT2 gp61 and eOD-GT5 gp61 60mers, the original linker (GGSGGSGGSGGSGGG) between the N-terminal lumazine synthase and C-terminal eOD has been replaced with LCMV gp 61-80 . Anti-parallel eOD-GT5 gp61 4-mer was generated by the genetic fusion of eOD-GT5 with the N terminus of 2B22, and a His-tag and LCMV gp 61-80 with the C terminus. Amino acid sequences for the eOD constructs used in this manuscript are listed in Table S1 .",

Free fluorophores were removed using a PD-10 desalting column (GE, Cat# 17-0851-01) and the conjugated protein was concentrated in PBS using centrifugal filters. The labeling stoichiometry was determined by measuring the protein and fluorophore molar concentrations of the conjugate using a NanoDrop One spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with mass extinction coefficient of the protein and the fluorophore specified under ''Protein & Labels'' settings. Adoptive transfer and immunization B cells were purified from the spleen using CD43 MACS MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat# 130-049-801) following the manufacturer's protocol. B cells were adoptively transferred via retro-orbital injection in 200mL RPMI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 11875119) supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini, Cat# 100-106) 1-3d before vaccination. Purity of B cells was routinely above 95%, as determined by B220 staining. eOD-specific cells typically represented 90%-95% or 35%-40% of total B cells purified from homozygous VRC01 gHL or heterozygous VRC01 gHL mice, respectively, as determined by eOD-GT8 60-mer staining. Less than 0.1% of polyclonal B cells purified from WT mice (B6 or CFP) bound eOD-GT8 60-mer. Cell numbers were adjusted according to purity of B cell populations of interest (i.e., total B220 + cells for polyclonal B cells, eOD-GT8 + B220 + cells for VRC01 gHL B cells) for adoptive transfer.

Nickel affinity chromatography was performed using a HisTrap HP His tag protein purification column (Cytiva, Cat# 17524801). Lectin affinity chromatography was performed using Galanthus Nivalis Lectin agarose beads (Vector Laboratories, Cat #AL-1243). Monomers, 4mers and 8mers were subsequently polished by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 column (Cytiva, Cat# 17517501). 60mers were polished with a Superose 6 10/300 size exclusion chromatography column (Cytiva, Cat# 17517201). Both columns were run on an \u00c4 KTAxpress HPLC (Cytiva Cat# 18664501). All eOD constructs were characterized by size exclusion chromatography coupled in-line with a multi-angle light scattering detector (SEC-MALS; Wyatt Corporation) and native protein gels. Endotoxin levels were less than 0.1 endotoxin unit (EU) per injection dose. A soluble immune stimulating complex (ISCOM)-like saponin nanoparticle adjuvant (ISCOMs) comprised of self-assembled cholesterol phospholipids, and quillaja saponin was generated and purified as previously described (Cirelli et al., 2019) . 20 mg/ml solutions of cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Cat# 700000) and DPPC (Avanti Polar Lipids, Cat# 850355) were prepared in 20% MEGA-10 (MilliporeSigma, Cat# D6277) detergent. Quil-A saponin (InvivoGen, Cat# vac-quil) was dissolved in Milli-Q water at a final concentration of 100 mg/ml. Quil-A, cholesterol, and DPPC were mixed at a molar ratio of 10:10:5 followed by dilution with PBS for a final concentration of 1 mg/ml cholesterol. The solution was allowed to equilibrate overnight at room temperature, followed by dialysis against PBS using a 10k MWCO membrane. The adjuvant solution was then sterile filtered, concentrated using 50k MWCO centrifugal spin filters, and further purified by FPLC using a Sephacryl S-500 HR size exclusion column. The cholesterol content was determined using Cholesterol Quantification Assay kit (MilliporeSigma). One unit of ISCOM-like saponin nanoparticle adjuvant (ISCOMs) corresponds to 0.2mg cholesterol and 1mg saponin content. ISCOMs are soluble in PBS and known not to physically interact with or modify protein antigens.",

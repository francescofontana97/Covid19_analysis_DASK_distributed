Yet little attention has been paid to measurement validity and demographic bias, due in part to the lack of documentation about which users are represented as well as the challenge of obtaining ground truth data on unique visits and demographics. We illustrate how linking largescale administrative data can enable auditing mobility data for bias in the absence of demographic information and ground truth labels. More precisely, we show that linking voter roll data-containing individual-level voter turnout for specific voting locations along with race and age-can facilitate the construction of rigorous bias and reliability tests. These tests illuminate a sampling bias that is particularly noteworthy in the pandemic context: older and nonwhite voters are less likely to be captured by mobility data. We show that allocating public health resources based on such mobility data could disproportionately harm high-risk elderly and minority groups.",

This opacity prevents data consumers such as policymakers and researchers from understanding who is represented in the mobility data, a key question for enabling effective and equitable policies in high-stakes settings such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

We define coverage with respect to a POI: coverage is the proportion of traffic at a POI that is recorded in the mobility data. For privacy reasons, many mobility datasets are aggregated up from the individual level to the physical point-of-interest (POI) level. Due to this aggregation, we lack the resolution to assess individual-level coverage quantities like the fraction of members of a demographic subgroup of interest who are represented in the data. Nonetheless, our POI-based notion of coverage is relevant for many COVID-19 policies that are made based on traffic to POIs, such as deciding to close certain business sectors or determining where to locate resources like pop-up testing sites. We use differences in the distributions of age and race across POIs to assess demographic disparities in coverage.",

            "text": "Second, our work relates to existing work on demographic bias in smartphone-based estimates [51] . A notable line of survey research has examined the distinct demographics of smartphone users [18, 36] . [49] and [50] document significant concerns about mobility-based estimates from mobile phone data, including particularly low coverage for elderly. The literature further finds that smartphone ownership in the United States varies significantly with demographic attributes [6] . In 2019 an estimated 81% of Americans owned smartphones with ownership rates of 96% for those aged 18-29 and ownership rates of 53% for those aged over 65 [42] . Racial disparities in smartphone ownership are less pronounced, with an ownership rate of 82%, 80%, and 79% for White, Latinx, and African-American individuals, respectively. Even conditional on mobile phone ownership, however, demographic disparities may still exist. App usage may differ by demographic group. According to one report, 69% of U.S. teenagers, for instance, use Snapchat, compared to 24% of U.S. adults. Of particular relevance to mobility datasets, the rate at which users opt in to location sharing may vary by demographic subgroup. Hoy and Milne, for instance, reported that college-aged women exhibit greater concerns with third party data usage. And even among users who who opt in to a specific app, usage behavior may differ according to demographics. Older users, for instance, may be more likely to use a smartphone as a \"classic phone\" [3] .",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employs SafeGraph data to examine the effectiveness of social distancing measures [37] . According to SafeGraph, the CDC also uses SafeGraph to identify healthcare sites that are reaching capacity limits and to tailor health communications. The California Governor's Office, and the cities of Los Angeles [19] , San Francisco, San Jose, San Antonio, Memphis, and Louisville, have each relied on SafeGraph data to formulate COVID-19 policy, including risk measurements of specific areas and facilities and enforcement of social distancing measures. Academics, too, have employed the data widely to understand the pandemic: [10] used SafeGraph data to examine how social distancing compliance varied by demographic group; [15, 16] used SafeGraph to infer the effect of \"superspreader\" events such as the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and campaign events; [40] examined whether social distancing was more prevalent in in areas with higher xenophobia; and [1] examined whether social distancing compliance was driven by political partisanship, to name a few.

The racial breakdown of device holders, for instance, was allocated proportionally based on the racial breakdown of a CBG. SafeGraph then compared the total SafeGraph imputed demographics against census population demographics at the national, state, county, and CBG levels. According to Safe-Graph, the results looked \"quantitatively very close to the expected\" at the state and county levels, but the sampling rates at the CBG level looked highly unrepresentative. SafeGraph warned that \"local analyses examining only a few CBGs\" should proceed with caution. SafeGraph's examination for sampling bias should be applauded.

First, because SafeGraph lacks demographic information about the users, the imputation of the CBG attributes imposes a strong homogeneity assumption. The mere fact that 52% of Atlanta's population is African American does not mean that five out of ten SafeGraph devices in Atlanta belong to African-Americans. Second, by aggregating demographic analyses nationally for a single attribute at a time, the results may miss significant differences in the joint distribution of features. For instance, if coverage is better for younger populations and for whiter populations, but whiter populations are on average older than non-white populations, then evaluating coverage marginally against either race or age will underestimate disparities. Indeed we present evidence for such an effect in \u00a7 6. Third, the dramatic variation in SafeGraph coverage across CBGs is serious cause for concern because many of the COVID-19 analyses referenced above leverage SafeGraph data at finer geographic units than CBGs (e.g. POIs). This risks drawing conclusions from data at a level of resolution that SafeGraph has not established to be free from coverage disparities. Because SafeGraph's analysis examines demographic bias only at census aggregated levels and does not address the question of demographic bias for POI-specific inferences, an independent coverage audit remains critical.",

Such data has several unique advantages. First, because these stem from official certified records by election authorities, voter turnout information is of uniquely high fidelity. In an analysis of five voter file vendors, Pew Research, for instance, found that the vendors had 85% agreement about turnout in the 2018 election [30] . Second, numerous states break out voter turnout by in person, election day voting. This is critical, given the rise of absentee, mail, and early voting, enabling us to infer the exact count of individuals visiting a specific voting location on a specific day. Third, voter registration forms typically include fields for date of birth, gender, and often race. 4 When race is not provided, data vendors estimate race. The Pew study found race to be 79% accurate across the five vendors, with accuracies varying from 67% for African-Americans to 72% for Hispanics to 93% for non-Hispanics. 5 Fourth, voting (poll) locations provide many data samples across a wide geography with demographic variation, which is necessary given that SafeGraph POI visit information is necessarily aggregated. In short, this administrative data enables us to cleanly infer the demographics and number of visitors to polling locations on election day. We use individual voter records provided by L2 6 , a private voter file vendor which aggregates publicly available voter records from jurisdictions nationwide. Our analysis relies primarily on four fields from the voter files: age, race, precinct, and turnout. While this data is near ideal, it is missing one key piece of information: the poll location. We hence obtained a crosswalk of voting precinct to poll location from the North Carolina Secretary of State. This crosswalk enables us to map each voter via their voting precinct to a SafeGraph POI. We note that poll locations are often schools, community centers, religious institutions, and fire stations. These POIs may hence also have non-voter traffic on election day. We address this possible source of confounding in \u00a7 5.2. Overall, our data includes 595K voters who turned out to vote at 549 voting locations that could be matched. The disparate impact (Def. 3) question in this setting is does SafeGraph coverage of voters at different poll locations vary with voter demographics? We focus on two key demographic risk factors for COVID-19: age and race. We summarize the age distribution at a polling location by computing the proportion of voters over age 65, which we denote by . Let denote the proportion of voters whose ethnicity in L2 data is listed as Hispanic and Portuguese, Likely African-American, East and South Asian, or Other (all voters whose ethnicity was not listed as European). We will refer to as the proportion of non-white voters.",

We can test for timeinvariant confounding, enabling us to make the weaker and more reasonable assumption of no time-varying confounding. A timeinvariant confounder is a confounder that affects our demographic estimate as well as traffic on election day and on nonelection days. This contrasts to a time-varying confounder that affects our demographic estimate and traffic on election day but does not affect traffic on non-election days. Examples of timeinvariant and time-varying confounding are given in Figure 3 . The assumption of no time-varying confounding is untestable but it is reasonable to believe this holds in our setting. Most voting places, 7 Non-voter traffic may affected by device attribution errors, in which device GPS locations are incorrectly assigned to one of two adjacent POIs. SafeGraph reports in its user documentation that \"[it] is more difficult to measure visits to a midtown Manhattan Starbucks than a visit to a suburban standalone Starbucks.\" If younger voting populations are more likely to vote in dense urban polling locations, then even if there isn't large non-voter traffic in the same facility, large traffic in an adjacent facility could still be incorrectly attributed to the polling location with greater likelihood than to a suburban polling location. However, this source of confounding can be controlled for using the same technique described. 8 The adjustment resulted in negative estimates of voter traffic for poll locations at schools. Because of the difficulties in estimating the baseline for schools, we have removed schools from our analysis. 9 In what follows we use the generic variable to indicate either measure of demographics. for instance, are public places making it unlikely that the non-voter traffic is affected differentially on election and non-election days. Another possible time-varying confounder would be if voting locations with older (or largely non-white) voters are more likely to be placed outside of the SafeGraph geometry for device attribution (e.g., parking lot). We do not believe this is likely because voting locations are typically indoors for security and climate reasons during a November election.",

To assess the strength of this signal using the framework described above (Def. 2), we present the correlation between marginal SafeGraph traffic on election day and actual voter turnout. The rank correlation test yields a positive correlation: cor ( * \u2212 * ), ( * ) = 0.445 with p-value < 0.001. 11 Figure 5 displays this relationship by comparing the marginal election traffic * \u2212 * on the -axis against actual voter counts * on the -axis for each polling location. This corroborates that SafeGraph data is able to detect broad patterns in movement and visits. That said, the estimates at the individual polling place location level are quite noisy: root meansquared error is 899 voters with a standard error of 45. For instance, amongst polling places that registered 20 marginal devices, roughly 250 to 1600 actual voters turned out. This significant noise is likely due to a combination of factors. First, SafeGraph may incorrectly attribute voters to nearby POIs because of incorrect building geometries. Second, we are not able to perfectly adjust for non-election traffic.

Second, as we show in Appendix A, age and race are highly correlated in our sample. Polling locations with younger voters are also more likely to have higher proportions of minority voters. We hence fit simple linear regressions to model coverage as a function of the percentage over 65, percentage white, and the interaction between these demographic attributes. Appendix E presents fuller regression results, which demonstrate that once we control for age, the effect for race is more robust. Because the demographics have to be interpreted jointly, the top panel of Figure 7 presents a heat map of coverage with age bins (quartiles) on the -axis and race bins (quartiles) on the -axis. This bottom left cell, for instance, shows that precincts that are the most white and young have highest coverage rates. Conditional on a young precinct, a greater minority population decreases coverage. The lowest coverage is for older minority precincts. The lower panel of Figure 7 similarly plots race on the -axis against coverage on the -axis, separating older precincts (yellow) and younger precincts (blue). As can be seen from the regression lines, there is both an average difference between older and younger precincts and coverage declines as the minority population increases.",

Another further avenue to explore is the methodology for \"normalization factors. \" SafeGraph, for instance, suggests using census block group (CBG)-based normalization factors, essentially using known devices in a CBG against the CBG census population [44] . While this bias correction might help to estimate population parameters (e.g., percentage of CBG population not abiding by social distancing), it is unlikely to capture the kind of demographic interaction effects we document here.

Voter turnout records, which record at the individual level whether a registered voter traveled to a polling location on a specific day and describe the voter's demographic information, enable us to develop a straightforward audit test for disparate coverage. We find that coverage is notably skewed along race and age demographics, both of which are significant risk factors for COVID-19 related mortality.

The service utilizes a variety of basic information 13 to determine matches; of these, we provided the location name (or polling place name), street address, city, state, and postal code for all polling locations in North Carolina in 2018. The match rate, i.e. the percentage of input polling locations SafeGraph could match with one of its POIs, was 77.6%. The polling location dataset, now having SafeGraph IDs for each matched location, was then joined with the SafeGraph Places dataset, which contains basic information like location name and address for the POI, for comparison between the matched POI and the polling location. The SafeGraph matching algorithm was at times too lenient, matching locations near each other but with different names or matching locations with different street addresses. To remedy this, we ran the dataset through a postprocessing script which removed matches where the addresses differed by three or more words to account for false positives. This resulted in a match rate of 47.7%. We then filtered out POIs where SafeGraph returned multiple candidate matches since we could not be confident the first match was the correct match.

We performed this calculation for all North Carolina polling locations and all Tuesdays, excluding Election Days and the first and last Tuesdays from January 2018 to April 2020, with traffic data available from the SafeGraph Patterns data, which gave us 147,613 data points. We tested \u2208 [1, 4] as this considers all weekdays up to the next or previous Tuesday. The following are the evaluation metrics for this approach: Averaging the traffic on the two weekdays before and after a given Tuesday performs best by all three evaluation metrics.",

With the same dataset as the one described for the first approach we used 10-fold cross validation with 3 repeats, with the following results: The linear model using traffic from the four adjacent weekdays before and after the given Tuesday performed the best across both approaches, so we used this model to estimate non-voter traffic on Election Day. We used the model to predict the number of non-voter visits to each of 806 polling location POIs on Election Day (November 6 \u210e , 2018). 10 of the POIs did not have Patterns visit count data for 4 weekdays before Election Day (October 31 , 2018), so we imputed the traffic to be the traffic 3 weekdays before (November 1 , 2018) for those POIs.",

These predictions were then used to repeat the data analyses on SafeGraph coverage as an additional robustness check, producing similar results to original analysis that relied on mean imputation to adjust for non-voter traffic. Figures 13 illustrates comparable results as before. Table 4 presents the full regression results for Section 6.2. The first column shows that the percent of the voting population over 65 is negatively associated with coverage. The second column shows that controlling for age, an increase in the percentage of the population that is white is associated with an increase in the coverage rate. The third column fits interaction terms, for which we present the substantive interpretation in Section 6.2.

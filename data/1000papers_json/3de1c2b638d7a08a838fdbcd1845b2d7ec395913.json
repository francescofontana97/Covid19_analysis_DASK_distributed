Here, we combine it with TiO 2 and ZnO semiconductors, known for their photocatalytic properties, with an eye towards synergistic photo-harvesting and/or antimicrobial effects. We deposit different nanoscale multi-layer structures of curcumin, TiO 2 and ZnO, by combining the solution-based spin-coating (S-C) technique and the gas-phase atomic layer deposition (ALD) and molecular layer deposition (MLD) thin-film techniques. As one of the highlights, we demonstrate for these multi-layer structures a red-shift in the absorbance maximum and an expansion of the absorbance edge as far as the longest visible wavelength region, which activates them for the visible light harvesting. The novel fabrication approaches introduced here should be compatible with, e.g., textile substrates, opening up new horizons for novel applications such as new types of protective masks with thin conformal antimicrobial coatings.",

The antiviral functionality of curcumin (Cur) is believed to stem from its ability to modify the protein structure of viruses, which can depress the activity of the virus or even prevent its entry to the target [1, 7, 8] . Recent reports have indicated that curcumin could be effective even against the coronavirus by inhibiting its encapsulation [8] [9] [10] ; here, curcumin acts by suppressing the cytokine storm, thereby reducing the possibility of inflammation and multi-organ failure, i.e., the major reasons for the increased fatality of the coronavirus infection [8, [10] [11] [12] . Additionally, curcumin has shown anticancer activity [2, 13] . The active functional groups in the Cur molecule, i.e., the antioxidant hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring and the bridging \u03b2-diketone group between two benzene rings, are significant for its antiviral property [10] . Moreover, the scavenging effect of curcumin on reactive oxygen species is considered important in its fight against various pathogens. Having the eye on its medical applications, it is important to supply curcumin in a way that maintains its active functional groups. Another issue is its poor bioavailability which makes oral treatments somewhat unfavorable [14] . Here, a possible solution could be to load, e.g., wearable masks or bandages with Cur molecules using a suitable thin-film coating technique to maintain the activity of curcumin.",

            "text": "In an early study [15] , curcumin thin films were fabricated by simply immersing the substrate in a Cur-containing solution. However, this route involved amine compounds, which is a disadvantage considering the potential use of these coatings in healthcare. The conventional spin-coating (S-C) technique in which the thin film is grown by spinning the substrate with a solution containing the targeted molecules could be another facile route for the curcumin films. This technique has been extensively used for a wide variety of materials including metal oxides, polymers and even multilayered structures [16] [17] [18] . For bare curcumin films, little efforts have been made to exploit the S-C technique [15] , but Cur-based metal complex films have been deposited using this technique [19, 20] . In spin-coating, the film thickness can be controlled to some level by various experimental parameters (concentration and viscosity of the precursor solution, spinning time, rotation speed, temperature), but up-scaling and integration, e.g., with microelectronics are difficult. Additionally, solution routes are likely to leave some solvent inclusions in the growing thin film. Here, advanced gas-phase thin-film techniques, in particular the currently strongly emerging molecular layer deposition (MLD) technique could provide us intriguing options to address these challenges [21, 22] . The MLD technique is an extension of the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology originally developed for high-quality inorganic thin films needed, e.g., in microelectronics [23] [24] [25] . In MLD, the inorganic precursors are replaced by two mutually reactive gaseous/vaporized organic precursors to grow purely organic thin films of high level of controllability and quality. Similarly to ALD, the MLD technique has the capacity to yield precisely thickness-controlled, large-area uniform and conformal coatings on complex and/or sensitive surfaces such as biomaterials and textiles [26] [27] [28] [29] . However, since the MLD technique is based on chemical gas-surface reactions between two different precursors with mutually reactive functional groups, e.g., hydroxyl and amine groups, it first of all requires a co-reactant (organic or inorganic), and secondly is likely to induce some changes in the primary precursor molecule when this molecule is reacting with the co-reactant to form new chemical bonds. Hence, in the case of the Cur-bearing thin films, the possible drawback could be that these changes would destroy the functional features of curcumin that are essential for its antiviral activity.",

It was shown that the Cur moieties are bonded to the Ti atoms via curcumin's hydroxyl groups, but the \u03b2-diketone and methoxy groups were left intact. An attractive aspect in this ALD/MLD approach is that it is possible to further combine the ALD/MLD-grown metal-Cur layers with additional ALD-grown inorganic layers into different nanoscale multilayer structures [30, 33, 34] . In the present study, we will push this option forward, and also investigate the possibility to combine the ALD, MLD and S-C techniques to take a full advantage of their complementary benefits.",

Additionally, they are among the prototype materials in conventional ALD technology, hence well-behaving ALD precursors and processes are readily available for them [38, 39] . The point of improvement with these oxides is the fact that the photocatalytic activity is limited to the UV range only, due to their wide bandgaps (ZnO: 3.3 eV, TiO 2 : 3.2 eV) [40, 41] . Interestingly, there are few promising reports showing that curcumin may be used to sensitize/activate TiO 2 towards longer wavelength (420-580 nm) absorption [42, 43] , or loaded in ZnO nanoparticles to enhance the antibacterial and anticancer properties [44] . Moreover, we have succeeded in tailoring the optical bandgap of TiO 2 thin films by insertion of monomolecular organic (Cur or hydroquinone) layers into regular SL structures using ALD/MLD, such that the films were activated for visible-light absorption [30, 45] .",

From GIXRD (grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction) measurements, the films were found to be amorphous. The density of the films was estimated to be 2.12 g/cm 3 from the XRR data. Most importantly, the FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectrum shown for a representative sample in Figure 2c clearly reveals all the characteristic peaks due to the functional groups of curcumin [47, 48] : presence of aromatic rings is seen from the peaks at 1589 cm \u22121 (symmetric aromatic ring stretching) and at 970 cm \u22121 (trans -C\u2212H vibrations of aromatic ring), \u03b2-diketone groups from the peaks at 1510 cm \u22121 (C=O stretching) and at 1626 cm \u22121 (O=C-CH2-C=O moiety), methoxy groups (\u2212OCH3) from the peak at 1030 cm \u22121 (C\u2212O\u2212C stretching vibration), and hydroxyl groups (\u2212OH) from the large valley around 3500 cm \u22121 . These features are essential for the antiviral functionality of curcumin [10] . ",

In our previous work, we had already developed and optimized the process for the Ti-Cur films, based on TTIP (titanium isopropoxide) and Cur precursors [30] . The deposition temperature was 300 \u00b0C, defined by the relatively high evaporation temperature needed to vaporize curcumin (260 \u00b0C); the precursor/N2-purge pulsing sequence was optimized to be: 15-s TTIP/30-s N2/6-s Cur/15-s N2. In the present work, we carried out a similar process development/optimization for the Zn-Cur films at 300 \u00b0C; for the Zn precursor, the natural choice was diethyl zinc (DEZ) with the pulse/purge condition set to 2-s DEZ/3-s N2 based on extensive previous experience [38, 49] . Then, we gradually varied the pulse length of Cur to find the length required for surface saturation; from Figure 3a , it can be seen that the saturation was reached with a 6-s Cur pulse. For the rest of our experiments with Zn-Cur films, we fixed the ALD/MLD precursor pulsing sequence as follows: 2-s DEZ/3-s N2/6-s Cur/15-s N2. This sequence yielded high-quality Zn-Cur films at 300 \u00b0C with a growth-per-cycle (GPC) value of 2.0 \u212b/cycle. In Figure 3b we compare the growth rates of the two processes, DEZ + Cur and TTIP + Cur, by plotting the film thicknesses as a function of the number of ALD/MLD cycles applied. For both the processes, this dependence is linear as expected, but the film growth rates are different. The lower growth rate (2.0 \u212b/cycle) for Zn-Cur compared to that for Ti-Cur (3.9 \u212b/cycle) is in line with the previous results for other ALD/MLD-grown Zn-organic and Ti-organic films [49, 50] .

This phenomenon, called VPI (vapor phase infiltration) is well known for some ALD precursors when applied onto porous polymer substrates/surfaces [55] . Finally, regarding the crystallinity, we could conclude that all the aforementioned ZnO-based films were crystalline, whereas those based on TiO2 were amorphous. From existing ALD literature [30, 39, 45] , it is known that the crystallinity of TiO2 films sensitively depends on the experimental parameters such as the deposition temperature and the film thickness. Hence, it was not unexpected to notice that not only the TiO2 layers deposited at 120 \u00b0C for the DL structures but also the SL films with ultrathin TiO2 layers between subsequent Cur layers (even though deposited at 300 \u00b0C) were amorphous. To demonstrate the impact of the deposition temperature, we carried out additional experiments to deposit the TiO2 layers for the TiO2/Cur DL films at 300 \u00b0C. Indeed, in this case the TiO2 layers were-similarly to bare 300 \u00b0C-deposited TiO2 films-(poly)crystalline (of the anatase structure).

The slightly different \u03bbmax value of 435 nm for our Cur film as compared to the previous data for curcumin solutions (ca. 430 nm) [57] may be due to the more closely packed Cur molecules in our S-C thin films.

From existing ALD literature [30, 39, 45] , it is known that the crystallinity of TiO 2 films sensitively depends on the experimental parameters such as the deposition temperature and the film thickness. Hence, it was not unexpected to notice that not only the TiO 2 layers deposited at 120 \u2022 C for the DL structures but also the SL films with ultrathin TiO 2 layers between subsequent Cur layers (even though deposited at 300 \u2022 C) were amorphous. To demonstrate the impact of the deposition temperature, we carried out additional experiments to deposit the TiO 2 layers for the TiO 2 /Cur DL films at 300 \u2022 C. Indeed, in this case the TiO 2 layers were-similarly to bare 300 \u2022 C-deposited TiO 2 films-(poly)crystalline (of the anatase structure). The crystallite sizes estimated from the GIXRD peak FWHM values were: TiO 2 33 nm and TiO 2 /Cur 30 nm.",

The slightly different \u03bb max value of 435 nm for our Cur film as compared to the previous data for curcumin solutions (ca. 430 nm) [57] may be due to the more closely packed Cur molecules in our S-C thin films.

Another advantage of the S-C plus ALD approach is the fact that this left the Cur layers intact so that we can expect them to show the antiviral functionality. The most interesting result was that even these separated layers mutually influenced the UV-vis absorption characteristics such that the absorption was not just a simple sum of the individual components. Most importantly, for the Cur/TiO 2 DL film the absorption edge could be extended far towards the visible end, up to ca. 650 nm. This could be of considerable interest for the visiblelight harvesting applications including photocatalysis. For Cur/ZnO DL film, a similar extension of the light absorption range to cover both UV and Vis ranges (330~565 nm) was seen, but the effect was less pronounced than in the case of Cur/TiO 2 . Finally, we observed that the order of the layer piling had a meaning as well. For example, in the case of Cur/TiO 2 reversing the order of layers to TiO 2 /Cur enhanced the absorbance, indicating the positive effect of having curcumin as the top-layer.",

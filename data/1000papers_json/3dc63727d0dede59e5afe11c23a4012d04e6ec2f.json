Initially, chest radiograph was the imaging technique used in our hospital as an effective diagnostic tool in the emergency department. Subsequently, the implementation of a second computerized tomography (CT) equipment has made it possible to carry out a greater number of thoracic CT studies, facilitating the early identification of COVID-19 pneumonia and its complications, including the most common thrombotic or inflammatory phenomena, in order to provide timely treatment. We reported three cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax characterized by CT as a rare complication of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

Five days later, she consulted again presenting dyspnea, fever, and cough. The chest X-ray showed bronchopneumonia and the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, so she was admitted for hospital management (CURB 65 of 1). Management included pharmacological treatment with hydroxychloroquine, ceftriaxone, and methylprednisolone, as well as oxygen supplementation by reservoir with 50% FiO2. During her hospitalization, she presented progressive deterioration of respiratory function with dyspnea despite oxygen therapy, showing atelectasis of the left lung until developing a white lung that was objectifiable in serial chest radiograph studies in the anteroposterior view.

Among the most characteristic findings are groundglass opacities, consolidated opacities, and septa thickening. These cases illustrate the severity of the disease associated with a rare complication such as pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum in this case of spontaneous origin [2] . Although the development of the pneumothorax chamber is usually secondary to barotrauma in patients in the intensive care unit in most cases, our patients did not require, at diagnosis, assisted mechanical ventilation. Therefore, the mechanism of the injury, although not fully understood, may be secondary to alveolar damage from the infection and a rupture of the alveolar wall due to increased pressure from pronounced coughing that occurs in response to the virus. Pneumomediastinum may be due to air leakage through the interstitial space due to increased pressure [3] .",

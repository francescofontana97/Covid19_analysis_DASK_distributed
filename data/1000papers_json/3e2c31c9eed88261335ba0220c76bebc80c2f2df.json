It has been shown in the previous section that the engagement area or transition zone changes significantly when the component is machined from either of these sides under the same cutting conditions. The concave side engages more while convex side engages less in comparison to straight geometries for the identical cutting conditions. The larger engagement area indicates more material being removed for the same RDOC for concave geometries implying higher cutting 5 forces. The converse behavior is expected for convex geometries. This section analyzes surface error profile for three different configurations of thin-walled geometries; straight, circular concave and convex with identical process parameters. The workpiece dimensions, cutting conditions for different geometries and other process parameters are summarized in Table 3 . Figure 6 (a) represents the cutting force variation obtained computationally for three geometries at cutting condition listed in Table 3 . The cutting force are higher for concave and lower for convex geometry in comparison to straight components owing to change of the engagement angle as discussed earlier. The variation in engagement angle also varies the start and end of disengagement for all three geometries. Figure 6 (b) represents the axial variation of surface error computed computationally and experimentally for three geometries under consideration in the study. It can be observed that the straight components deflect significantly higher in comparison to circular concave and convex components. Although the concave component experiences significantly larger engagement area, chip load and cutting force in comparison to straight geometry, the surface error is quite less. Such behavior can be attributed to the geometric configuration of curved structure which is inherently stiffer in comparison to straight geometries that results into smaller deflection values and thereby surface error. This is a favorable situation for the process planner as it permits use of productive cutting conditions while machining concave geometries. An important point to note here is the magnitude of surface error in concave and convex case is comparable to each other even though the convex geometry experiences much lesser engagement area, chip load and cutting forces in comparison to concave geometry. It is expected that the surface error in case of concave geometry would be much higher than convex counterpart but the same is not observed. The effect of engagement area has been studied in the subsequent subsection in order to investigate this aspect in a greater detail.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 902, "end": 909, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 912, "end": 920, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 1041, "end": 1048, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1336, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "Effect of Workpiece Geometry"}, {"text": "The different configurations of thin-walled components were machined with similar cutting conditions but the engagement area was considerably varying due to different nature of workpiece geometry. In order to investigate this aspect further, the concept of 'Equivalent RDOC' has been devised by considering constant engagement area in this subsection. The 'Equivalent RDOC' represents the value at which radial engagement angle is identical for both straight and circular geometries. Figure 8 depicts the schematic representation to understand the concept of 'Equivalent RDOC'. Figure 8 shows machining with variable RDOC for different geometries but the engagement angle is maintained at the same level in each case. The programmed RDOC in each case is different due to curved nature of workpiece i.e. concave and convex workpiece curvature.

The convex geometry is having larger RDOC while concave geometry has smaller RDOC than the straight ones. These values are considered as 'Equivalent RDOC' since it offers constant engagement angle in the each case. In order to implement this concept, initial or un-machined thickness (D) of the plate is required to be varied to have the uniformity in the final or machined thickness of the component. This necessitates reduction in the un-machined thickness (D) for concave geometry which results into diminishing of workpiece rigidity. Similarly, the un-machined thickness (D) increases in case of convex geometry leading to enhanced rigidity for un-machined components. Such variation of initial workpiece rigidity due to different RDOC affects the deflection pattern and surface error for the machined component. Table 4 summarizes the cutting conditions and resultant dimensions of the un-machined workpiece for different geometries. Figure 7 (a) represents the cutting force variation obtained computationally for three geometries at cutting conditions listed in Table 4 . The cutting force are higher for concave and lower for convex geometry in comparison to straight components. However, the starting instant of disengagement remains identical due to constant angle of engagement for all three geometries. Figure 7(b) shows the comparison of surface error profile obtained computationally and experimentally for straight, circular concave and convex geometries. It can be seen that the straight geometry deflects more in comparison to circular geometries owing to lesser stiffness and result into higher surface error. Both, concave and convex geometries deflect significantly lesser than the straight geometry resulting into lower surface error. Also, the convex geometry deflect lesser in comparison to concave geometries. The smaller value of surface error for convex geometries can be attributed to enhanced rigidity of the component which thereby reduces the workpiece deflections. Similarly, concave geometries deflect more and results in to higher surface error due to reduction in the rigidity of the component. It can also be inferred that increase of cutting forces due to higher RDOC value in case of convex geometries does not have significant effect on the workpiece deflections and surface error. Based on results shown in Fig. 7 , it can be concluded that convex geometries present inherent machining advantage for process planners. These geometries can be machined with elevated cutting conditions and thereby resulting into more productive rough milling operation. 7 ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 191, "end": 198, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1025, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1148, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1277, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1527, "text": "Figure 7(b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 2547, "end": 2553, "text": "Fig. 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": "Analysis of Constant Engagement Area"}, {"text": "The present study also analyzes the effect of workpiece curvature on surface error during machining of thin-walled components. To substantiate this aspect, the dimensions of thin-walled component are designed such that the volume of material resisting cutting forces is maintained at constant level as of section 3.2. This has been achieved by maintaining thickness, height and length of component at the same level with variation of workpiece radius. It results into thin-walled components with different workpiece curvature but constant volume of material to resist machining forces. Two different geometric configurations of circular concave (Test 1-2) and convex (Test 3-4) components are considered in this study with its dimensions summarized in Table 5 . The other cutting conditions such as RDOC, ADOC, workpiece geometry, cutting tool parameters etc. are maintained at constant level and tabulated in Table 5 . Figure 9 (a) represents the cutting force variation obtained computationally for two different concave geometries at cutting conditions listed in Table 5 (Test 1 and 2). The cutting force decreases with the increase in radius of curvature owing to change of the engagement angle. Figure 9 (b) shows the surface error variation determined computationally and experimentally for both concave geometries with higher (Test 2) and lower (Test 1) radius of curvature. It has been observed that the component with higher radius of curvature exhibits more surface error. This is primarily due to decrease in the stiffness of the concave geometries with increase in the radius of curvature. It has also been observed that the axial location of 'kink' changes with change in workpiece radius of curvature. The axial location of 'kink' in case of concave geometries moves upward due to decrease in the engagement angle which indicates delayed entry of the subsequent cutting flute in the cut. Figure 10 (a) represents the cutting force variation obtained computationally for two different convex geometries at cutting conditions listed in Table 5 (Test 3 and 4).

It can be seen that the component with higher workpiece curvature exhibits more surface error. Such behaviour can be attributed to two factors; (i) the increased engagement area leading to increased cutting forces on the component, and (ii) decrease in component stiffness with increase of workpiece curvature. It has also been realized that the axial location of 'kink' changes with the change of workpiece curvature. The axial location of 'kink' in case of convex geometries moves downward with increase of curvature due to increase in the engagement angle which signifies early entry of subsequent cutting flute into the cutting zone.

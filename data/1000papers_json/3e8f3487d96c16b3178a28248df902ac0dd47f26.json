Based on CRISPR system and lateral flow assays, 102 Broughton et al. reported a rapid method that could detect SARS-CoV-2 within 40 103 min. Firstly, Extracted the RNA from the respiratory swab sample Secondly, amplify 104 the extracted RNA were amplified by RT-LAMP. Then the tube was open and 105 CRISPR/Cas12 reagents were added into the amplicon solution. Finally the detection 106 results were read out by inserting lateral flow strips into the tube (Broughton et al., 107 2020). This detection method stepped further towards point-of-care testing. However, 108 this method also had some drawbacks. The operators must open the lid for lateral flow 109 assays after nucleic acid amplification. However, after LAMP amplification the 110 concentration of the target nucleic acids in the tube was very high. The amplicons 111 may form aerosol contamination when re-opening the lid, which was a serious 112 problem for nucleic acid detection. PCR has been widely used in molecular diagnosis 113 since it was first published. The limited studies showed that in the next two decades 114 false-positive rates in the laboratory was 9-57% because of contamination (Borst et 115 al., 2004). Due to high sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification such as PCR and 116 LAMP, DNA fragments from the previous experiments may be re-amplified, causing 117 the false positive results of the next detection (Mukama et al., 2020). To prevent 118 amplicons formed aerosol contamination, our research group had done some work 119 based on CRISPR/Cas technology (Qian et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020b). 120 Here, we reported a contamination-free visual method for SARS-CoV-2 detection 121 with CRISPR/Cas12a. In order to prevent aerosol contamination, we did not need to 122 open the tube again after amplification process. Having extracted RNA from 123 respiratory throat swab sample to be tested, RT-LAMP reagents were added in the 124 centrifuge tube. Mineral oil was added to cover the RT-LAMP reagents, which could 125 prevent volatilization of reaction solution and diffusion of amplicons. The upper 126 surface of the amplification reaction solution was covered with a layer of mineral oil. 127 CRISPR/Cas12a reaction liquid was pre-added on the inner wall of the centrifuge tube 128 lid. When Even if the lid was closed, the CRISPR/Cas12a reagents would not drip 129 because of the surface tension. The centrifuge tube was put at the isothermal condition 130 to complete RT-LAMP reaction. Then centrifuge shaking the tube to make the pre-added CRISPR/Cas12a reagents flow into it rather than re-open the tube put in the 3D printing instrument and the fluorescent signal could be seen 136 by the naked eyes with the smart phone. We have demonstrated this method had high 137 specificity and could prevent cross-reaction with other common viruses such as 138 influenza virus. By covering a layer of mineral oil and pre-adding CRISPR reagents, 139 the possible amplicon formed aerosol contamination could be effectively prevented. 140 Combined with the portable 3D printing instrument, the detection results could be 141 judged by producing fluorescence or not. No bulky and expensive instruments were 142 needed in the whole testing process.

Nowadays, Researchers are constantly exploring new detection technologies. CRISPR 91 technology systems is a highly specific good tool for virus nucleic acid detection. Combined with CRISPR/Cas9, a portable, low-cost and paper-based diagnostic 93 platform was reported for Zika virus colorimetric detection (Pardee et al., 2016). reporter unlocking) technology that could to detect Zika virus and dengue virus with 96 high sensitivity and specificity (Myhrvold et al., 2018). Doudna et al. found the Cas12a could cleave single strand DNA indiscriminately when it bound to the target 98 sequence under the guidance of gRNA. Based on it, they developed DETECTR (DNA 99 endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter) method to detect the virus(Chen et al.,",

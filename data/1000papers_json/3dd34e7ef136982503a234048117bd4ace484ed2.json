We used real-world HbA1c data to quantify short-term changes in glycemia and validated psychosocial questionnaires to assess changes in quality-of-life indicators in people during their first few months of CGM use. Methods: Eligibility was assessed during calls to Dexcom sales regarding its G6 CGM System. Eligibility criteria included ages 25-65 years, type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) on intensive insulin therapy (IIT), and no prior CGM use. Participants used a web-based portal to complete the 17-item Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) and the 14-item Hypoglycemia Attitudes and Behavior Scale (HABS); provided validated HbA1c measurements; and shared their CGM data pre-and 3-5 months post-CGM initiation. Satisfaction and ease of use with the G6 System were also assessed. Results: Data were available from 248 patients (182 with T1D, 66 with T2D; 57% male, 88% non-Hispanic white). Mean (standard deviation) HbA1c fell significantly from 8.2% (1.9%) at baseline to 7.1% (1.1%) at the end of the study (P < 0.001); more than half (54.4%) of those with initial HbA1c values >7% experienced absolute HbA1c reductions of >1%. Significant reductions in diabetes distress (DDS) and hypoglycemic concerns (HABS) were observed (P < 0.001). Most (93%) participants were satisfied or very satisfied with the G6 System and 73% found it very easy to use. Conclusions: The first 3 months of CGM use was correlated with improvements in psychosocial outcomes and improved HbA1c levels for people with T1D or T2D who use IIT.",

            "text": "O ptimal diabetes management, especially for patients using insulin, requires frequent glucose monitoring, access to infrastructure and support networks, and willing-ness to adapt to circumstances as they change. Special challenges face people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because of the absolute requirement for insulin and the need to avoid insulin-induced hypoglycemia, whereas progressive beta cell deterioration in type 2 diabetes (T2D) contributes to the elusive nature of glycemic control. 1 Most people with diabetes are unable to reach the American Diabetes Association (ADA)-recommended goal 2 of <7% for glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and most people using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices are unable to reach consensus goals 3 for time in the 70-180 mg/dL target range or time with glucose values >180 mg/dL. [4] [5] [6] Many factors contribute to suboptimal glycemic control, including poor adherence to self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) regimens, 7 poor adherence to prescribed insulin regimens, 8 diabetes distress, 9 and fear of hypoglycemia. 10 Suboptimal glycemic control contributes to excess morbidity and mortality, negatively influences patients' quality of life (QoL), and adds to the societal costs of diabetes. 1 Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems offer significant advantages over SMBG-based glucose monitoring regimens 6 and are foundational to automated insulin delivery systems. 11 Many of the barriers to CGM adoption imposed by early-generation systems-such as daily calibration, insertion pain, and nuisance alarms-have largely been addressed; modern systems are increasingly available, accurate, and easy to use. 12 Data from randomized controlled trials indicate that realtime CGM use is associated with QoL and/or glycemic benefits for patients with insulin-treated T1D or T2D. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] To date, most real-world studies have been limited to anonymized cloud data and lack supportive laboratory tests or robust QoL data. [19] [20] [21] In the Landmark study, we examined glycemic data and QoL outcomes among patients who were using intensive insulin therapy (IIT) to manage their T1D or T2D and began using a real-time CGM system.",

The Landmark study demonstrated significant glycemic and QoL benefits for first-time CGM use among individuals using IIT to manage either T1D or T2D.

The reduction in HbA1c observed in Landmark was similar for patients with T1D and T2D and was more pronounced for participants with higher baseline HbA1c, consistent with observations from the DIAMOND randomized controlled trial. 27 In the Landmark study, there was no standardized training or intervention at CGM initiation, suggesting that the glycemic benefits can be realized without formal instruction.",

Principal limitations include the lack of a control group and the absence of baseline blinded CGM data, which prevents a meaningful assessment of changes in CGM-based metrics of glycemic control. Other limitations for the study include the possible heterogeneity in HbA1c measurement method (point-of-care vs. laboratory reporting), a lack of information about comorbidities that might affect the relationship between ambient glucose and HbA1c, and lack of information about insulin delivery modality; some participants may have used G6 to drive hybridclosed loop systems (like Control-IQ), which could have contributed significantly to HbA1c improvements. 11 In addition, although the G6 CGM System offers several optional features whose use is associated with favorable glycemic outcomes, 28 we did not monitor their use in this study. Furthermore, the results may not be generalizable to users of other real-time or intermittently scanned CGM systems; to patients younger than 25 years, older than 65 years, or not on IIT; or to patients who are not actively engaged in managing their diabetes. Last, the study stopped enrolling at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and we cannot comment on the influence of the pandemic on changes in HbA1c. However, we expect the effect of the pandemic to have been modest, given changes in mean glucose reported by Van der Linden et al. 29 in this same issue.",

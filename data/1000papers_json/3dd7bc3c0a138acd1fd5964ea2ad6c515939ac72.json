To date, there have been no studies evaluating their epidemiology and impact in the ICU. Prior to planning a multicenter study, assessment of recruitment, feasibility, and pilot study procedures is needed. In this pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a large multicenter prospective cohort study. Methods: This feasibility study recruited adult patients admitted to the ICU with TBI and an abnormal cerebral CT scan. In all patients, we documented Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS) and agitated behaviors every 8-h nursing shift using a dedicated tool documenting 14 behaviors. Our feasibility objectives were to obtain consent from at least 2 patients per month; completion of screening logs for agitated behaviors by bedside nurses for more than 90% of 8-h shifts; completion of data collection in an average of 6 h or less; and obtain 6-month follow-up for surviving patients. The main clinical outcome was the incidence of agitation and individual agitated behaviors. Results: In total, 47 eligible patients were approached for inclusion and 30 (64% consent rate) were recruited over a 10-month period (3 patients/month). In total, 794 out of 827 (96%) possible 8-h periods of agitated behavior logs were completed by bedside nurses, with a median of 24 observations (IQR 28.0) per patient. During the ICU stay, 17 of 30 patients developed agitation (56.7%; 95% CI 0.37-0.75) defined as RASS \u2265 2 during at least one observation period and for a median of 4 days (IQR 5.5). At 6 months post-TBI, among the 24 available patients, an unfavorable score (GOS-E < 5 including death) was reported in 12 patients (50%). In the 14 patients who were alive and available at 6 months, the median QOLIBRI score was 74.5 (IQR 18.5).",

            "text": "Behaviors such as agitation, confusion, and aggressiveness are problematic in hospitalized intensive care unit (ICU) patients recovering from traumatic brain injury (TBI). These behaviors create substantial risks and challenges for healthcare providers and may delay mobilization and liberation from mechanical ventilation [1, 2] . Although agitated behaviors after TBI have been reported during the early stage of hospital recovery (acute care units and rehabilitation), there are no data specific for the ICU setting [3] [4] [5] [6] . In addition, predictors, clinical phenotypes, and impact of agitated behaviors on critically ill TBI outcomes have yet to be described. Hence, there is an urgent need to evaluate the incidence and impact of these behaviors on short-and long-term outcomes in large cohorts. Clinical studies to support evidence-based guidelines for the identification and management of these behaviors are also lacking [7, 8] . Consequently, there is no standard approach to managing these patients, and thus many receive pharmacological (i.e., antipsychotics, sedatives, or analgesics) and non-pharmacological (i.e., restraints) interventions that may not be helpful or may adversely impact short and long-term recovery [7, [9] [10] [11] [12] . There is a general consensus regarding the urgent need for clinical studies evaluating optimal strategies for the management of agitated behaviors in TBI patients admitted to ICU [8] . Prior to a multicenter observational cohort study, the feasibility of recruitment and adherence to study procedures needs to be assessed. Pilot studies are essential to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger study and increase the probability of success of the main study [13] . In this pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a large multicenter prospective observational cohort evaluating the epidemiology and impact of agitated behaviors in critically ill TBI patients.",

Given the ICU context and disease acuity, three behaviors from the Agitated Behavior Scale were not documented, as we judged they would be rare or difficult to evaluate in neurologically impaired critically ill patients (wandering, sudden changes of mood and self-abusiveness). These behaviors were replaced with disorientation, hallucinations/delusions, and fighting the ventilator based on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist and RASS score [14, 22] . Bedside nurses documented the severity of behaviors, the interventions used to control the behaviors (reorientation, constant supervision, physical restraint, environmental modifications, and pharmacological interventions), and frequency of treatment interference including accidental removal of catheters and other medical devices. Severity of behaviors was defined as mild if the behavior was present but did not prevent the conduct of appropriate behavior, moderate if the patient needed to be redirected from agitated to an appropriate behavior, and extreme when the behavior interfered with patient care and continued despite interventions including reorientation [21] . Given the suboptimal performance of delirium screening tools in previous studies of TBI patients, we did not measure delirium [23, 24] .",

It may also be that bedside nurses, having a better knowledge of their patients, were in a better position to classify behaviors. Research assistant may also have been more stringent in applying behavior criteria. The usefulness of short videos for future studies may be limited.

            "text": "Clinically, we observed a high incidence of agitation defined as RASS \u2265 2 (56.7%). Individual behaviors such as restlessness, inattention, pulling on tubes and catheters, disorientation, self-stimulating behavior, and uncooperativeness were observed in more than 50% patients. The incidence of agitation was similar to previous studies in non-TBI ICU patients that reported an incidence of 31.8 to 59% using the RASS and Ramsay score [1, 29, 30] . However, agitation seemed greater than in previous studies of TBI patients in other settings which reported an incidence of 19 to 41% [6, [31] [32] [33] . Anger (20.7%) and violent behavior (31.0%), which can cause distress and be dangerous for bedside health care workers, were also reported in an important proportion of patients, most often during night shifts. For this feasibility trial, we did not plan to document psychological or physical consequences for bedside healthcare workers. There may be an opportunity to collect this data in a larger study. As suspected, agitation was associated with self-harm (e.g., nasogastric tube and peripheral catheter removal, falls, and accidental extubation) and decreased ICU-free days within 28 days. Individual behaviors such as restlessness were most often managed with pharmacological agents (antipsychotics, analgesics, and sedatives) and physical restraints.",

As in previous studies of non-TBI patients, a history of drug or alcohol use was associated with agitation [1, 30] . In addition, moderate TBI patients were at greater risk of developing agitation, in part because many severe TBI patients never regained enough consciousness to develop agitation. Interestingly, all patients receiving treatment for ADHD developed agitation during the ICU stay. Male sex was also identified as a risk factor, a finding which may be confounded by factors such as substance abuse and ADHD, which were more common in men. An adequately powered cohort study would enable the evaluation of potential predictors in multivariate models and identify modifiable risk factors.",

The study also estimated the incidence of agitation and individual behaviors in ICU patients, informing future clinical studies. This study also has limitations, including being conducted in a single center. Hence, feasibility in other research sites may be different. As identified with the videos, the intensity scoring for the behaviors may have been suboptimal and additional training will be required for future studies to ensure optimal comprehension of definitions. Although well validated for the evaluation of sedation and agitation in ICU patients, the RASS has not been extensively studied in neurocritical care patients [34] . We opted not to use the ABS to define agitation as it had not been validated in the ICU setting. We also only reported a proportion of the behaviors from the ABS, limiting the psychometric properties of the scale and its capability of measuring agitation. Validation of the ABS or any other agitation scale in the ICU population is warranted for future studies. Finally, this pilot study was not powered to evaluate risk factors and clinical outcomes and thus should be regarded as hypothesis generating.",

This study, therefore, aimed to design and synthesize novel pyrazolone-based compounds as potential inhibitors that would interrupt the interaction between the viral spike protein and the host cell receptor to prevent SARS-CoV 2 entrance into the cell. A series of pyrazolone compounds as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors were designed and synthesized. Employing computational techniques, the inhibitory potentials of the designed compounds against both spike protein and hACE2 were evaluated. Results of the binding free energy from the insilico analysis, showed that three compounds (7i, 7k and 8f) and six compounds (7b, 7h, 7k, 8d, 8g, and 8h) showed higher and better binding high affinity to SARS-CoV-2 Sgp and hACE-2, respectively compared to the standard drugs cefoperazone (CFZ) and MLN-4760. Furthermore, the outcome of the structural analysis of the two proteins upon binding of the inhibitors showed that the two proteins (SARS-CoV-2 Sgp and hACE-2) were stable, and the structural integrity of the proteins was not compromised.",

According to the John Hopkins COVID-19 dashboard, the coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in more than 90.2 million infections and more than 1.9 million deaths worldwide as of January 2021. [1] Genomic studies have established that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta coronavirus family, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, associated with previous outbreaks of relatively smaller scale. [2] [3] [4] Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans; four of these coronaviruses (HKU1, 229E, NL63 and OC43) only cause slight symptoms of the common cold. The viruses can cause severe symptoms and even death, with SARS-CoV-2 having the highest fatality rate and much more contagious than MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV. [5] The virus emerged in December 2019 and, as of June 29, 2020, 6 months after the first outbreak of pandemics, the global count is rapidly approaching 10 million known cases and 500 000 deaths. Due to its broad clinical scope and high transmissibility, which is responsible for the high death rate, the eradication of SARS-CoV-2, as was achieved with SARS-CoV in 2003, does not seem to be a realistic target in the short term. [6] Since the emergence of the outbreak, many studies and clinical trials launched on SARS-CoV-2 worldwide have started yielding positive results, with vaccines' availability in some parts of Europe and the USA after evidence from randomized clinical trials has shown potential therapy improves patients' recovery.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA-enveloped virus. [7] An RNA-based metagenomic nextgeneration sequencing method has been applied to characterize its entire genome, 29 structural proteins, in contrast, to nonstructural proteins, such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, papainlike protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, are encoded by the ORF region. [9] Many glycosylated S proteins cover the surface of SARS-CoV-2 and bind to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), mediating viral cell entry. [10] When the S protein binds to the receptor, Transmembrane (TM) protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a type 2 TM serine protease located on the host cell membrane, promotes the virus to enter into the cell by activating the S protein. [11] Once the virus gains entrance to the cell, the viral RNA is released, polyproteins are translated from the RNA genome, and replication and transcription of the viral RNA genome occur via protein cleavage and assembly of the replicase-transcriptase complex. Viral RNA is replicated, and structural proteins are synthesized, assembled, and packaged in the host cell, after which viral particles are released. [12] The virion envelope of coronaviruses is typically associated with three viral proteins that include the membrane protein (M), the envelope protein (E), and the spike protein (S). Compared to the three proteins, the spike protein (S) is one of SARS-CoV-II's key biological characteristics and several other viruses because it plays a crucial role in penetrating host cells and initiating infection. [13, 14] The S proteins of coronaviruses can be divided into two important functional subunits: The N-terminal S1 subunit, which forms the S protein's spherical head, and the C-terminal S2 region that includes the stalk of the protein, which is directly embedded into the viral envelope. Upon interaction with a potential host cell, the S1 subunit will recognize and bind to the host cell receptors. In contrast, the S2 subunit, which is the most conserved component of the S protein, will fuse the virus's envelope with the host cell membrane. [15] The host cell receptor called Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a protein located on many cell types and tissues' outer surface, including the lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, liver and gastrointestinal tract. It is present in epithelial cells, which line-specific tissues and create protective barriers. It is an enzyme that generates small proteins by cutting up the larger protein angiotensinogen, which then regulates functions in the cell. It is the primary host cell target with which the S protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-II associates. The SARS-CoV-II virus interacting with the spike-like protein on its surface binds to ACE2like a key inserted into a lockbefore entry and cell infection. Hence, ACE2 acts as a cellular doorwaya receptorfor the virus that causes COVID-19. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of these viruses binds to the outer surface of the claw-like structure of ACE2. [16] [17] [18] According to literature studies, researchers have found that compounds containing a pyrazole and its related analogues have received significant attention in chemical, medicinal, and pharmaceutical research as a structural scaffold found in various drugs. [19] As shown in Figure 1 , a new pyrazolone compound, edaravone, also known as MCI-186, has been developed as a medical drug for brain ischemia and has also been reported useful for myocardial ischemia. [20] [21] [22] Compound (A) has been suggested by Anup Masih and coworkers as a potential lead for therapeutic application to control the inflammatory response in SARS-CoV-II infection. [23] Compound (B) 3,5-dioxopyrazolidine has been reported as a SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor. [24] Ramajayam et al., 2010 identified, from high throughput screening, some pyrazolines, particularly those displaying a 1,3,5-triaryl substitution pattern (C), to show activities against SARS-CoV 3CLpro, CoV-229E 3CLpro, CVB3 3Cpro, EV71 3Cpro, and RV14 3Cpro. [19] This reported antiviral pyrazole activity has motivated this study to design and investigate the novel pyrazolone derivatives' inhibitory potentials synthesized experimentally against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) employing in silico methods.",

The drug bioavailability is a measurement of the degree of absorption and fraction of a given amount of unchanged drug that goes to the systemic circulation. [35] Compared with the two conventional drugs, CFZ has the lowest bioavailability scores of 0.11, followed by the 7b, 7h and 8d with 0.17.

Sequel to this fact, this study has examined and evaluated pyrazolone-based compounds' possibilities as potential inhibitors of both SARS-CoV-2 S gp and hACE-2 to inhibit the virus entry into the cells. This study employed synthetic chemistry methods to design pyrazolone-based compounds and computational chemistry techniques to identify these compounds' potential inhibitory activity against the spike proteins and hACE-2 receptor. From this study, 24 novel pyrazolone-based compounds were designed and synthesized. According to the in-silico analysis, the results of the binding free energy showed that three compounds (7i, 7k and 8f) and six compounds (7b, 7h, 7k, 8d, 8g, and 8h) showed higher and better binding high affinity to SARS-CoV-2 S gp and hACE-2 , respectively compared to the standard drugs. Furthermore, the outcome of the structural analysis of the two proteins upon binding of the inhibitors showed that the two proteins were stable, and the structural integrity of the proteins was not compromised. The study further revealed that the lead compounds possess similar pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties to the standard drugs. Therefore, this study suggests pyrazolone-based compounds might be potent inhibitors of the virus entry into the host cells.",

The Leap module of AMBER 18 allowed for the addition of hydrogen atoms and Cland Na + counter ions to COVID-19 S gp and hACE2, respectively, to neutralize all systems. The systems were then suspended implicitly within an orthorhombic box of TIP3P water molecules such that all atoms were within 8\u00c5 of any box edge. [42] An initial minimization of 2000 steps was carried out with an applied restraint potential of 500 kcal/mol for both solutes. They were performed for 1000 steps using the steepest descent method followed by 1000 steps of conJugate gradients. An additional full minimization of 1000 steps was further carried out using the conJugate gradient algorithm without restraint. A gradual heating MD simulation from 0K to 300 K was executed for 50 ps, such that the systems maintained a fixed number of atoms and fixed volume. The systems' solutes were imposed with a potential harmonic restraint of 10 kcal/mol and collision frequency of 1.0 ps. Following heating, an equilibration estimating 500 ps of each system was conducted; the operating temperature was kept constant at 300 K. Additional features such as several atoms and pressure were also held constant, mimicking an isobaric-isothermal ensemble. The system's pressure was maintained at 1 bar using the Berendsen barostat (Gonnet, 2007; Basconi and Shirts, 2013).",

RoG assesses the structural compactness of the proteins upon binding of ligands. The lower the RoG value, the more stable the system. The result of the RoG plots for SARS-CoV-2 S gp systems correlate with the RMSD plot, showing that the three ligands' binding enhances the structural compactness of the protein and stabilizes the system more than the apo-enzyme and the standard drug. The RoG plots for the hACE-2 also correlate with the RMSD plot. The RoG values for five of the six bound ligands are slightly higher than the RoG plot for the apo-enzyme. The binding of compound 7k lowers the RoG plots slightly below the apo-enzyme, making it more stable and compacted than the other compounds and the standard.RMSF is a measure of the effect of the binding of the ligand on the behaviour of the active site residues of a protein. Higher and fewer flexible movements are indicated by high and low RMSF values, respectively. For the SASR-CoV-2 S gp , as shown in (Figure 5b), the standard drug and the apo-enzyme showed the highest fluctuation values indicating more flexibility in their residues movement. This result agrees with the high RoG and RMSD plots reported for the apo-enzyme and the standard drug. Lower RMSF values and flexibility were observed in the three synthesized compounds.

Reduction in H-bonds observed in compounds 7k and 8h (in the hACE2), and 8f (in SARS-CoV-2 Sp systems) might lead to structural imbalances and conformational changes that could eventually affect drug binding.[31,32] Comparative of H-bond and SASA plots of alpha C atoms of the hACE-2 systems calculated throughout 100 ns MD simulations.

The missing atoms of sidechains and protein backbone were added to the protein structure before the molecular docking. The standard drugs cefoperazone (CFZ) and MLN-4760 were accessed from PubChem.[39] The 3-D structures of the pyrazolone compounds and the standard drugs were prepared on the Avogadro software package.[40] Autodock available on Chimera was used for molecular docking[41] with default docking parameters.Before docking, Gasteiger charges were added to the molecules, and the non-polar hydrogen atoms were merged into carbon atoms. The molecules were then docked into the proteins' binding pocket, COVID-19 S gp and hACE2, by defining the grid box with a spacing of 1 \u00c5 each and size and (64 \u00d7 108 \u00d7 46) and (78 \u00d7 102 \u00d7 90) pointing in x, y and z directions, respectively.

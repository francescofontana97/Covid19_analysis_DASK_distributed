We reviewed the recent literature on cross-cultural studies on online behavior and building on Hofstede's theory of cultural dimensions and the theory of planned behavior (TPB), we developed a conceptual model exploring how the dimensions of national culture influence perceptions of website usability, trust, and perceived risk, which in turn impact on intention to use and online purchase behavior. A web-based questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 350 European and Asian consumers actively using Alibaba e-commerce platforms. The conceptual model was validated through a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), while structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to empirically test the hypothesized relationships among variables. Results showed how culture significantly influenced website usability and perceived risk in European consumers and, in turn, their intention and behavior. Differently, culture significantly influenced trust of Asian consumers, as well as their intention and online behavior. With this study, we contribute to the literature on consumer online purchase behavior from a cross-cultural perspective. As culture emerged among the significant antecedents of mechanisms explaining online purchase behavior, e-tailers should tailor digital marketing strategies according to consumer cultural differences.",

Moreover, there is a higher perceived risk of purchasing counterfeit products on Alibaba, in particular, among Western consumers as opposed to Eastern ones (Valarezo et al., 2018) . Scholars have pointed out that one of the main reasons underlying this phenomenon is the different cultural backgrounds of consumers, as the latter dramatically shapes consumer perceptions (Marino et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2017) . Indeed, elements such as national pride or individuals' status in their societies, for example, may drive consumers' preferences (Smith et al., 2013) . Similarly, extant research suggested that customer final purchase decisions are influenced by perceptions of ease of use and risk involved in these platforms (Faraoni et al., 2019) . E-commerce platforms characterized by safe payment procedures and easily understandable by consumers have indeed a competitive advantage over competitors (Zollo et al., 2020) .",

However, some research gaps still exist. Indeed, limited research has explored how culture is related to different customer evaluations concerning website usability, trust, and perceived risk. On the one hand, the cultural dimension theory has been used at most by international marketing scholars to evaluate the entrance in new markets through physical shops and to develop innovative communication strategies (Litvin, 2019) . On the other hand, e-commerce research mostly focused on the exploration of consumers' behavioral dynamics in western markets, which are also the most mature ones (Rehman et al., 2020) .",

A conceptual model based on Hofstede's (2001) cultural dimensions theory and Ajzen's (1991) theory of planned behavior (TPB) was developed. As the focus of this research concerns the observation of cultural difference's importance among Alibaba customers, a cross-country data collection was presented, involving respondents in Europe and Asia. Such an approach allowed us to perform a direct comparison between two different group of consumers. Therefore, we contribute to the existing literature on cross-cultural research on online shopping behavior by analyzing the cultural effects of the use of an international e-commerce platform, and if there are any differences in the online purchasing behavior of consumers from different backgrounds. Specifically, we will shed some lights on the importance of cultural differences on perceived website usability, trust, and risk.",

(b) Individualism-collectivism represents the relationship between the individual and the group. Under this dimension, adherence to the norm and group decisions is more important in Asian countries than individualistic needs or wants (Fam & Waller, 2003) . (c) Masculinity-femininity concerns the social implications of having been born as a boy or a girl. Except for Japan, most East Asian countries are ranked lower on masculinity than most of the Western countries (Hofstede et al., 1998) . (d) Uncertainty avoidance refers to ways of dealing with uncertainty, relating to the control of aggression and the expression of emotions. While East Asian countries score quite similarly on other dimensions, uncertainty avoidance has been suggested as one of the most defining cultural differences among East Asians. For example, the uncertainty avoidance index shows that Japan and Taiwan score high on uncertainty avoidance while China and Singapore score low .",

Additionally, in more recent times, literature focused on cultural difference tried to expand the number of dimensions to be considered (Minkov & Hofstede, 2011) . In this perspective, an additional dimension has been considered among the ones characterizing a national culture: (f) Indulgence-restraint, which refers to the level of self-gratification that a society allow the individual to obtain with his/her own means. Usually, indulgence shows higher level in western countries and Oceania, while national cultures from Asian, African and South America show higher level of restraint. This notwithstanding, such a dimension had been scarcely used by prevailing literature, and researches including it are mostly in seminal phases (Sun et al., 2019) .",

Trust represents a social antecedent of online shopping adoption, therefore e-tailers should build their websites in order to communicate trust to users (Gefen et al., 2003) . According to Chen and Dibb (2010) , key dimensions that affect website trust include usability, security and privacy assurance, and product information quality. From a cross-cultural point of view, Hallikainen and Laukkanen (2018) found that long-term orientation and collectivism interrelate with disposition to trust in e-commerce. Trust is found to be higher in collectivist cultures as compared to individualist cultures, confirming previous research (Doney et al., 1988; Huff & Kelley, 2003) . Regarding long-term orientation, it has a positive effect on disposition to trust suggesting that in long-term orientated cultures, business relationships are typically built on a long-lasting basis (Hallikainen & Laukkanen, 2018) .",

As previously assessed, European and Asian consumers are characterized by different cultural values with respect to their perceptions of power distance, individualism/collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity/femininity, and long-term/short-term orientation. National cultures shape the behavior of consumers in an online environment (Capece et al., 2013) leading to different perceptions of the e-commerce platform usability, trust, and involved risk. In general, Asian countries are characterized by a higher uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation than Western countries, making them less prone to accept risks. As a consequence, perceived usability of an e-commerce platform will be lower in Asian consumers. This could influence the willingness to adopt and use a new technology (Baptista & Oliveira, 2015) . Hence, Asian customers might be more reluctant to engage in online shopping since e-commerce is perceived as having uncertain outcomes (Yoon, 2009) . Therefore, we propose: H1 Culture affects consumer perceptions of e-commerce platform usability. European consumers (H1a) may perceive an e-commerce platform as easier to use than their Asian counterparts (H1b).",

In many countries, both men and women share a common need for achievement, assertiveness, and success. Such countries, as is the case with European ones, are characterized by a diffused sense of masculinity. In Asian countries that are characterized by femininity, it has been observed that both men and women share a common orientation toward modesty. Yet in these countries it is also true that women are frequently viewed as more submissive and less interested in career advancements. The gender gap is therefore wider in feminine cultures (Hofstede, 1991) . Such a trait of national culture could noticeably influence the intention to use an e-commerce platform. European consumers (both men and women) may be more prone to accept a risk, and therefore to use technology (Stafford et al., 2004; Venkatesh & Morris, 2000) , while Asian ones tend to be more concerned about risk. Similarly, the more confident European consumers may perceive a platform as easier to use and may be more prone to trust the e-tailer. Based on these assumptions, we propose: H3 Culture affects consumer perceptions of risk related to the use of a new e-commerce platform.

Indeed, perceived usability could influence consumer satisfaction, trust, and loyalty, thus improving consumer intention to use a platform (Chen & Dibb, 2010) . Consumer perceptions concerning their capability to use a technology could also influence the perceived utility they attribute to it. Similarly, the perceived degree of usability will influence their relationship with e-commerce platforms (Biraghi et al., 2020) . Consumers, in fact, tend to develop better relationships with platforms that they are capable of using completely (Zhang et al., 2011) . Cultural differences also play a role in this regard. More confident consumers, such as European ones, may more quickly perceive a technology as more usable. Thus, it is plausible that the relationship between perceived usability and intention to use will be generically stronger in European consumers. Therefore, we propose:",

The existence of trust is fundamental; indeed, trust is the base of any marketing strategy wishing to build a relationship with consumers. Trust toward the e-commerce platform is another relevant antecedent of intention to use an e-commerce platform. According to Kim and Peterson (2017) , consumers tend to make more use of platforms that ensure safe payments, sell not-counterfeited products, and warrant that products come from certified vendors. Such a phenomenon is related to the cultural background of consumers and country-of-origin of the e-commerce platform. European consumers do not tend to trust Chinese e-commerce platforms; thus, in the specific Alibaba case (or in analogous cases), the relationship between trust and intention to use the platform will be stronger in Asian consumers. Therefore, we propose: H5 Trust positively influences both European and Asian consumer intentions to use an e-commerce platform; but the relationship between trust and intention to use will be stronger in Asian consumers (H5b) than European ones (H5a);",

Prolific allows the avoidance of typical biases of the survey-based approach, such as social desirability bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003) and non-response bias (Rogelberg & Stanton, 2007) . Alibaba was chosen as the focus of the analysis as it is a global player in the e-commerce sector that started its internationalization expansion since 2009 (Anwar, 2017) . Operating among multiple markets, it allows a cross-cultural analysis to explore the characteristics of the online behavior of its customers based in different countries. A twelve-page questionnaire in English incorporating 51 items of validated scales and five control variables was developed and pre-tested by a student panel of 10 respondents enrolled in an Italian university marketing course. English has been selected as the main language of research due to the necessity to create a leveled playing field, using a neutral language for all the respondents. Next, three Italian professors with expertise on consumer behavior completed the questionnaire to check its clarity and ease of completion . After these pre-tests, no changes were made to the final questionnaire which was then completed by 350 respondents, 175 from Europe and 175 from Asia. This sample size is considered as adequate in line with the SEM pertinent literature (see Hair et al., 1998) .",

Specifically, all four sub-dimensions of culture showed adequate factor loadings. For Europe, uncertainty avoidance = 0.67; masculinity = 0.80; individualism = 0.76; power distance = 0.67; long-term orientation = 0.62. For Asia, uncertainty avoidance = 0.68; masculinity = 0.70; individualism = 0.65; power distance = 0.69; longterm orientation = 0.64. Hence, all the constructs were retained in the analysis. Next, we calculated the goodness-of-fit measures to verify the satisfactory parsimony and validity of the proposed six-factor model (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988) . The first set of indicators referred to the absolute fit indexes. For the European sample, the relative Chisquare statistics (Chi-square divided per degrees of freedom) suggested a satisfactory fit of the model (\u03c7 2 /df = 2.895) as it was lower than three (Bentler, 1990) ; the goodness-of-fit index (GFI = 0.948) also showed a good fit of the model as it was higher than 0.90 as required (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988) ; similarly, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA = 0.062) suggested an acceptable model fit as it was lower than 0.07 (Bentler, 1990) . For the Asian sample, we found satisfactory values of absolute fit indexes: the relative Chi-square statistics (\u03c7 2 /df = 2.765), the GFI (0.965), and the RMSEA (0.058) showed a good fit for the model (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988; Bentler, 1990) .",

This is particularly true when considering trust and website usability which are influenced by culture in a stronger way in Europe compared to Asia (Baptista & Oliveira, 2015; Chen & Dibb, 2010) . The reasons for this are explained by Hofstede's (2001) cultural sub-dimensions of masculinity and individualism. European societies are typically masculine since they are based on values such as assertiveness, ambition, power, materialism, and competitiveness; and they are also individualistic, or determined to achieve personal and not collective goals. We have previously validated with the reference literature that a high degree of masculinity implies a perception of higher user-friendliness of the platform. Moreover, a high degree of individualism, as found in most European societies, greatly influences the effect of trust on the intention to use a website (Venkatesh & Morris, 2000) . Culture influences perceived risk more in Asia than in Europe (Hwang & Lee, 2012; Yoon, 2009) since uncertainty avoidance and the power distance cultural sub-dimensions are stronger in Asian culture. Power distance, or the acceptance of a rigid hierarchical structure and disparity between people, has a higher value in Asian than in European countries and is a dimension necessarily linked to the perception of risk, as it reflects the role of authority or superiors in making decisions. Consumers who come from a country with a high level of power distance like those in Asia believe more strongly that they can be deceived by unethical behavior on the part of a salesman than do consumers with a low power distance like those in Europe (Grazzini et al., 2020) .",

The Asian higher perception of risk in shopping online is explained by this cultural value. Our results are a strong confirmation of the assumption that culture and its specific components have to be carefully considered in managerial contexts to define online strategies. Hence, the present research contributes to literature on online purchase behavior by observing the way cultural dimensions affect consumer perceptions of an e-commerce platform and their subsequent acceptance and usage behaviors. Specifically, we observed how masculinity/femininity, short/long-term orientation, individualism/collectivism, and low/high power distance have a simultaneous effect on website usability, trust and perceived risk, which affect the intention to use the e-commerce platform and online purchase behavior. Therefore, e-commerce platforms operating in international markets should design their websites addressing these differences.",

European consumers are highly affected by the design of the website, including attractiveness, the ease of finding information, and the graphic aspect in general; therefore, the colors, the product images, and the type of font used are important. European users search for a uniform and easy navigational scheme that can help them access the various sections of the site.",

Company policies regarding assistance and customer service need to be revised in order to increase consumer trust in Europe. Shipments and order tracking could be improved. Taking the Aliexpress platform as an example, deliveries from China offer a free shipping service and the sellers ship the goods with the cheapest and slowest providers. This implies that delivery time is a critical factor as a possible delay in delivery or a loss of an ordered product can generate a lot of distrust in the consumer towards the platform, since insecurity and the probability of suffering an economic loss prevail over the intention to purchase. Making traceability of all orders available regardless of the cost and shipping method can improve customer trust. The last consideration concerns the return policy in case of lack of conformity with the original sales conditions or product malfunction. This is a very controversial point because on Aliexpress, for example, consumers can receive a full or partial refund if the item does not match the description by contacting the seller directly (the Alibaba platforms act as intermediaries between seller and buyer), but the shipping fee is shouldered by the buyer. As a consequence, it is sometimes less costly to keep the product and agree directly with the seller on the amount of the refund.",

It is up to the user to make sure that the supplier is reliable (for example, by considering only those companies whose identity is officially verified by the e-commerce platform). A further important consideration at the managerial level is that the perceived risk variable influences online purchasing behavior more in Asia than in Europe, even when there is little difference.",

For instance, the Alibaba platform accepts payments by credit cards from Mastercard and Visa, but a major guarantee on the protection of purchases is associated with Alipay, an online third-party payment platform launched in 2003 by Alibaba Group, which benefited from a first-mover advantage as it was the first electronic payment system introduced in China (Hu, 2020) . Alipay allows payments without the need for credit cards or a bank account, but directly by paying with a mobile phone. Although the Alipay system is very widespread in Asia, in Europe it is still in its infancy.",

            "text": "The first limitation on the research concerns our sampling procedure: the sample is not probabilistic because it includes several nationalities, but does not include all nationalities in Asia and Europe, moreover we did not consider intra-group differences; therefore, the sample is not representative of the whole Asian or European continents. Furthermore, the cross-sectional nature of the study does not prevent a sample being homogeneous or composed of subjects belonging to the same social group. Some other limitations are linked to the methodology. Although the structural equation model is among the main methodologies used to analyze consumer behavior, more advanced techniques have recently been developed to test mediation using a bootstrap approach. This means that starting from the collected sample, many new samples are created of equal number randomly extracted with replacement, for example a participant can be extracted several times in a sample. Hayes' (2009) mediation and moderation modeling allows for repeated random sampling with substitution from the data set to calculate the desired statistics in each resampling, and all the bootstrap samples provide an approximation of the sampling distribution of the statistics of interest (see Zollo et al., 2017) . In this respect, we suggest future scholars to expand our conceptual model (Fig. 1) by considering more mediating and moderating influences. For example, the effect of consumers' perceived risk on website usability (Belanche et al., 2012) or the effect of website usability on trust (Chen & Dibb, 2010) might be investigated to enrich our hypothesized framework and provide more theoretical and practical implications. Further, our conceptual model might be better developed by adding all the Hofstede's (2011) cultural subdimensions (i.e., including the indulgence vs. restraint dimension) or considering different and alternative categorizations of consumers' cultural dimensions-see for example McSweeney's (2002) criticism to Hofstede's (2001) model.",

The successful control of the pandemic carried out by China and South Korea is studied using a scheme based on the net relative rate of infection which is very sensitive to sudden changes in the epidemic evolution. The net relative rate of infection for China and South Korea without containment measures, that is, with free proliferation of the virus, lies between 10 and 40 %/day or doubling times of infected persons between 3.5 and 2 days. After measures of containment it dropped and stabilized. South Korea stabilized it around 1 %/day and China around 0.05 %/day with doubling times of 70 days and 1400 days, respectively. A discussion is provided about their processes of control and stabilization of the epidemic process and about the scheme used to study them.",

In this monitoring model, the infection rate by coronavirus is assumed to be proportional to the number of infected individuals on day t, I(t), who act as spreading agents of the infection. We can define a probability of new infection per unit time and per infected individual to determine the infection rate. The rate of removal of infected individuals depends on recovery from the infection, death occurrences or isolation from society. If we assume that this removal rate is also proportional to the number of infected individuals , we can also define a probability of removal of infected individuals per unit time and per infected individual.

The logarithm of the net relative rate of infection is very sensitive to sudden changes in the epidemic evolution and can be used to monitor the effectiveness of containment actions of the epidemic. Additionally, it presents clear trends of the epidemic process and can be used to project future scenarios for the epidemic evolution.",

The net relative rate of infection allows us to monitor the effectiveness of measures to contain the spread of the virus (how fast the relative rate of infection falls). South Korea stabilized around 1 %/day and China around 0.05 %/day. In China, where the epidemic originated, in January 2020 the net probability of infection or net relative rate of infection was 40 %/day and that country started its measures to control the spread of infection in their society. At this time, the doubling time of the number of infected persons was between 2 and 3 days. The measures of social isolation were very strong and produced a continuous reduction of . On February 25 th , the rate was already less than 1 %/day (70 days of doubling time) and on March 8, less than 0.1 %/day (700 days of doubling time or about 2 years). On 03/27/2020 the confirmed number of infected people in China was 81394, the net relative infection rate was 0.06 %/day and the number of new cases per day, very small. The infection reached the other countries strongly in March 2020. In South Korea, the infection process started a little earlier and the country took drastic measures to contain the spread of the virus, including social isolation. In early March, South Korea's net relative infection rate was just below 20 %/day (3.5 days of doubling time). After March 15 th it stabilized around 1 %/day (70 days of doubling time) and on 03/27/2020 the confirmed number of infected persons was 9332. Why did this country decide to stabilize its infection rate around 1 %/day and not around 0.05 %/day as China did?",

The answer to the above question is that in China the net probability of infection per unit of time was 10 times smaller than that in South Korea. The important variable was NCn, the rate of new confirmed cases per day, obtained from the product which can be directly correlated to hospital demands. A figure between 50 and 100 new confirmed cases per day was suitable for their health and epidemic control systems.",

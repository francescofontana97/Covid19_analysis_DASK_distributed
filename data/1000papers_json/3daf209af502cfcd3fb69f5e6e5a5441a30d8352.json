            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious, and transmission involves a series of processes that may be targeted by vaccines and therapeutics. During transmission, host cell invasion is controlled by a large-scale conformational change of the Spike protein. This conformational rearrangement leads to membrane fusion, which creates transmembrane pores through which the viral genome is passed to the host. During Spike-protein-mediated fusion, the fusion peptides must be released from the core of the protein and associate with the host membrane. Interestingly, the Spike protein possesses many post-translational modifications, in the form of branched glycans that flank the surface of the assembly. Despite the large number of glycosylation sites, until now, the specific role of glycans during cell invasion has been unclear. Here, we propose that glycosylation is needed to provide sufficient time for the fusion peptides to reach the host membrane, otherwise the viral particle would fail to enter the host. To understand this process, an all-atom model with simplified energetics was used to perform thousands of simulations in which the protein transitions between the prefusion and postfusion conformations. These simulations indicate that the steric composition of the glycans induces a pause during the Spike protein conformational change. We additionally show that this glycan-induced delay provides a critical opportunity for the fusion peptides to capture the host cell. This previously-unrecognized role of glycans reveals how the glycosylation state can regulate infectivity of this pervasive pathogen.",

In the active virion, the Spike protein assembly (S) is a 3-fold symmetric homo-trimer (1) , where each protein contains \u223c 1200 residues (Fig. 1) . The complex is anchored to the viral capsid by a transmembrane (TM) helical bundle, while the remaining regions reside on the capsid exterior. Cleavage at the S1/S2 and S2' sites leads to activation of the Spike protein, where the resulting subunits (S1 and S2) maintain contact through non-bonded interactions (Fig. 1A) (14) . The receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 can then associate with the ACE2 receptor (4, 15) , which triggers S1 release from S2 (Fig. 1B) . This allows for a dramatic structural rearrangement within S2, during which the fusion peptides must bind and recruit a host cell (Fig. 1C) (16) .",

By comparing the dynamics with and without glycans present, we show how the steric composition of the glycans can extend the lifetime of a critical intermediate in which the head appears to be sterically-caged. This leads to a transient pause that can increase the probability of successfully recruiting the host cell.

In a structure-based (G\u014d-like) model, some/all of the energetic interactions are defined based on knowledge of specific stable (experimentally-resolved) structures. In the context of protein folding, applying these types of models (22) is supported by the principle of minimal frustration (23, 24) . However, to war-rant their application to study conformational transitions, it is necessary to recognize that the models describe the effective energetics of each system (25) (26) (27) . That is, by explicitly defining the molecular interactions to stabilize the endpoint conformations, the models are intended to provide a first-order approximation to the energetics. In the presented model, only interactions that are specific to the prefusion and postfusion configurations were defined to be stable. For the TM region, stabilizing prefusion-specific interactions allow it to serve as an anchor between the Spike protein and the viral membrane. An implicit membrane potential was also introduced to restrain the TM to a plane. Finally, all non-TM interactions were defined to stabilize the postfusion conformation ( Fig. 1) . Qualitatively, this model describes the Spike protein as a loaded (non-linear) spring that is released upon cleavage of the S2' site and dissociation of S1 ( Fig. 2A) . While the potential energy in the model is downhill, molecular sterics can still lead to pronounced free-energy barriers that control the kinetics (28, 29) .",

Cryotomography imaging has revealed that the virus-host inter-membrane distance is approximately 30nm during infection (13) . Based on this, our simulations indicate that, if the Spike protein were not glycosylated, it is most likely that none of the FPs would associate with the host. Since Spike protein rearrangements are irreversible, these failed attempts would represent lost opportunities to infect the cell. Further, when glycans are absent, there is a marginal probability that only one or two FPs would reach the membrane, where the other FPs would likely transition directly to their postfusion orientations without engaging the host. Such a process has been described as a \"cooperative\" mechanism in the Hemagglutinin A fusion protein (32) . However, when glycans are present, there is a non-negligible probability that three FPs will reach the host membrane. In that case, the dynamics may also involve the so-called \"sequential\" mechanism of fusion (32) . Together, these observations demonstrate how the steric contributions of glycans is critical to the mechanism and likelihood of cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2.",

A necessary step during infection involves virus/cell membrane fusion, which is mediated by a major conformational change of the Spike protein. Here, we propose a mechanism where, after cleavage and dissociation of S1, sufficient time has to be made available for the fusion peptides to reach the cell membrane, before the conformational change in S2 can complete. Using all-atom models with simplified energetics, we have shown how the steric composition of post-translational modifications may introduce the delay necessary for such a mechanism to be utilized. This glycan-induced pause appears to allow for an extended window during which the fusion peptides may search for the host cell (Fig. 6 ). In simulations that did not include glycans, the Spike protein was most likely to adopt the postfusion configuration without extending the fusion peptides towards the host. Thus, in the glycan-free case, the protein can bypass the sterically-caged intermediate, leading to failed attempts to capture the host cell. These findings suggest that the precise glycan composition is a critical factor that determines transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.",

Such approaches could identify how to more effectively disrupt the various steps involved with membrane fusion, which could ultimately serve to neutralize the virus.

Figure 1 : Spike-protein-mediated membrane fusion A) The active Spike protein assembly is composed of the subunits S1 (white surface) and S2 (cartoon representation) (2) , which remain bound through nonbonded interactions. Numerous glycosylation sites (glycans shown in orange) are present in the Head Group (HG) and Heptad Repeat 2 (HR2) regions. The modeled glycans are consistent with previous studies (7, 13) . B) Upon recognition of the ACE2 receptor and cleavage at the S2' site, S1 dissociates. In addition to the HG and HR2 regions, S2 is composed of the Heptad Repeat 1 (HR1), Linker (L), Fusion Peptide (FP), Connector (CR) and Transmembrane (TM) regions. Since the HR2 and TM regions were not resolved in the prefusion structure (2), they were modeled as a helical bundle, consistent with previous studies (7) . C) Release of S1 allows for the FPs to associate with and recruit the host membrane. The HG and HR1 regions undergo a large-scale rotation (> 90 \u2022 ), leading to fusion of the host and viral membranes. Since the CR and FP regions were not resolved in the postfusion structure (30), they were modeled as an extended helical bundle. Figure 2 : Simulating Spike-protein-mediated membrane fusion Simulations with an allatom structure-based model (20, 21) allow for transitions between prefusion and postfusion configurations to be observed. A) Schematic representation of the energetics in the structurebased model. The postfusion configuration was defined as the global potential energy minimum. The pre-cleavage state (green) is assumed to be stable, where cleavage and release of S1 leads to an unstable prefusion configuration (black). While, in the employed model, stabilizing energetic terms favor the postfusion configuration, steric interactions between the protein and glycans may impede the motion (black vs. red). B) Representative simulation (1 of 1000) of the pre-to-post transition. Spatial rmsd from the post configuration (excluding TM, CR and FPs), as a function of time. The simulation included explicit glycans, as well as an effective viral membrane potential. C) After an initial relaxation phase (panel B), the head (red) appears to become caged by the HR2 strands (gray), allowing it to sample configurations near the viral membrane (pink). While the host membrane (yellow) was not included in the simulations, it is depicted for illustrative purposes. D) After reaching the caged ensemble, the head escapes and the HR1-HR2 superhelix assembles. The position of the head group, relative to the TM region (blue), is described by the cylindrical coordinates r head and z head . The origin is defined as the geometric center of TM, and the cylindrical axis is perpendicular to the viral membrane. See methods for details. E) Probability distribution of simulated events (with glycans) reveals an obligatory cage-like intermediate. Figure 3 : Glycan-induced caging of the head domain. Glycans impede head rearrangement by introducing a steric cage. A) Snapshot from the caged ensemble illustrates the high density of glycans surrounding the head. B) To define the duration of each caging event (\u03c4 cage = \u03c4 exit \u2212 \u03c4 enter ), we measured z head and r head (Fig. 2D) . Based on the 2D probability distribution (Fig. 2E) , the system was defined as entering the cage when z head first drops below 6.5 nm: \u03c4 enter . \u03c4 exit is the time at which the head moves laterally, relative to the trans-membrane region (r head > 5 nm). C) Distribution of \u03c4 cage values when glycans are present. There is an extended tail at large values (100 \u2212 500\u00b5s). D) When glycans are absent, the \u03c4 cage values are narrowly distributed around short timescales. Distribution when glycans are not included. When glycans are absent, it is common that HR1 is not completely formed (i.e. Q HR1 <1350) prior to HG escape. C) Representative snapshot of a caged structure in which HR1 is fully formed and extended toward the host. D) Representative snapshot of a glycan-free case where the head escapes prior to fully forming HR1. As a result, HR1 can adopt bent configurations. There is a higher probability of extending to larger d host values when glycans are present (black vs. red curves). This is due to the glycan-induced delay of head rotation (Fig. 3) , which ensures the HR1 helix remains directed towards the host as the FPs sample extended configurations. D-F) The probability that 1, 2 or 3 FPs exceed d host . In all cases, the presence of glycans shifts the distribution to larger values of d host , indicating an increased probability of capturing the host. This reveals a critical role for glycans during cell invasion. Figure 6 : Schematic of transition mechanism of the Spike protein Initial activation of the Spike protein (left) is associated with release of S1, which is triggered by cleavage at the S2' site and ACE2 receptor binding. When glycans are present (top), HG will enter a caged ensemble where the FPs search for, and capture, the host membrane. HG can then escape the cage, which draws the viral and host membranes together and leads to fusion. In the absence of glycans (bottom), HG can bypass the caged ensemble, resulting in a failed attempt to recruit the host.",

For the postfusion state we used a structural model of the SARS-CoV-1 system (PDB ID: 6M3W (30)) as a template for constructing a homology model of the SARS-CoV-2 system. However, the postfusion model was lacking residues 772-918 and 1197-1233 (FP, CR and TM). In addition, since available structures only partially resolved the base of each glycans, we constructed structural models of the complete glycans for both states (pre and post). For the prefusion structure, models of the TM and HR2 regions were constructed using the homology modeling webtool of SWISS-MODEL(33). Consistent with the study of Casalino et al(7), both regions were modeled as coiled coils, where the sequence was assigned Uniprot (34) sequence P0DTC2-1. This was accomplished with the automodel module with special restrains to preserve symmetry of Modeller 9.24(35). The resulting model was three-fold symmetric, where the RMSD between monomers was less than 1\u00c5. For the postfusion structure, missing residues in FP, CR and TM were modeled as helical regions, using the automodel module of Modeller 9.24. CR and FP were modeled as coiled coils that are connected by short disorder loops. To define the CR and FP regions, homology models were constructed based the structure of a coiled coil template (PDB ID: 2WPQ",

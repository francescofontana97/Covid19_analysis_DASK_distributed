For example, manufacturers' first concern always is with how efficiently the cargo reaches its destination without any delay or any sort of complication. This is important because of the reputation of the company, which solely depends on customer perception. Businesses flourish based on the manufacturer's capability of meeting these customer expectations. One approach to maintaining good logistical support and cutting costs is to concentrate on communication solutions such as tracking shipment, status update, and accommodating last minute change request. With the advancement of technology, many services are available to the customer by limiting confusion, ambiguity, and inefficiency. As a result, these services such as shipment tracking helps not only pushes away unnecessary expenses out of the manufacturer's existing operational exercises, but also increase the overall customer experience and helps improve financial aspects. Some technology driven service goals are described as follows: G Automate timing/location updates, rate quotes, pick-up scheduling, current transit times, or proof of delivery with interactive voice response (IVR) self-service. G Provide inquiries about updates regarding service and measures the needs of service calls within the system. G Generate and deliver notifications, such as weather alerts, changes in schedules, and more with campaign management tools to alert the respective personnel.

The pretransaction element consists of returns policies, expected delivery time, and contingency plans for problems that may occur during shipment. The expectations are established during the pretransection stage, but it is important for companies to adhere to established policies. The second element of customer service occurs during the transaction stage. This element is very simple. Companies must deliver the right product to the correct location in the prescribed delivery time. Also, the product received must be in good condition. LaLonde and Zinszer identified the third element of customer service as posttransaction activities. These are the services provided to customers following receiving their goods. These activities must be planned in the pretransaction and transaction stages (Ballou, 2004) . These elements are shown graphically in Fig. 8 .3.",

Business sales are related to customer experience and customer satisfaction. The exact relationship between sales and customer service varies by industry and specific business. Generally, when customer service is poor, sales decline. As services increase above the level offered by the competition, sales gain can be expected as superior customer service increases the retention of existing customers and attract new customers. When a firm's customer service level reaches this threshold (level offered by the competition), further service improvement relative to competition can show good sales stimulation. It is possible that service improvements can be carried too far, resulting in no substantial increase of sales.",

There are several theories that conclude that if price and quality are equal a company must offer customer service to approximately the same degree as their competitors in order to maintain competitive advantage in a given market. The service level offering that is offerd by the competition in a market is considered the threshold service level. This threshold service level assumes that a company cannot sustain themselves in any market it they do not offer a base level of customer service greater than or equal to their competitors. Once a company has reached the threshold service level, any improvements above the threshold are expected to stimulate sales.

If there is a deviation of service from the expected or promised targets, there is a potential loss for that service provider, Taguchi's loss function determined that cost penalty (losses) occur at an increasing rate as the level of service deviates from the target value.

Supply chain layers include worldwide retailers who outsource products or services globally, intermediaries such as 3PL/ 4PL, freight forwarder, broker, overseas manufacturers and their sub contractors, and various levels of vendors. These layers are sometime loosely integrated and hence hard to maintain quality throughout the chain. Some layers have quality assurance, but to truly ensure quality products and services, every member of supply chain layers should be considered quality assurance so that the work is done according to specifications. One could say that creates a culture of quality that is ingrain to every layer of the supply chain including an outsourced vendor. Companies may actually decide that in order to meet their quality objectives, some services or products must be outsourced overseas to more skilled laborers. They feel that they do not have the skills in house, and quality is better met by outsourcing the necessary work. A test may be needed on a product and the company may not have the facilities, equipment or the skilled manpower to perform it and therefore they find a company that is more capable and has the facility to perform the test. By that decision, a needed operation is performed and the company's schedule is not interrupted if accurately planned. Steps can be taken to help ensure the vendor provides services and products at quality levels that are acceptable to both internal and external customers. As stated before proper integration of the outsourced work into the supply chain is paramount. No work can properly be accomplished and managed with an integration plan to guide and oversee the vendor's work. If outsourcing is a strong option for the company, but yet there is a lack of trained workers, the company should provide training for the vendors to prepare them for the work that need to be accomplished. The company should also work on the cultural differences between them and the outsourced vendor. They should not seek just to completely change the vendor's way of accomplishing work, but they should strive to understand the vendor's cultural. This will assist in making decisions on how to define requirements to the group and how to help them meet the requirements. U.S. companies should understand that there are different ways at arriving to a solution as long as the requirements are met. In realizing the cultural differences, U.S. companies should make sure the vendor clearly understands what is expected of them. Words that are used in the U.S. may have a totally different meaning to someone in India or China. The company may feel they clearly defined their requirements and the vendor may feel they clearly accomplished the work according the requirements as they read or understood them. Only later, sometimes too late, they find out the product or service did not meet the requirements and the vendor did not clearly understand. A liaison from the parent company should network with a liaison from the vendor who has a clear understanding of the English diction. They will assist in knowing whether the company is effectively providing their requirements to the vendor and the vendor clearly understand what is needed of them. The company should also set up quality metrics that are understood by the vendor and should become a part of the vendor's way of business. In order for quality to become a complete part of the company's supply chain, the outsourced company has to make quality inherit to their business. The company should be able to provide back to the vendor what work is acceptable and what goals are not being met. They should also provide suggestions on how to achieve the required goal. Incentives should be provided to the vendors who continuously provide quality products and product non-confirming vendors should be addressed appropriately, including termination of their services if they continue not to meet the expected quality level.",

Typically, the higher the level of challenge greater is the opportunity for improvement. This is especially true in the case of RL management. Engineering a RL network is fraught with daunting challenges due to the sheer uncertainty that surrounds returns quality, quantity and time. Transporting returned goods is usually difficult and a cumbersome process. Statistically, there are up to 12 times the number of transactions involved in the returns process than to sell the product in the first place, and more require human intervention. For example, an outbound shipment of goods only involves one or two transactions (picking up the goods from a warehouse and delivering them to a small number of locations, or even just one location). However, the process of returning just ten items could mean supply from many locations, plus a different problem resolution per item, and at different times. RL may be an area where companies can gain a sizeable advantage over the competitors. In today's highly competitive economy, high-quality customer services are the tickets to the game. It behooves an organization to differentiate itself from its competitors. In this regard, RL could be one of the major differentiators that organizations can take into account.

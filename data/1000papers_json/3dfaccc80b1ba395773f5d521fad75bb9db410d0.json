It is not known as to how and when can a decision be made to de-isolate these patients to avoid the transmission of the causative virus i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Serial collections of oropharyngeal swab and sputum specimens are recommended by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Taiwan CDC) to detect SARS-CoV-2 from the upper airways in COVID-19 patients. 4 Based on this, we hypothesized that virus detection from the upper airways may have a direct correlation with the possibility of transmission. In this study, we observed the clinical course and presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serial collections of specimens from the upper airways of two patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "According to the previous reports, the presentations were variable for the COVID-19 patients. 8 Patients may be asymptomatic or may present with a mild cough, a fever, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or potentially fatal outcomes. 8 The contagious period of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known. Consequently, it is debatable as to when COVID-19 patients can be de-isolated. We hypothesized that transmission via respiratory droplets is possible when the viruses are detectable in the patients' upper airways. The Taiwan CDC guidelines recommend serial collections of upper airway specimens for detecting the virus. 4 Our observations showed that the wife had more severe symptoms, such as a fever and headache, than the husband, and she received corticosteroid therapy for her hypersensitivity. She had much longer and intermittent virus detections from her upper airway in comparison to her husband. The wife may have had a higher viral load than the husband since she showed severe symptoms. It might also be more difficult for her to achieve virus clearance from the upper airway. Moreover, since she was on corticosteroid therapy, the influence on viral clearance is not known. However, this factor may prolong virus shedding according to other coronavirus observations. 9 Individual immune responses for virus clearance may also influence the results. 10 Furthermore, live viruses are related to true transmission. We do not know whether the positive results of rRT-PCR refer to a persistent infection or to the presence of residual sequences of viral RNA, as we did not perform virus cultures. The Taiwan CDC guidelines have been upgraded to mention that the patients who show three continuous negative results of rRT-PCR from oropharyngeal swabs and sputum (or saliva) specimens from the upper airways can be de-isolated. In this case, we de-isolated the patients on February 28, 2020, based on the three consecutively negative results, 4 Three additional issues have been raised in this report. Firstly, we collected saliva specimens in addition to oropharyngeal swabs of our patients for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Previous studies have mentioned that the SARS-CoV2 was also detected in the saliva of COVID-19 patients and serial saliva viral load monitoring generally showed a declining trend. 6 Saliva is considered a promising non-invasive specimen for diagnosis and monitoring. 6 Secondly, the rRT-PCR results in oropharyngeal swab and saliva samples turned to positive from negative were observed in the wife. This might be due to the variations in quality for sample collection and the viral loads, especially when prior series of samples with high cycle threshold values were noted. Thirdly, our patient was prescribed with diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for headache relief. Diclofenac and ibuprofen are commonly used NSAIDs for pain-relieving agents. A previous study shows that ibuprofen could increase the binding affinity between SARS-COV2 and its target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels, and increased the risk of developing severe illness of COVID-19. 11, 12 Acetaminophen seems to be a better choice than ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory drugs. 12 However, these preliminary observation and speculations need further investigation in the future.",

We see a virion of SARS-CoV-2 whose spike protein has just attached to an ACE-2 receptor of an epithelial cell. To illustrate this process, the scene was roughly sketched by an illustrator. The sketch was then converted into a 3D visualization by using an atomistic model of the virion created by statistical modeling. The scene was then rendered in real-time by an impostor-based molecular visualization algorithm. The virion model is accompanied by the procedurally generated cell membrane populated by lipids and protein molecules. The background, which shows epithelial cells and their cilia, was modeled and rendered in Blender and composed into the visualization to provide the viewers with a context. , particularly involved in studying the genetics of rare immune disorders in the group of Prof. Kaan Boztug. Nowadays she combines her passion for visual thinking and science by working as a freelance science illustrator, trying to bridge the fields of art and education with both traditional and digital media.",

Technology for automatic detection is still under-explored, with few previous works being limited to wearables with single modalities (e.g., motion). Here, we propose a multi-sensory approach combining motion, orientation, and heart rate sensors to detect BFRBs. We conducted a feasibility study in which participants (N=10) were exposed to BFRBs-inducing tasks, and analyzed 380 mins of signals 1 under an extensive evaluation of sensing modalities, cross-validation methods, and observation windows. Our models achieved an AUC > 0.90 in distinguishing BFRBs, which were more evident in observation windows 5 mins prior to the behavior as opposed to 1-min ones. In a follow-up qualitative survey, we found that not only the timing of detection matters but also models need to be context-aware, when designing just-in-time interventions to prevent BFRBs.",

As WHO suggests, mental hygiene (the process of achieving mental health) could be compromised or put at risk, if certain symptoms or behaviors [25] are not diagnosed early and treated, both at an individual and collective level. For example, compulsive behaviors exhibit certain characteristics which may signal poor mental health. In literature, two terms that are interchangeably used to characterize these persistent behaviors are the Body-focused Compulsive Behaviors (BFCB) and the Body-focused Repetitive Behaviors (BFRB); for brevity, we use BFRB throughout the manuscript. These behaviors are repetitive in nature, primarily characterized by the use of hands, and exhibit distinctive behavioral signatures; face-touching, skin-picking, hair-pulling, to name a few, make up the BFRB list. These behaviors, if not identified early and corrected, may lead individuals to damage their physical appearance or, in extreme cases, to cause non-reversible physical damage to themselves [4, 45] . But, more worryingly, they have been linked to the development of severe mental health problems [8] .",

Using consumer-grade wearables (i.e., Samsung Galaxy watches), we obtained 380 minutes of raw signals (i.e., accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate) from 10 users who underwent a series of BFRB-inducing tasks. We make our data set and pre-processing code publicly 3 available to the community ( \u00a75) in an anonymized manner. \u2022 Using the collected data, we performed an in-depth analysis to investigate the feasibility of predicting compulsive behavior using a multisensory approach ( \u00a76). Consistently across all models, we found that the combination of all sensor modalities yielded the best performance ( \u00a77). In particular, we found that generic compulsive behavior (vs. normal) can be predicted with satisfactory discrimination of 0.89 AUC. In specific behaviors such as face touching and skin picking, our models achieved an AUC of 0.94. In addition, compulsive behaviors were more evident in an observation window of 5 minutes prior to the episode as opposed to 1-min window. The short observation windows allow for immediate interventions, while longer ones are more robust in terms of prediction accuracy due to leveraging the multi-sensory approach.",

            "text": "The term body-focused repetitive behavior (BFRBs), coined by Bohne [5] , refers to a set of impulsive behavioral disorders affecting a wide demographic. In this work, we focus on a subset of these behaviors, namely nail-biting, skin-picking, skin-biting, nail-picking, fidgeting, face-touching, and hair-pulling. This subset of behaviors is strongly correlated with clinically recognized body-dysmorphic conditions [14] , and exhibit certain characteristics that can be uniquely identified from single source motion data. Previous research suggests that the most common BFRBs are nail-biting with a prevalence of 34-64%; skinpicking with a prevalence of 25%; and hair pulling with a prevalence of 10.5% [5] . This research was conducted on students from different cultures with comparable results on the prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder. These values suggest a sizeable demographic, further supporting the relevance of the current study. Understanding precise causes and triggers for these behaviors are essential for effective invocation in experiments. Relevant literature also suggests that real-time triggers are correlated to change in environment and, more importantly, stress [5] . Studies concluded, that the behaviors play an emotional regulation role, supported by findings showing these behaviors are triggered by and relieve impatience, boredom, and frustration [30, 32, 46] . In an extended study, clinical approaches to handling emotion regulation are suggested as a method of treatment for BFRBs [31] , with one study showing the pervasive treatment of depression to result in a decrease of body dysmorphic behavior [8] . This correlation between stress and BFRBs inspired the multisensory approach of our study: to combine stress monitoring through the proxy of heart-rate data, as well as motion data for a more accurate preemptive signal for BFRB occurrences.",

Wrist-worn devices have been shown to help accurate inference of multiple conditions and states using ML methods [3, 17, 26, 29, 43] . Previous attempts have been made to detect BFRBs with wearables, however, there is no existing research on the prediction of these behaviors. Azaria [2] developed Thumbs-Up, a wrist-worn device, which is used to infer hand-to-mouth behavior with a 92% accuracy. Lu [22] produced a device for habit detection using a wrist-worn device and machine learning algorithms. Several commercial wearables have also been devised to combat these conditions including the Tingle [38] , Keen 4 , and Pavlok 5 devices. However, among this list, only the Tingle device has published peer-reviewed documentation of their results and proven applicability to BFRB monitoring. This device uses the same sensors (such as in our method) in addition to thermal sensors to detect proximity and position using a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. However, all the above devices provide in-time notifications to the wearer when a BFRB-esque motion is detected, in contrast to our approach focusing on the prediction.",

Therefore, we set out to understand whether these behaviours could be predicted using wearable-sensing data and, if so, how much in advance this could be achieved. To address that, we subsequently formulated three research questions as follows: RQ 1 : Which features among gyroscope, accelerometer, and heart rate are good predictors of BFRBs? RQ 2 : What window sizes prior to BFRBs occurrences allow for reliable anticipation? RQ 3 : To what extent does a multisensory approach (motion and heart rate) improves BFRB prediction?",

Various different lengths of x-windows were also tested (2 to 4 min), which as we shall see in ( \u00a77), results in significantly lower performance compared to 1-or 5-min windows. As stated in Laborde's work [16] , the gold standard in conducting HRV analysis is a 5-min window (we did not include HRV in windows < 5 min). As these windows (< 5 min) do not include HRV, we expect them to rely more on motion than heart data, as with the 1-min windows. However, the motion data was noisier in these windows resulting in lower performance, thus confirming our initial hypothesis.",

The first part consisted of three questions from the Habit Questionnaire [42] that probed BFRBs' presence, severity, and perseverance (Figure 8 A-C) . The second part consisted of three close-ended questions that probed our participant's stress levels in relation to BFRBs, the willingness to receive notifications via a wearable application, and the preferred timing of receiving such notifications (Figure 8 D-F) . Additionally, the second part consisted of two open-ended questions: i) Have any of BFRBs behaviours interfered with your day-to-day activities, and ii) Have any of BFRBs behaviours caused injuries or permanent damage?, which we analyzed through a thematic analysis.",

We also observed that almost all behaviors had been prevalent for over 2 years (Figure 8.B) , suggesting the prolonged severity of these behaviors. Interestingly, all but one participant reported willingness to receive notifications about these behaviors (Figure 8 .F), suggesting a desire to treat them (or, as a first step, create awareness of these behaviors). This also sheds light onto the scenarios in which participants are willing to receive notifications, with 'At home' and 'Alone' being the dominant of options. We also found that only 20% of participants were in favor of the anticipatory notifications, whilst the remaining 80% would opt for just-in-time results (Figure 8 .E).

To contextualize our quantitative findings and understand the role of BFRBs in people's lives, we conducted a thematic analysis on the open-ended questions using a combination of open coding and axial coding [6] . First, we labeled relevant statements in the two open-ended questions of our survey. Second, axial coding was used to identify relationships between concepts and categories that emerged during open coding. Additional emphasis was given on the role of BFRBs in day-to-day activities, the motivations of doing them, and potential harms/injuries that might have caused. We reviewed themes in a recursive manner than linear, and moved between phases as needed, by repeating and re-evaluating themes and coded text as necessary [6] . We found three high-level themes related to: Context of BFRBs, Triggers for BFRBs, and Negative Consequences. Context of BFRBs. The first most prominent theme concerned the context in which BFRBs occur. Many participants stated workplace-related stressors to be the primary context in which these behaviors are performed. P7 stated that \"During a stressful meeting, I start rubbing/touching face\", while P3 linked it to a stressful period during exams (\" I bite my nails in exams and when revising. Face touching is usually done out of boredom but I do rub my forehead in exams. \".",

Interestingly, some participants expressed the habitual nature of these behaviors, and not necessarily linking them with stress (or workplace stress). For example, P8 mentioned that \"I touch my face (and beard) on a regular basis and I don't think it's because of stress or anything. It is the one thing that I constantly do\". The same participant saw certain behaviors as a way of motivation or distraction from an ongoing task (\"Skin picking and fighting [sic] I don't do constantly, there are some periods when I do them and some periods where I don't. It might not be stress-related, but mostly motivation related, as I do them when I feel distracted and (in a sense) don't want to return back to work. Also I do them while I am more lazy/not-working in other settings (e.g. I am waiting for my turn to get in the shower)\"). Negative consequences. The third theme concerned potential harms and injuries that these behaviors cause. While most of our participants did not suffer from very severe self-damage or injuries due to these behaviors, some expressed mild negative consequences. P9 stated that \"sometimes he had calluses, but nothing too damaging\", while P7 had no injuries at all, other than mild \"exacerbating skin issues\".

Higher performances were reported in personalized models, with recalls above 0.8 in certain setups. 1-minute anticipatory window sizes performed best on predicting all-compulsive behaviors, whilst 5-minute models performed consistently throughout each setup when implemented using logistic regression.",

The short 1-minute observation windows allow for immediate interventions, while longer windows of 5-minute are more robust in terms of prediction accuracy. Specifically, we found that, heart rate data in conjunction with motion can be used to anticipate compulsive behavior. Motion being a predictive modality was expected due to the nature of behaviors being linked to stressful situations, however, heart rate data shows more promise when leading up to the occurrences of BFRBs. More importantly, the follow-up survey results suggest our participants' willingness to get notified when such behavior(s) occur.

First, to determine whether our methods could differentiate between the two most prominent behaviors (i.e., skin picking and face touching) an additional experiment was conducted. However, due to the differences in behavior patterns in our data set (Figure 5b) , neither cross-validation method provided satisfactory results. Secondly, the missing RMSSD feature from 1-minute windows, due to heart-rate variability measurement traditionally using 5-minute windows [23] , also inhibits the analysis when comparing different window sizes. However, more recent research suggests some features may be accurately extracted from smaller windows with promising results [35] . We also analyzed different window sizes (2-, 3-, 4-minute), however, the results expectedly decreased as the motion data became noisier whilst still lacking RMSSD data. The third limitation concerns the format of the experiment, resulting in overlapping segments of data from which features were extracted. Finally, the fourth limitation concerns the simulation of real-world use cases. While the user study appropriated real-world scenarios through stress-inducing tasks, our findings should be interpreted under the study's experimental conditions. We acknowledge that presentation and arithmetic tasks might constitute a small fraction of real-world tasks but we think that it fits our set up and study goals. For instance, our study does not account for users on-the-go (e.g., people walking or running), thus is limited to the current experimental setup (i.e., sitting position). Whilst the results indicate our expectations were accurate, future studies would be required to acquire further evidence for the prediction of these compulsive behaviors.",

The intensity of behaviors is also excluded, but could be used to add additional labels. Further studies would include more participants, potentially even filtering for certain behaviors allowing for more fine-grained tuning. Future work would also extend data gathering to include a free-living study to comprise a larger data set, with greater focus on the potential of personalized models. Scaling the study to support tailored models of participants would be straightforward as calibration only requires a 5-minute baseline reading from the user to begin with. Labeling would be conducted through a combination of both inference and participant feedback to ensure the validity of data gathered from unobserved environments.",

            "text": "Body-focused repetitive behaviors like face-touching or skin-picking are characterized primarily by the use of hands. While there is an abundance of medical evidence on the importance and severity of these behaviors (particularly if not early identified and corrected), there is yet dearth of empirical exploration of these behaviors using consumer-grade wearables. We conducted a feasibility study in which participants were exposed to a series of tasks that induced BFRBs. By analyzing a total of 380 minutes of raw signals under an extensive evaluation of sensor modalities, cross-validation methods, observation windows, and machine learning classifiers, we found that BFRBs can be predicted with sufficient accuracy. In particular, generic compulsive behavior (vs. normal) achieves 89.2 AUC, face touching 94.4 AUC, and skin picking 94 AUC. Across most models, using an observation window of 5 minutes prior to the episode outperformed the 1 minute one and, notably, the heart sensors were stronger predictors in the former while the motion sensors dominated in the latter. These findings are a fundamental step towards creating awareness of one's BFRBs (given the recent re-emergence of face touching as a public health risk for infectious diseases), and designing just-in-time interventions to prevent them.",

Access to traditional in-person healthcare can be difficult for some under usual conditions and has become a ubiquitous barrier throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth, defined as the 'delivery of healthcare at a distance using information and communication technology' is a solution to many access barriers and has been rapidly adopted by many healthcare professions throughout the crisis. While significant advancements in technology has made the widespread adoption of telehealth feasible, there are many factors to be considered when implementing a telehealth service.",

Despite these recommendations, the timely, affordable and equitable access to such healthcare services can be severely limited for some. Traditionally these access barriers are associated with geographical issues due to a significantly reduced health workforce capacity in regional and remote communities (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2013). However access barriers are not only the result of geographical isolation (Cottrell et al., 2017) , with an indisputable example being the strict social distancing policies initiated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This has demanded organisations to rethink how traditional healthcare services can be delivered with many services rapidly adopting telehealth service delivery methods.The objectives of this masterclass are to (i) introduce the reader to telehealth and outline the current research within the context of musculoskeletal conditions; (ii) provide insights into why the adoption of telehealth into routine clinical practice has been slow to date; and (iii) to describe a systematic approach, along with practical considerations, that can be used to successfully implement telehealth into an existing healthcare setting. This approach is relevant to both the establishment of a long term, sustainable telehealth service and for the rapid implementation of telehealth during the COVID-19 crisis.",

The use of telehealth has also been shown to increase exercise adherence for a variety of musculoskeletal conditions (Bennell et al., 2019; Lambert et al., 2017) .

The primary barrier often cited from an organizational perspective is the cost of implementing telehealth services. This includes not only the initial financial outlay in obtaining necessary ICT infrastructure (Moffatt & Eley, 2011) but also the lack of reimbursement that healthcare services across many countries receive for telehealth consultations (Kruse et al., 2018; Ross et al., 2016) . The advancement of affordable consumer-grade technology (both hardware and software applications) and data (Internet) coverage throughout the world in recent years negates the need for expensive bespoke ICT infrastructure, while advocacy from professional bodies, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, has supported the reimbursement of telehealth services by numerous funding bodies (McDonald, 2020) .

            "text": "The vast majority of literature investigating the barriers to telehealth adoption has however focused on the perspective of the clinician, where Wade et al. (2014) acknowledges that clinician acceptance is a primary determinant in the success or failure of a telehealth service. Factors such as resistance to changing clinical practice (Brewster et al., 2013) , poor technological self-efficacy (Kruse et al., 2018) , perceived de-personalization of care (Green et al., 2016) and patient privacy and safety concerns (Mair et al., 2008) have been cited as key barriers to clinician acceptance towards telehealth. This is most likely due to the additional skills that are required of clinicians to be able to deliver care safely and effectively via this alternative medium. Telehealth requires the clinician to be somewhat reliant on the patient to provide information that may be normally derived from general observation or the physical 'hands-on' examination (Hinman et al., 2017) . As such, clinicians need to be technologically competent in navigating the chosen telehealth software (i.e. videoconferencing) platform while also adapting existing clinical knowledge and communication skills. These adaptive processes can be further challenged by both the physical environment in which the patient is located (e.g. small, clutter space) and the event of technical disruptions during the consultation. As such, telehealth can lead to a 'power-shift' in the empirical roles of the clinician and patient (Hinman et al., 2017) , which may contribute to clinician resistance and poor acceptance. With this in mind, there needs to be recognition of the complex and often implicit processes that take place when clinicians are first exposed to telehealth. Specific training and upskilling of clinicians to provide care via telehealth is paramount to ensure a sustainable telehealth service, with more recent studies demonstrating that clinician acceptance and confidence does improve with both direct training and repeated exposure .",

Even with the best of intentions and a genuine need, many telehealth services do not thrive due to a lack of stakeholder readiness. For example, an audit of existing patients (particularly those identified as having challenges in accessing the service) should be undertaken to determine if they have access to an Internet-enabled computer device and are willing to engage in this alternative method of service delivery. From an organizational perspective a robust business case should be developed early in order to ensure long-term financial sustainability of the telehealth model. As such, a readiness assessment can assess the feasibility of telehealth within the context of a specific service or organization, and thereby help improve the chances of successful implementation.

A systematic approach offering practical suggestions has been described to support the successful and sustainable adoption of telehealth as part of routine clinical service delivery.

To clarify the coupling mechanism between this disease and economy, a new dynamical system is established. It is theoretically proved that the basic reproduction number is a nonlinear combination of parameters regarding disease transmission, intervention and economy effect, which totally determines the stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria. Further results indicate the existence of interaction and mutual restraint among the transmission, intervention and economy, in which strong coupling of COVID-19 and economy would trigger disease outbreak and form poverty trap, while adaptive isolation of at-risk population could effectively reduce morbidity at the cost of least economic loss. Our findings can offer new insights to improve the intervention strategies against COVID-19.",

Non-pharmaceutical interventions mainly focus on social distancing, including travel restrictions, quarantine of patients, closure of schools and workplaces, suspension of public transportation, and wearing masks. Such strategies are playing significant roles in reducing the morbidity and mortality [3] , and at the same time, they directly/indirectly hinder economic development [4] . For example, Hubei's GDP shrank by 39.2% in the first quarter compared with the previous one. It is estimated that the reduction in GDP range from 4% under alert level 1 up to 37% under level 4 in New Zealand [5] . Hence, in the face of COVID-19, it is of great significance to balance the relationship between economy and public health, which can help more effectively mitigate the disease burden with less economic loss.",

Since the occurrence of COVID-19, many mathematical models were established aiming at predicting propagation trends [8] , tracing transmission patterns [9] , estimating infection risk [10] , and evaluating intervention effects [11] .

The corresponding transfer flowchart of the model is shown in Figure 1 . The dynamics of COVID-19 and economy are inexorably linked. First, the working environment and living conditions will be improved through economic growth, which can further reduce the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Second, economic growth will make the treatment measures more standardized and perfect, which can further shorten the time of treatment and recovery. The economic growth model here is modelled using the Logistic equation [12] , where COVID-19 patients and quarantine people could not work, so GDP growth will be constrained by COVID-19 epidemic.

            "text": "The model framework is activated by concrete parameters with biological background, which allows for further digging the dynamical interactions between COVID-19 and economic growth. The time unit of the parameters is per month or month. According to data of China's National Bureau of Statistics in 2019, the GDP per capita (g 0 ) and the birth/death rate are respectively adopted to be 5908 RMB and 0.0011 (with life expectancy as 76.34 years). It is estimated from the China's GDP curve that the coefficient \u03b8 is 4.40 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . The basic reproduction numbers contributed by individuals in incubation and infected states are specified as r 1 = 0.4 and r 2 = 2.68 [8] . The mean incubation period 1/\u03b7 is 1/6 [13] . Based on the epidemiology survey, the time span from illness onset to be treated and the shortest period of treatment are estimated to be 1/\u03b4 = 0.2 and 1/\u03b3 = 1/3, respectively. In simulations, the proportions of humans in different states being quarantined and the weighting coefficient of economic effect are variable. It is imposed that the initial values of GDP per capita equals the positive equilibrium in case of no infection. Figure 2 shows the effects of different coupling weight coefficient on the evolutions of COVID-19 and economy. It is found that when infectivity weight of GDP (k 1 and k 2 ) increase from 0 to 6000, the basic reproduction number R 0 will increase from 0.10 to 1.55. That is, large coupling weights between the infectivity and economy may easily trigger the outbreak of COVID-19, which would formulate a poverty trap. It is further observed that (1) when R 0 < 1, the incidence declines directly and rapidly, and GDP per capita increases slowly until stabilizes; (2) When R 0 > 1, followed by a sharp rise, the incidence quickly reach an peak and then keep stable in very low level. At the same time, the GDP per capita falls rapidly and increase gradually to a stable level. It is clear that the outbreak of COVID-19 causes damage to economic growth, and it will take over ten years for economy to recover. It should be noted that the treatment weight coefficient of GDP (k 3 ) could not work on R 0 and the incidence. Yet large k 3 means that the treatment cycle is much longer, which would leads to lower level of economic growth. Figure 3 displays the restrictive relationships of COVID-19 and economy in case of implementing quarantine measures with different intensity. It is found that both of constant and adaptive isolation can work on COVID-19 control and economic situation, in which some interesting patterns are observed: (1) Adaptive isolation could be more effective in decreasing morbidity, but it also prolongs the epidemic in very low prevalence rate; (2) Isolating susceptible individuals would greatly damage economic growth and could slightly release infection burden; (3) Adaptively isolating the people in latent and infected states not only can effectively reduce incidence rate, but also minimize 5 .

Furthermore, the growth rate of GDP per capita (\u03b8), and the maximum income in absence of disease (g 0 ), as well as the isolation rates (q i ) are negatively associated with R 0 , indicating that economic development and quarantine strategies can significantly reduce infection risk. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

            "text": "In this paper, a new dynamical model is developed for coupling the transmission, intervention of COVID-19 and economic growth. Mathematical analysis verifies that the basic reproduction number R 0 is the sharp threshold to determine the outbreak of the disease. The value of R 0 greatly depends on intrinsic transmissibility (e.g., infection rate, incubation period, and infected period) , coupling weight, and intervention strategies (e.g., early detection and treatment, quarantine). The results indicate that there is a mutual restraining mechanism between COVID-19 transmission and economic growth. Strong impact of economy on COVID-19 infection would trigger disease outbreak and raise morbidity, and it also hold back economic progress, resulting in a poverty trap. In this case, providing financial assistance for attacking areas or patients can release the connection between infection and economy loss, which could help to escape the poverty trap stemmed from COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, implementing quarantine measures can help to contain the propagation of COVID-19, but its impact on economy is inconsistent. Isolating healthy people would damage economy. While adaptively isolating those people in latent and infected states as many as possible is best for both sides, which can greatly reduce human infection and yields a minimal impact on economic development. That requires timely detection and isolation of those persons at risk (e.g., the people who once contact with patient or has been to infected regions), and guarantees that healthy persons can work in safe environment. The results can provide scientific theoretical reference for COVID-19 epidemic control and policy formulation.",

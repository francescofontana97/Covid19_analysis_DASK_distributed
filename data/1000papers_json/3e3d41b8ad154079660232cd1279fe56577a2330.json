The main outcome measures were the number of computed tomography (CT) angiography, CT perfusion, large vessel occlusions (defined according to the automated software detection), and severe strokes on CT perfusion (defined as those with hypoperfusion volumes >70 mL) normalized as number of patients per day per hospital. Data from the prepandemic (November 4, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and pandemic (March 1 to May 10, 2020) periods were compared at national and state levels.

[1] [2] [3] [4] Although a causal association between stroke and COVID-19 is highly plausible, the majority of patients who may require care for acute stroke during the COVID-19 outbreak are unlikely to be infected with SARS-CoV2, and yet the social, psychological, and health care impact of the pandemic seems to indirectly affect even those patients with stroke not infected by the virus. Indeed, an increasing number of reports describe dramatic reductions in stroke admissions, delays in hospital arrival times, and significant declines in the rates of intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy (MT) across broad geographic locations. 2, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] See related article, p 1691",

The system is based on a proprietary artificial intelligence convolutional neural network that automates neuroimaging processing and interpretation. The clinical tool consists of a HIPAA-compliant mobile interactive module encompassing (1) a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine viewer, (2) a communication system including text messaging and audiovideo calling capabilities, (3) an artificial intelligence algorithm that automatically identifies suspected large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes on computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) and triggers an alert to the on-call team, and (4) a second artificial intelligence algorithm that automatically analyzes CT perfusion (CTP) images using motion correction, artifacts rejection, and arterial input function/venous output function extraction to build an imaging output based on deconvolution models. The CTP outputs include threshold-based maps for relative cerebral blood flow, relative cerebral blood volume, and time-to-maximum of the residue function. Baseline predicted infarct core volume is calculated based on the relative cerebral blood flow <30% threshold (relative to the mean contrast concentration on the contralateral side) and hypoperfused tissue at risk is calculated based on time-to-maximum of the residue function >6 seconds. Perfusion mismatch is defined in both relative and absolute terms based on the ratio and absolute difference between the time-to-maximum of the residue function >6 seconds and relative cerebral blood flow <30% lesion volumes, respectively. 12 Following standard imaging acquisition, Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine data are transmitted to the server for cloud-based processing, and the generated output is shared with the clinical teams via a mobile application. In parallel, an automated deidentification process creates an anonymous patient identifier and removes any protected health information. The deidentified output along with its associated metadata (including patient's age and sex as well as date, time, and site of image acquisition) is subsequently transferred to Viz Analytics, a clinical intelligence platform comprised of a data warehouse containing a software package that empowers large data analysis in real time.",

Specifically, comparisons were made to assess the ability of the proportional changes in the number of overall CTAs, LVOs on CTA, and severe strokes on CTP on the Viz system to predict changes in the number of stroke admissions and MT procedures at the CSCs. Finally, we assessed at the relationship between CTAs/hospital per day versus the number of overall COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths per 1 000 000 at each state as an attempt to explore whether or not the heterogeneity of COVID-19 incidence across the different states could have impacted our results. LVO strokes on CTA were defined according to the automated software detection. Severe strokes on CTP were defined as those with hypoperfusion lesion volumes >70 mL. The prepandemic and pandemic periods were defined using March 1, 2020, the day that New York City, the US epicenter of the pandemic, reported its first COVID-19 hospitalization, as the cutoff date. We hypothesized that, given the pandemic-related psychosocial impact on the population and overall burden on the systems of health care, (1) a significant decline would be seen in imaging stroke screening across the 2 periods, (2) this would more prominently affect the milder strokes but would still affect patients with the more severe presentations (ie, LVO and hypoperfusion deficits >70 mL), (3) as patients would be potentially arriving in a delayed manner, the infarct volumes would be higher and the mismatch volumes/ratios would be lower across the 2 epochs, (4) the age and sex distribution of the decline would potentially differ.",

Therefore, we could not substantiate the hypothesis that more patients presented to stroke centers with imaging patterns suggestive of delayed hospital arrival. Notably, the findings about stroke presentation times during the pandemic have been controversial. In fact, some reports have demonstrated a relative preservation of prehospital workflow times despite significant reductions in overall stroke volumes and rates of reperfusion treatments. This has been described even in some of the epicenters of the disease including Barcelona and France. 2, 5 In contrast, significant delays in presentation times have been reported in other systems. [7] [8] [9] 14 These discrepancies might simply reflect regional variations in prehospital workflow over the course of the outbreak. Conspicuously, South Carolina demonstrated marked decreases in the absolute mismatch volumes in both patients with severe strokes on CTP (\u221228.1%; P=0.01) and LVO on CTA (\u221236.2%; P=0.24) in the face of a concurrent report showing longer times to hospital arrival in the region. 9 This finding supports the concept that big data imaging surveillance may potentially allow for the early identification of workflow problems. The significantly younger age seen in male patients with LVO could theoretically reflect a greater hesitation from elderly male patients to seek medical care in face of their higher vulnerability to COVID-19 or possibly represent a byproduct of the strokes directly related to the SARS-CoV2 infection, which tend to affect younger patients.

Both reports used the volumes of imaging screening as a surrogate for the amount of care provided, an assumption that was corroborated by the sampling of the State of Georgia where similar declines were seen across the number of LVOs detected by the Viz system at all (primary and comprehensive) stroke centers and the number of MTs performed. Additionally, similar declines were observed across the numbers of LVOs on CTA and severe strokes on CTP at all centers versus CSCs hospital admissions.

Therefore, it likely underestimated the total LVOs by failing to compute vertebrobasilar occlusions and some of the more distal middle cerebral artery LVOs (ie, distal M2s). Details about stroke onset time and clinical severity are not available. Magnetic resonance imaging selection was not included in the study and it is known that diffusion weighted imaging provides more reliable quantification of infarct size/severity than CTP.

When comparing the prepandemic to the pandemic time frame, statistically significant decreases were seen in the number of both CTAs (relative change: \u221222.8%; 1.39-1.07 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001; Figure 1) and CTPs (\u221226.1%; 0.50-0.37 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001). The incidence of LVO in the study population decreased by 17.1% (0.15-0.13 patients/ day per hospital, P<0.001). Likewise, there was a 16.7% reduction in the proportion of patients presenting with severe strokes on CTP (0.12-0.10 patients/day per hospital, P<0.005) and a 21.6% decline in the proportion of patients presenting with both LVO on CTA and severe strokes on CTP (0.051-0.040 patients/day per hospital, P=0.009; Table 1). More substantial declines were seen across patients with the milder imaging patterns on both CTA (non-LVO versus LVO: \u221223.6% versus \u221217.1%, P<0.005) and CTP (hypoperfusion deficit \u226470 versus >70 mL: \u221227.0% versus \u221216.7%, P<0.005). In general, no significant age differences were seen across the 2 study periods; the median (IQR) age in the prepandemic versus pandemic period was 67 (54-78) versus 67 (55-77) years (P=0.10) for the overall patients and 71 (59-83) versus 70 (58-81) years (P=0.11) for patients with LVO, respectively. However, when categorizing age by sex, male LVO patients were significantly younger in the pandemic epoch (66 [56-77] versus 69 [58-80] years, P=0.03). There were no significant changes in the median volumes for ischemic core (+81.8%; 3.3 [0.0-31.48] versus 6.0 [0.0-36.75] mL, P=0.46), hypoperfusion (+7.7%; 46.9 [0.23-138.4] versus 50.5 [1.0-134.75] mL, P=1.0) and absolute mismatch (\u22121.25%; 31.9 [0.03-95.5] versus [31.5 1.0-85.75] mL, P=0.56) in patients with LVO across the study periods. However, patients with LVO demonstrated a significant reduction in mismatch ratio (\u221223.3%; 6.0 [2.24-nan] versus 4.6 [2.01-infinite], P<0.001).

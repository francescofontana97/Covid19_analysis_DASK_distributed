We derive the expression for the potential of global invasion of the epidemic that depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the transportation network and mobility features, the demographic profile and the mixing pattern. Higher assortativity in the contact pattern greatly increases the probability of spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneous features of the mobility network characterizing its topology and traffic flows strongly favor the invasion of the pathogen at the spatial level, as also a larger fraction of children traveling.

Two aspects emerging from surveillance and serological data during the initial phase of the outbreak became strikingly clear: (i) international movements of passengers by air travel drove the spatial dissemination of the pathogen at the global level [1] [2] [3] , and (ii) initial local epidemics mainly occurred in schools [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] . Country surveillance data from summer 2009 [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] show a dramatic difference in the age distributions of imported cases and indigenous cases, with imported cases on average older than the ones generated by local transmission (see Figure 1A ). This result strengthens the previous observations and highlights the presence of an age shift between the seeding events established by travelers from affected areas -mainly adults -and the local outbreaks mainly occurring among school-aged children. Travel statistics indeed confirm that the vast majority of passengers flying are aged \u2265 18 years (see Figure 1B ). The role of children or adults in driving a major epidemic can be assessed with a simplified modeling approach expressed into two age classes and quantifying the probability of temporary extinction of seed individuals in each class depending on their mixing patterns [14] . Here we aim at fully addressing the interplay between the two factors emerged as empirical evidence during the initial outbreak of H1N1 pandemicnamely, age-specific seeding events and age-specific epidemic dynamics -by considering a spatially explicit model that integrates the mobility patterns of flights connecting different populated areas, as well as age-dependent travel behavior in addition to age-specific mixing. We introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model that includes heterogeneous features in: the spatial structure of the population; the travel behavior of individuals depending on their age; the corresponding mixing patterns. We assume a simple two age-groups classification as this allows the analytical treatment of the model to obtain the expression of the conditions for a major epidemic in terms of the age-specific contacts and travel features. By exploring theoretical contact matrices with varying assortativity levels (i.e. within-group mixing), we assess the role of assortativity on the risk of a major epidemic and compare it to scenarios informed with estimates from the H1N1 pandemic. We find that the assortativity observed in real data tend to drive the system to extinction, and is counterbalanced by the heterogeneity of the air mobility network structure, by the travel behavior of adults and by the relative proportion of contacts established by adults, all aspects that favor the virus spread.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 436, "end": 439, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 440, "end": 443, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 444, "end": 447, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 510, "end": 513, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 514, "end": 517, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 518, "end": 521, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 522, "end": 525, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 526, "end": 529, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 575, "end": 578, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 579, "end": 582, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 583, "end": 587, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 588, "end": 592, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 593, "end": 597, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 598, "end": 602, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1433, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 783, "end": 792, "text": "Figure 1A", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1158, "text": "Figure 1B", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Through a systematic exploration of the role of the various ingredients considered in the system, the presented results allow the risk assessment analysis of a specific epidemic scenario and can be extended to other infectious diseases where the population partition may play a relevant role.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "We consider a metapopulation framework to simulate the spread of an infectious disease across subpopulations of individuals through mobility connections.

It is important to note that, besides the threshold condition * > 1, the absolute value of the estimator * provides a quantitative indication of the effective reduction that needs to be reached through public health interventions in order to bring * below its threshold value, i.e. the difference * \u2212 1.

Here we study a situation in which = 0, i.e. only adults travel, in order to isolate the effect of changes in the local transmission while neglecting the role of children in the mobility process. The rectangle shown in the panels indicates the ranges of the country values for and in Europe. A variation of from the smallest to the largest of the country values produces a stronger effect on * with respect to a variation of within the European range. As such, represents an important source of country heterogeneity in the epidemic outcome, as already discussed. The two panels differ for the value of the reproductive number considered that takes into account the effective reduction in the transmission potential observed during school holidays (panel A, corresponding to = 1.05) with respect to school term (panel B, = 1.4). These values are estimated for the UK on the basis of contact data for the country in the two periods [36], as illustrated in detail in the Methods section, and here we generalize this result to all countries under study to provide a comparison between school opening and school closure in terms of the predicted risk of a major outbreak. During school holiday period (panel A), European countries are found to be close to the critical level, with a portion of the parameter space for Europe in the extinction region, thus confirming the results presented before regarding variations in the country-specific risks of major epidemics.

Such results would be particularly important when considering the country where a new epidemic may emerge, as predictions obtained from previous works considering hypothetical seeding countries would be hardly applicable if demographic features are different. National preparedness plans may be informed by country-specific recommendations through the present approach, and an extensive exploration of the model's results in terms of classes of demographic and contact pattern features would help in providing more general insights on classes of seeding scenarios.

Differently from these numerical approaches that can describe the geotemporal propagation of the infectious disease in the population, our model does not provide any temporal information on the epidemic unfolding in that all dynamical aspects are synthetically summarized in a branching process leading to the condition for global invasion. On the other hand, given the importance of demographic profiles, mixing patterns and age-specific travel resulting from the present study, it would be important to further extend large-scale spatial transmission computational models to include such features. While computationally feasible, the main limitation nowadays is represented by the availability of mixing data and travel behavior for a large set of countries, given a global level objective. This further supports the need to have multiple modeling frameworks that can complement each other in providing important information to characterize an emerging epidemic and its associated risks and impact.Finally, we note that changes in time of population behavior as a response to the ongoing outbreak cannot be dynamically incorporated in the model. These may refer for example to changes in the contact patterns due to self-awareness or changes at the community level due to the implementation of intervention strategies to control the epidemic[49,[69][70][71][72][73]. On the other hand, these scenarios can be separately studied with the model, assuming each of these features to be constant in time, in order to assess the effect of such changes on the corresponding risk of a major epidemic. As possible application examples we provided model predictions for different mixing patterns related to school terms and school holidays during H1N1 pandemic, as well as uniform travel restrictions that may result from self-impositions, national guidelines or travel bans.Future studies will focus on other historical epidemics, like e.g. the case of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, in order to explore which mechanisms, among the ones included in this approach and related to the applied interventions or to individual's self-adaptation, hindered a fully global transmission of the disease.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF13": {"text": "Schematic example of different assortativity levels in mixing patterns.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF14": {"text": "Final size, extinction probability, and global invasion threshold vs. .

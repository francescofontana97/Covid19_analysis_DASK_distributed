            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak placed tremendous and unprecedented pressure on the health care system worldwide, stretching it beyond its capacities (Carter & May, 2020; Ripp et al., 2020) . Recent studies on health care workers report high levels of psychological stress and anxiety (Mazza et al., 2020; Montemurro, 2020) , psychosomatic symptoms, and higher risk of burnout (Sasangohar et al., 2020) during the COVID-19 epidemic worldwide, although their extent differs (e.g. Italy: Rossi et al., 2020; Spain: Luce\u00f1o-Moreno et al., 2020; Great Britain: Hunter et al., 2020; China: Cai et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; USA: Shechter et al., 2020) . For instance, in the study by Rossi et al. (2020) among Italian Health workers, severe depression, anxiety and high perceived stress were reported respectively by 24.73%, 19.8% and 21.90% respondents. Luce\u00f1o-Moreno et al. (2020) , in their study among health workers in Spain, report that 58.6% suffered anxiety disorder, 46% depressive disorder and 41.1% feel emotionally drained. In the study by Shechter et al. (2020) among USA health workers at a large medical center in New York City, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and acute stress were reported respectively by 48%, 33% and 7% of the respondents. The study by Du et al. (2020) found that 12.7%, 20.1% and 59% of Chinese health workers in Wuhan had, respectively, at least mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, and moderate to severe levels of perceived stress. Differences related to the different exposure to the health emergency (e.g. work load, overload of the intensive care units, physical and psychological support received) and to methodological differences (e.g. instruments, sample, modalities of recruitment) may explain the different extent of psychological distress reported by the studies. Similar psychosocial impacts were reported during highly contagious diseases such as the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003 (Avendano et al., 2003; Masur et al., 2003) and, most recently, the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa in 2014 and 2015 (Lehmann et al., 2016) . Worries about becoming infected, fear of death, increase in hygienic and avoidance behaviors, limited resources, longer shifts, disruptions to sleep and to work-life balance, and occupational hazards associated with exposure to contagious are among the factors cited to explain physical and mental fatigue, stress and anxiety and burnout among health workers (Adams and Walls, 2020) .",

Kang et al. (2020) found that health workers express a greater need to obtain help from professionals than from close family and friends, either to alleviate acute mental health disturbances or to improve their physical health. Furthermore, the authors found that clinical personnel who had serious psychological problems, compared to less severely affected groups, had accessed fewer printed psychological advice materials (e.g. office brochures) and less psychological guidance publicised through digital media. Previous responses to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) show that medical staff tend to believe that measures such as adopting strict infection control, providing PPE and offering practical guidance help protect their mental health (Khalid et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "Italian health workers were among the first to face the health emergency in a period of great uncertainty about the virus and ways to treat patients and avoid infection. On 31 January 2020, the first two confirmed cases of infection due to COVID-19 were reported in Rome. The expansion of the COVID-19 outbreak began in Lombardy, in northern Italy, and spread throughout the country after about one month (Santacroce et al., 2020) The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of Italian health workers has been little explored. Recent studies report high depression symptoms in a percentage of Italian health workers ranged from 24,73% to 32,8%, high anxiety in a percentage from 19,80%-18.7%, high perceived stress from 8.27% to 27.2% (Mazza et al., 2020; Rossi et al., 2020) . Italian frontline health workers have been exposed to a persistent source of distress related to a high workload, as well as inadequate devices and supplies to carry out their professional intervention. There have been too few places available in healthcare facilities for the number of patients in critical condition, insufficient human resources, a chronic shortage of healthcare workers, overcrowding in intensive care units, with some patients dying at home while awaiting admission, a concrete risk of being forced to treat only those with a better prognosis, inadequate information on the contagion, insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves and masks, and a paucity of psychological support (Carenzo et al., 2020; Khanna et al., 2020; Paterlini, 2020) . This happened within a health system already suffering from a progressive decrease in resources allocated. Today, Italy is below the average for both total health expenditure per capita (USD 3428 vs USD 3980) and public expenditure (USD 2545 vs USD 3038), ahead of only the Eastern European countries and Spain, Portugal and Greece [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), updated 10 September 2020].",

The degree of correspondence between the distances between points implied by the MDS map and the matrix input is measured (inversely) by a stress function.

Although the cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow us to state that the perceived symptoms and malaise were an effect of the COVID-19 emergency, the findings mirror those of recent studies on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on frontline health workers from other countries (e.g. China: Cai et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020 ; Spain: (Avendano et al., 2003; Masur et al., 2003; Maunder et al., 2003) . High workload, disruptions to work-life balance, as well as occupational hazards associated with exposure to COVID-19 are commonly recognised factors which may play a principal role in the psychological distress among frontline medical and nursing staff. About one fifth of our sample had experienced contagion personally or through a family member whom they live with and had experienced mandatory quarantine; more than half had experienced the infection of a patient or a colleague. This comes in a period of very high uncertainty about the virus and ways to treat patients and avoid infection, and a lack of general guidelines. Consistently with hypothesis 1, correlation analysis shows significant relations between measures of emotional distress and psychosomatic symptoms. Although this kind of analysis does not allow one to determine the direction of the association, it is plausible that a circular linkage exists. In their analysis of the impact of the current pandemic on mental health, Xiang et al. (2020) observed that high, uncontrolled stress affected the autonomic nervous system and cortex, potentially leading to psychosomatic and somatic symptoms, which in turn affect psychological problems. Somatic symptoms are hypothesised to represent a way of communicating emotions (Kleinman, 1997 ) and a consequence of automatic stress responses (Cavallo et al., 2014; Polmann et al., 2019) , as found also in previous studies during the COVID-19 pandemic (Almeida-Leite et al., 2020) and SARS (Lam et al., 2009) . Many factors may contribute to the expression of psychological distress via physical symptoms, such as professional role (i.e. the need to not manifest discouragement towards patients, colleagues and loved ones), the social-cultural milieu (i.e. the interpretation of health workers as \"heroes\" committed to saving the nation, which was dominant in the discourses of politicians and journalists) (Cassandro, 2020; Hsin and Macer, 2004; Venuleo et al., 2020a) and social stigma associated with mental health issues among health workers (Chew et al., 2020) .",

Findings show that more than half of our sample considered themselves not at all or poorly protected by the national government, as well as not at all or poorly protected by their local health agency; the percentage is slightly lower (about 45%) in the case of the regional administration. Almost 50% of respondents judged the emotional support received inadequate; almost 30% rated the safety and hygiene measures received as insufficient. The words most used to describe unsatisfied needsprotection, support and personal protection devicesoffer a clear picture of the unfulfilled expectations of frontline health workers, highlighting the paradoxical circumstances of being called to safeguard people's health in the absence of personal physical and psychological protection.",

            "text": "Consistent with hypothesis 2, the findings show that physical and psychological pressure and distress were significantly related to a perceived lack of institutional responses. Specifically, the less the perceived support by the institution (at the level of government, regional administration and local health agency), the higher the probability of experiencing somatic symptoms such as joint pain, headaches, stomach or bowel problems, difficulty falling asleep and bruxism. Furthermore, the less the perceived adequacy of hygiene and safety measures, the higher the likelihood of psychosomatic symptoms as well as a perceived worsening of physical and psychological health in the previous three months. One may suppose that a lack of hygiene and safety measures exposed health workers to greater fear of being infected and to the feeling of being alone, as further sources of distress. As observed, dissatisfaction with the support received was related significantly to somatic measures, more so than to emotional exhaustion or negative affect. It is plausible that negative feelings toward institutions at different levels (government, regional administration, local health systems) solicited psychological conflicts (e.g. between their roles as health care providers and parents with related fear and guilt about potentially exposing their families to infection; see Maunder et al., 2003) that were difficult to represent to themselves due to their identification with the institutional mission to \"save the nation\", as \"heroes\"; a message which strongly characterized institutional and media discourses (Cassandro, 2020) . This could also be attributed to the fact that somatization offers the most socially expedient way of communicating distress and dissatisfaction (Kleinman, 1997) . Another compatible explanation is that the perceived inadequacy of institutional responses exacerbated concerns related to their somatic symptoms; as suggested by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (2020), some somatic symptoms are similar to those of COVID-19 infectione.g. gastrointestinal symptomsand may lead people to suspect that they are infected.",

Emotional exhaustion was higher among medical and nursing staff working in low risk zones than those in high risk zones. A different result was found in the study of Yuan et al. (2020) , showing a significant difference between the group from Hubei Province and the non-endemic provinces in China during the COVID-19 epidemic regarding the degree of anxiety around becoming infected. Our finding is not obvious, but it is understandable. Indeed, if on one hand health workers working in a high risk zone were exposed to greater overwork due to the higher incidence of the coronavirus infection, on the other handbased on our findingsthey were also more satisfied with the protection measures received. It is not surprising, considering the historical differences of economic resources which characterize Northern Italythe high risk zones, and the low risk zone of Southern Italy, which received also a limited supply of equipment, masks and protective suits for hospitals in the first months of the health emergency. From this perspective, the result is consistent with the idea that the psychological impact of the COVID-19 emergency can be strongly influenced by contextual aspects such as institutional outbreak responses (Venuleo et al., 2020b) , calling for a critical reflection on the common representation of a pandemic as a disruptive event that can only produce a disruptive health impact. People's vulnerability is not due only to the natural hazard but is also constructed by social, economic and political conditions (See: Cannon and M\u00fcller-Mahn, 2010) . As advocated by the World Health Organization (2020) and several scholars (e.g. Ripp et al., 2020; Sim, 2020) , institutional responses can play an essential role in preventing psychological and physical problems related to a pandemic crisis among the population and specific vulnerable groups, such as health workers. Duan and Zhu (2020) noted that during lockdown measures, clinical psychiatrists, psychologists and mental health social workers were considered \"not essential\" personnel and were strongly discouraged from entering isolation wards. This also happened in Italy, where psychological or support health services were interrupted, and offered on the basis of volunteers and local initiatives. Institutions made efforts to protect citizens and to gather and develop the structural and technical resources needed to manage the health emergency (e.g. new doctors and nurses, hospital beds), but marginalised the psychological side of health (Castiglioni and Gaj, 2020) and the impact on it of factors such as work and responsibility overload, grief over the death of patients, fear for their own health and that of their loved ones, and the dilemma of whether to apply for medical leave of absence, or to continue working during this critical period .",

Second, the cross-sectional design of the study does not allow definitive statements about the relationships between institutional responses and emotional distress and psychosomatic symptoms during the pandemic. Third, the use of self-reported data may be influenced by recall bias and answer accuracy. However, one can argue that, even if unable to offer an objective description of psychological and physical health of frontline medical and nursing staff, self-report measures allow them to detect their perceptions and evaluations of their own health; therefore, they can indicate distress which needs to be seriously considered. Finally, further studies are needed to investigate the role of respondents' psychosocial conditions in moderating or mediating the impact of the institutional responses on the target measures of wellbeing: e.g. the different life situations and the related specific challenges imposed by the pandemic.",

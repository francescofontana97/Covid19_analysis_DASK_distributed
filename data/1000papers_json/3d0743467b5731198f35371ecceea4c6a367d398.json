It defines health and the right to health along with the concomitant responsibilities for its realization ascribed to nation-state and non-state actors. It discusses the remit of health security as the provision and protection of health rights through responsibilities at the local, national, and global levels of community and governance. Finally, it argues that health risks and threats cannot be completely eliminated, but rather must be identified and responded to in a coordinated manner involving individuals, communities, national states, international organizations, and the global (conceptual) community.",

At worst, they can cause sepsis: a toxic condition resulting from the spread of bacteria or their toxins, 5 which can lead to death. Bacterial infections seemed to meet their match with the discovery of antibiotics, most especially of penicillin, made from the Penicillium fungus.

            "text": "Each case handled here illustrates an epidemic (potential) which differs in its primary mode of transmission-airborne, sexual transmission, exchange of bodily fluids, and vector-borne-as well as in its potency. This endows the analytical comparison with differentiable points; especially important given that the world will experience another epidemic, the nature of which is unknown. Anticipating necessary coordinated policy responses thus requires a flexibility of approach gleaned only by taking into account plausible outbreaks, their similarities and differences, and their possibility of (re)combination. This is particularly the case with regard to zoonoses. Zoonoses are defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"diseases and infections that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans.\" 8 Two of the youngest, most devastating zoonoses are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Ebola Virus Disease (EDV). Infectious spread of either of these two diseases is still confined to the exchange of contaminated blood or bodily fluid. By contrast, tuberculosis (TB), SARS, H5N1, as well as Mers-CoV, are transmitted through the air. Though they may emerge capable of transmitting infection via one routeblood-the changes wrought by evolution mean that diseases can also mutate to become more infectious: either changing their mode of transmission, for instance from blood-borne to airborne, or becoming resistant to medications to fight them. 9 When emerging or reemerging diseases cause an outbreak, these can take a number of forms. In rare instances, such as the case of polio registered on September 1, 2015 in Ukraine, one infection is enough to constitute an outbreak. 10 More often than not, a seemingly isolated infection leads to additional cases. This was also the case in Ukraine. A disease outbreak which remains within the borders of a national state is termed an \"epidemic,\" whereas a disease that breaches borders is known as a \"pandemic.\" Thus there are both national HIV epidemics, as well as a global HIV pandemic. The distinction is useful not only to delineate geographic locations of infectious diseases and whether these are epidemic or pandemic, but also to differentiate varying characteristics of epidemic outbreaks, such as differing modes of transmission, even within a global pandemic.",

It posits that such ordering takes place on three levels: First, responses primarily by the medical establishment at the individual and community (local). Second, structural interventions: regulations, and institutions. This takes place at the national level, since states are entrusted with the well-being of their populations. As such, structural interventions are applied initially at the intrastate level, within a state's territorial boarders. However, many health threats are not confined within one state, but are apt to spread.

Health relates to food security, to economic welfare and ultimately to peace and security. Critical here is that the mere definition does not create health. A litany of pledges to the right to health have been codified in various international treaties, conventions and declarations, 15 none of which render it reality.

A century ago, communicable diseases, such as smallpox, measles, and waterborne infections, were major contributors to famine death tolls-and there can be no doubt that immunisation campaigns, improved water and sanitation, and better primary health care have made food crises far less lethal than before. 16 The definition of health used in this book is oriented towards that of the WHO.",

It is to be differentiated from rubella, also known as German measles or three-day measles. 29 Another example, pertussis, is also known as whooping cough. All three of these are highly contagious, meaning they are easily transmitted between human hosts. As each is commonly described as a \"childhood\" illness, the label incorrectly gives the linguistic impression of being harmless-easily overcome during childhood by a child.

It is, however, dependent upon the commitment, capacity and/or coordination of each national state. Each state is legally responsible for the security-expanded to arguably include health-of its citizens, but only according to its ability to protect and provide. This can lead to gaping holes in both the conceptualization and the implementation of interventions to support health security. While the movements to demand healthcare, leading to increased access to HIV and AIDS medications, for example, are beyond the scope of this book, it is worth noting that health for all in principle has not translated into health for all either in policy or in practice. Non-citizens, for instance, can easily be excluded from the citizen-rights /state-responsibility relationship, with little recourse to alleviate their situation. The current migration streams are set to exacerbate this challenge. If and when (political) refugees are granted asylum, they are entitled to health benefits, among others. Yet this recognition process is often long and arduous. During periods of economic prosperity, so-called economic migrants might have access to health care systems in recipient countries. This can change abruptly, especially when economies contract. For instance, in the wake of the global financial crisis, the government of Spain passed the Royal Decree Law (RDL) 16/2012 with the stated aim of guaranteeing \"the sustainability of the National Health System.\" 35 The law, together with additional legislation \"re-defines who is entitled to health care and who is not [ . . . ].\" 36 Before the RDP was passed . . . all residents in the Spanish territory were entitled to public health care-universal coverage-irrespective of their status and legal status. [By contrast] The RDP explicitly links entitlement to contribution to the system, and two new categories replace \"residency,\" namely the insured-i.e. those who pay or have paid some social security contribution to the system-and their beneficiaries-i.e. spouse and children under 26. 37, 38 This unrecognition of rights, as it were, makes it all the more critical to consider the third dimension of reordering, that of an-alternativeallocation of responsibility.",

One, long historical memories of notably (white) missionaries using and abusing African blood (samples) 39 and attendant distrust. Numerous MSF staff and clinics were attacked during the pandemic. A related second issue is that MSF, as an NGO, falls outside the lines of governmental-state-citizen-accountability. This can be construed two ways: first, of MSF as an independent actor providing for health security without a political affiliation or agenda; or second, as a seemingly unbiased actor acting with or against the (culpable) incapacity of the state. Any constellation of the above cases puts MSF in a precarious situation akin to that of a stateless non-citizen; with one caveat: MSF could leave. NGOs such as MSF are by definition non-governmental. Notably, external NGOs therefore operate under the agreement and with the permission of national governments, but outside the lines of authority and accountability that hold national governments responsible for their actions on an affected population. That makes NGOs uniquely placed to implement interventions beyond governmental bureaucracies. As long as things runs smoothly, all are satisfied. However, when things go awry, such NGOs may quickly become targets of attack, both internally and externally. Yet unlike national governments, international NGOs have the ability to leave.",

As such, these regulations and institutions operate initially at the intrastate level, within a state's territorial boarders.

These decisions, at the individual, communal, national, international and global levels, are the levers to ordering health. This decision-making is in turn a question of political will, leadership, the general level of knowledge of disease and prevention (options) of the affected population, and the level of risk tolerance. Even where each of these is met with a high degree of acceptance-leadership that acknowledges a health threat and prepares to implement control measures (including deploying and paying for communicators and vaccinators, for example), a population aware of and prepared to adhere to prevention measures (from hand-washing to quarantine), and a risk tolerance that enables, for example, the trade in foodstuffs but limits population movement-it is not always possible to contain the threat. Here it appears unclear where-within the territories of national states, or internationally-lies responsibility for (whose) health. Towards that end, the following questions-and answers to them-pertaining to individual, communal, national and international borders and, critically, the responsibility for securing them, form a background to understanding and responding to health threats that may cross each boundary.",

This is primarily because the number of infectious pathogens are set to increase. Furthermore, it is because-due to long-wave globalization 41 and the inability of states to isolate themselves (except in a few select cases (North Korea))-where epidemics once were more or less tied to localized outbreaks contained within national borders, they are more likely than not to become pandemics-multicountry epidemicswithin hours or days. This has been the case since the 1918 influenza pandemic, and more recently since the HIV and AIDS epidemics (starting ca. 1983) illustrated the reach of a global pandemic, followed by SARS (2003), H5N1 (first reported in 1997, the largest to date in 2004/2005), and Mers-CoV (first reported in 2012, largest to date in 2015). 42 All told, between 1940 and 2004, 300 pathogens have \"either been newly introduced into human populations or have emerged in place where they've never been seen before,\" 43 among them the above list as well as Ebola, and also novel forms of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 44 A shifting cast of characters-actors, agents, alliances-is struggling not only to define risk and response, but to come to terms with the permanence of uncertainty: not all risks are equal, not all responses eradicate them, either. Contemporary global health confronts the challenge of change, of continually changing challenges including, among others, environmental factors, pathogenic evolutions, demographic shifts, ideological factors and economics. Indeed, the rising economic toll of healthcare threatens both individual bankruptcy and saps the economic potential of many a national state. Each of these challenges is influencing the landscape of decision-making in local and global health against the backdrop of what Khama Rogo of the World Bank describes in the context of Ebola as, \"our everyday.\" 45 This everyday is the challenge: to identify and meet health risks and threats in a collective way to coordinate responses that enhance all health and human security.",

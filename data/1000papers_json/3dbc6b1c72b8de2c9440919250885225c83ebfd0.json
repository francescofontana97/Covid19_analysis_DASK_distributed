During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic there was a significant reduction in the number of trauma operations completed, to mean 39/week from 53/week in 2018-2019 (26% reduction; p = 0.001) (figure 2).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "Weekly referrals by year Weekly trauma operations by year", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Surgical treatment during COVID-19 outbreak compared with equivalent period in previous years", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Specific aetiologies of cases referred during pandemic and equivalent period in previous years.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>2017 </td><td>2018 </td><td>2019 </td><td>2020 </td><td>p-value </td></tr><tr><td>Assault </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1.0 </td></tr><tr><td>Domestic abuse </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1.0 </td></tr><tr><td>Safeguarding concern </td><td>0 </td><td>2 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>1.0 </td></tr><tr><td>Self-harm </td><td>1 </td><td>4 </td><td>5 </td><td>2 </td><td>1.0 </td></tr><tr><td>Non-accidental injury </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1.0 </td></tr><tr><td>Polytrauma managed locally </td><td>6 </td><td>6 </td><td>7 </td><td>8 </td><td>1.0 </td></tr><tr><td>Polytrauma repatriated </td><td>4 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>5 </td><td> 0.37 </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Distribution of all injuries referred during COVID-19 pandemic and equivalent weeks in previous years.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>2017 </td><td>2018 </td><td>2019 </td><td>2020 </td><td>p-value </td></tr><tr><td>Fractures </td><td>Simple fracture 418 </td><td>375 </td><td>390 </td><td>259 </td><td>&lt;0.001 </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Fragility hip fracture 100 </td><td>100 </td><td>119 </td><td>91 </td><td>0.31 </td></tr><tr><td>Periprosthetic fracture </td><td>Open fracture 22 </td><td>27 </td><td>12 </td><td>18 </td><td>0.96 </td></tr><tr><td>6 </td><td>3 </td><td>10 </td><td>10 </td><td>0.31 </td></tr><tr><td>Fracture - dislocation </td><td>Pathological fracture 1 </td><td>2 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1.0 </td></tr><tr><td>13 </td><td>15 </td><td>16 </td><td>6 </td><td>0.07 </td></tr><tr><td>Dislocations Dislocation native joint </td><td>9 </td><td>11 </td><td>14 </td><td>2 </td><td>0.008 </td></tr><tr><td>Dislocation prosthetic joint </td><td>13 </td><td>10 </td><td>7 </td><td>9 </td><td>1.0 </td></tr><tr><td>Infection </td><td>Bone/joint infection 8 </td><td>9 </td><td>11 </td><td>12 </td><td>0.51 </td></tr><tr><td>Neoplastic Primary bone tumour </td><td>Soft Tissue infection 61 </td><td>53 </td><td>58 </td><td>29 </td><td>&lt;0.001 </td></tr><tr><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>1.0 </td></tr><tr><td>Metastatic bone disease </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>5 </td><td>4 </td><td>0.51 </td></tr><tr><td>Complications Fracture non / malunion </td><td>3 </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1.0 </td></tr><tr><td>Post-operative problem </td><td>9 </td><td>10 </td><td>13 </td><td>6 </td><td>0.40 </td></tr><tr><td>Other trauma </td><td>Foreign body 5 </td><td>10 </td><td>17 </td><td>4 </td><td>0.12 </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Haematoma 9 </td><td>7 </td><td>4 </td><td>13 </td><td>0.09 </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Ligament injury 13 </td><td>6 </td><td>7 </td><td>5 </td><td>0.51 </td></tr><tr><td>Nerve injury (including nerve </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>0.31 </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>root impingement) 10 </td><td>5 </td><td>32 </td><td>22 </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Soft Tissue 41 </td><td>52 </td><td>48 </td><td>31 </td><td>0.07 </td></tr><tr><td>Traumatic Amputation </td><td>Tendon injury 7 </td><td>16 </td><td>12 </td><td>12 </td><td>1.0 </td></tr><tr><td>3 </td><td>0 </td><td>2 </td><td>2 </td><td>0.94 </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Wound 28 </td><td>30 </td><td>25 </td><td>11 </td><td>0.004 </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Table 3: All surgical treatments during COVID-19 outbreak compared with equivalent period in previous years", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>2017 </td><td>2018 </td><td>2019 </td><td>2020 </td><td>p-value </td></tr><tr><td>Fracture surgery </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Open reduction &amp;

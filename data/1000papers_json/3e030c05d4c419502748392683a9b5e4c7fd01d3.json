In the pre-COVID-19 era, strains such as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 have been associated with upper respiratory diseases in immunocompetent hosts, infants, young children and elderly individuals. 2 The first multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel for a large number of respiratory pathogens was approved by Food and Drug Administration in 2008. The incidence of coronavirus in respiratory specimens using such tests has been reported as ~8% 3 . To the best of our knowledge, literature describing the characteristics and impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD) on hospitalizations with a diagnosis of coronavirus from pre-COVID-19 era in United States is unknown 4-7 . Hence we analyzed a large administrative national database, National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) dataset of patients hospitalized between 2016 and 2017, to identify hospitalizations with a diagnosis of corona virus and described the patient demographics, hospitalization characteristics, clinical comorbidities, outcomes and healthcare resource utilization based upon presence and absence of CVD. records utilized were derived from the NIS, largest publicly available all-payer inpatient care database in the United States. NIS is the subset of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The details regarding the NIS data have been previously published and used. 8-10 As coronavirus related International Classification of Disease diagnostic codes were introduced as part of 10 th revision, our study sample spans from 2016 through 2017 (2017 is the latest available dataset in NIS).

Among these, 21,300 (n=8, 250 in 2016 and n=13, 050 in 2017) had a diagnosis of coronavirus, which formed our final analytical cohort.

Our study demonstrates that CVD (present in ~56% hospitalizations) is associated with worse outcomes and higher healthcare resource utilization in hospitalizations with a diagnosis of coronavirus in a non-pandemic setting. To account for possible confounding from multiple factors that could influence mortality, we rigorously adjusted our findings for age and other demographic factors as well as comorbidities. The persistence of significantly increased risks of poorer outcomes associated with the presence of CVD, despite such adjustments, strengthens the overall validity of our findings. Although the findings are not unexpected, our report helps to raise awareness about high-risk group of coronavirus hospitalizations with CVD. This emphasizes the need for further research, clinical care tracks and other strategies to mitigate the adverse outcomes and improve healthcare efficiency.Previous studies focusing on coronavirus from single center non-US cohorts have reported CVD in 30-40% of cases 15-17 with CVD complications ranging between 7 to 30% 14, 15, 18-21 . A systematic analysis of 637 MERS-CoV cases from Asia and Europe showed that diabetes and hypertension was prevalent in about 50% of the patients and CVD was present in 30% 17 . Recently, among 99 cases with COVID-19 in China, 40% patients had CVD 22 . A recent meta-analysis of six studies reported that ~8% of patients with COVID-19 had evidence of acute cardiac injury 15 . Wang et al. in their single center study of 138 hospitalizations found acute cardiac injury, shock, and arrhythmia to be present in 7.2%, 8.7%, and 16.7% of patients respectively while another study described cardiac injury in 19.7% of their patients 14, 19 . A case series of 15 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome reported presence of myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia in 10 patients 21 . Preliminary reports in COVID-19 patients suggest there may be higherJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f rates of myocarditis and arrhythmia that necessitates further study 20, 23, 24 . These dissimilarities from the present study can be attributed to differences in the different strains of coronavirus, study sample size, pandemic vs. non-pandemic timeline, patient characteristics, regional differences and definitions (biomarker/chart review vs. ICD-10 code based). CVD patients represent a high-risk population for pandemic transmission and worse outcomes in viral infections as shown previously 15, 17, 19, 20, 25-28 . In a systematic review of 234 articles, among 610,782 participants, CVD subgroup was three times more likely to develop pandemic infections 25 . The association of mortality with CV injury defined by troponin elevation was recently reported by Shi et al. in a cohort of 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 . Similar to our study, patients with CVD were older, had a higher burden of comorbidities and more likely to have critical conditions such as acute respiratory failure. Older adults have different innate response to viral infections than younger adults in terms of cascade of events leading to increased type 2 cytokine production and decreased expression of type 1 interferon beta that eventually leads to cytokine storm 29 . Viral infections with coronavirus has been shown to have higher plasma levels of C-reactive protein, cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 14, 22 , The increased cytokine synthesis from metabolic diseases along with cytokine overload from Th1 to Th2 shift can lead to endothelial damage 30 . Hence as a result of increased metabolic demand in the setting of viral sepsis syndrome, it is possible that the underlying stable CV disease decompensates leading to worse outcomes 20, 31 . Previous studies have also shown that coronavirus strains of SARS may down-regulate the myocardial Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 system, which J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f leads to myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes 32 . The inflammatory cascade up-regulation might contribute to rupture of coronary atherosclerotic plaques along with endothelial dysfunction predisposing patients to thromboembolic events.",

More than half of the infected were asymptomatic, the remaining had only mild symptoms, no one required hospitalization. Symptom severity was associated to lower cT values. Social contacts and family were the most common sources of infection, no infection could be traced to training or matches. Conclusion: Sports played outdoors involving close contact between athletes represent a limited risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe illness when preventive measures are in place.",

The main difference between these spreader events and our setting is that they occurred indoors in relatively restricted spaces, whereas our athletes played and trained outdoors. Interestingly, two of the three reports (dance and squash) represent non-contact sports. This supports the hypothesis that respiratory droplets (present in all settings) represent the main transmission mode also during sporting events, but that an outdoor setting with good air circulation attenuates risk.

The country-wide rate of infection in Qatar during the study period was 191 per 100 000 per week (figure 1), with 11.2% positive or reactive among thosesampled. The corresponding figure for players was 457 infections per 100 000 per week (4.4% positive).Since mainly symptomatic individuals were tested in the general population and players were tested regardless of symptoms, it appears that the rate of infections among players was as expected based on the background viral transmission rate during the study period. Fewer than half of the players with positive or reactive tests reported any symptoms. The German professional football league (Bundesliga) also resumed play at the same time, but with a population infection rate of only 5 per 100 000 per week.(10) It is therefore not surprising that in our collective, 85 of 1337 tested during the entire study period were positive or reactive, whereas in the German study, only 14 of 2506 participants (players and officials) returned positive PCR tests (of which 4 turned out to be remnants of old infections). Still, what is clear, is that there were no mass outbreaks within teams and no matches needed to be cancelled in Qatar in spite of a population infection rate nearly 40 times greater than in Germany.",

This is in line with the reports of severity in the population of similar age worldwide and in Qatar (21), highlighting the high proportion of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases in young individuals without comorbidities. Interestingly, even if symptoms were mild in all cases, lower cT values were associated with greater symptom scores (although there were a few exceptions, Figure 3), likely because the cT measured only represents one point in time, while the symptom score retrospectively records the entire course of the infection. Our observation supports previous reports: viral load may be an important determinant for the severity of symptoms of a SARS-CoV-2 infection (12). From a clinical perspective, it suggests to specifically monitor subjects that return low cT values in routine screening tests, as they are more likely to develop more pronounced symptoms. It also highlights the fact that screening interventions based on clinical symptoms only, such as temperature monitoring, might miss a significant number of infections.",

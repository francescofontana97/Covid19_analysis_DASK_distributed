One important aspect of CUREs is students' engagement in collaboration. The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic created an immediate need for meaningful, collaborative experiences in CUREs. We developed a partnership with the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) database, WormBase, in which students submitted annotations of published manuscripts to the website. Due to the stress on students during this time of crisis, qualitative data were collected in lieu of quantitative pre-and postanalyses. Most students reported on cognitive processes that represent mid-level Bloom's categories. By partnering with WormBase, students gained insight into the scientific community and contributed as community members. We describe possible modifications for future courses, potential expansion of the WormBase collaboration, and future directions for quantitative analysis.",

This activity is scalable, especially if students are working on the same paper or in groups. By using a single paper, many different annotations could be produced without requiring instructors to read many different papers. If students work in groups, group members could each individually produce a practice annotation for the same data, which could be peer-reviewed and refined into a single annotation for each group. This would reduce the burden on WormBase staff by minimizing redundant submissions.

Student reactions to the WormBase annotation exercise. We classified the responses of students for the first four questions (Appendix 6) using five categories (very negative, slightly negative, neutral, slightly positive, and very positive) that described their experiences with the Worm-Base annotation activity. The majority of students rated the activity positively when they compared it with previous biology classes (Fig. 3A) . Students who did not have a positive experience often reported feeling either unsupported in their learning, which may have been due in part to the online format, or as though the activity was unnecessary. Nonetheless, negative responses sometimes included evidence of student learning. For example, one student wrote:",

For responses that used more than one category, the higher one was adopted for the purposes of quantification. Answers that did not address students' thinking were categorized as n/a (no answer, or one-word answers, such as \"no\") or no change, which indicates that a student only responded that they already knew the content.

It could also enhance the metacognitive aspects of the process for students, who could directly address what they do and do not understand with their collaborators.

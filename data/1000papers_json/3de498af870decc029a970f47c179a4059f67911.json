The severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been associated with significantly deranged coagulation parameters and increased incidence of thrombotic events. Deranged coagulation parameters, such as D-dimers and fibrin degradation products, can indicate a poor prognosis, and their measurement will help stratify the patients according to the disease severity, need of intensive care unit admission, and prediction of the clinical course. Gaps in understanding the natural history of the disease cause difficulties in tailoring therapies and optimizing the management of patients. Lack of specific treatment further complicates this situation. While thrombotic events can cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients, a focused approach to the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) can, to a great extent, decrease the disease burden caused by thrombotic diseases. Pharmacological prophylactic anticoagulants and mechanical therapies such as pneumatic compression devices can help prevent venous thromboembolism and other thrombotic events. Thrombotic events due to COVID-19, their prevention and management, are the focus of this paper, with the prospect of providing insights into this relatively unexplored area.",

All but one patient in this study, who developed a thrombotic event, were getting a standard dose of prophylactic anticoagulation. The same study also recorded a major-bleeding event rate of 5.6% in critically ill patients [14] . In another retrospective cohort study on COVID-19 patients admitted to an ICU, the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was 25% [15] . Moreover, patients who developed VTE were older, had lymphocytopenia, increased D-dimer, and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). This study also linked Tcell immune dysfunction to the increased incidence of VTE [15] .",

These parameters, if checked on admission to the hospital, can serve as a guide to triage patients, based on severity and risk of deterioration. Their serial monitoring may also help predict the clinical course of the disease and tailor the required therapy. In a retrospective cohort study, looking at the causes of elevated D-dimers, investigators found that infec-tions were the most common cause of elevated D-dimers. Of the patients with infections having elevated D-dimers, pneumonia was the cause in almost 2/3rd of cases [20] . This highlights the propensity of lung infections as the cause of elevated D-dimers in general. However, this also raises an important question -is the COVID-19 related rise in D-dimers significantly more than that associated with other lung infections? This could only be answered by conducting a study comparing D-dimer levels in COVID-19 related and non-COVID-19 related lung infections, which to date has not been reported.",

It can be in the form of a heparin drip (per parenteral protocol) or enoxaparin (1mg/kg twice a day) based on whether the patient is in the intensive care unit or not. 3 -Patients at low risk of thromboembolism are further classified based on the D-dimer levels. A) D-dimer <0.5 \u03bcg/mL = Prophylactic dose anticoagulation (Enoxaparin 40mg/day) B) D-dimer 0.5 to 3.0 \u03bcg/mL = Enoxaparin 40mg twice a day C) D-dimer >3.0 \u03bcg/mL = Enoxaparin 1mg/kg twice a day 4 -The patients at high risk of thromboembolism and having markedly elevated D-dimer (>3.0 \u03bcg/mL) should undergo a point-of-care ultrasound. Based on its results, a call should be on whether to continue therapeutic dose or switch to prophylactic dose anticoagulation.International society of thrombosis and haemostasis (ISTH) on the management of coagulopathy[26]",

The most effective means against viral diseases like COVID-19, and also one of the most impactful human inventions, i.e. vaccines, will take months if not years to develop and to prove safe and efficacious in clinical trials. Among the few options readily available for health care providers to treat this highly contagious and deadly disease is to repurpose an existing drug, especially if the drug has been exposed to a diverse patient population with known and acceptable safety outcomes. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate 1 (1, HCQ, Figure 1 ) is the front runner fitting such a profile, as indicated by several very preliminary clinical trials, especially when combined with azithromycin. 2 While the efficacy of HCQ against COVID-19 still needs to be proved in larger randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT) , several of which are underway, 3 demand for HCQ has already skyrocketed in recent weeks due in part to the surprising virulence of the disease, yearning for cure from the populace, and some highly visible endorsements. This has propelled several states and pharmacy chains in the United States to implement allocation program, a measure to curb hoarding of the product J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f so as to ensure a steady albeit limited supply chain. 4 Physicians are also urged not to prescribe the medicine for prophylactic use, since many patients rely on this drug for treating their debilitating chronic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Meanwhile, several manufactures have responded by either pledging to donate a substantial number of tablets or promising to ramp up production. 5", "cite_spans": [{"start": 995, "end": 996, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1419, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 681, "end": 689, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "On 28 March 2020, the US FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to permit the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ, 1), and its older chemical cousin chloroquine (di)phosphate (CQ, 2), to be supplied from the Strategic National Stockpile to treat adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg or more and are hospitalized with COVID-19 for whom a clinical trial is not available, or participation is not feasible. 6 Clinically justified or not, the current shortage for HCQ is acute.

Of note, the current worldwide need of 300 metric ton for HCQ was spread out across an entire year and was met steadily, mostly for chronic diseases. The COVID-19 demand, however, is an immediate surge. For example, if 2% of the US population needs treatment, 40 metric tons of HCQ would be need urgently. If, however, 20% of the US population needs to be treated, 400 metric tons of HCQ would be needed in weeks.

Larger demand, however, would seriously challenge the global manufacturing capacity and capability to ramp up production. It is a significant challenge, but not insurmountable, for the following reasons:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Can the demand be met, why? and how?"}, {"text": "\uf0b7 HCQs formulation is relatively straight forward and the drug product can be manufactured in a general-purpose fill-finish plant, if supply of API can be met. There are ample capacities for drug product manufacturing in the US and the rest of the world to repurpose or ramp up HCQ tablets production. \uf0b7 The manufacturing process for HCQ API, or hydroxychloroquine sulfate, is considered to be average in overall complexity, when compared with other marketed small molecule therapeutic drugs. In fact, the original procedure for making HCQ as disclosed by its inventor Surrey in 1950 7 is still practiced by a majority of API suppliers, variants of improvement notwithstanding. The compound can be made in 4-8 steps from abundant petroleum feed stocks such benzene, ethylene, propylene and other commodity chemicals. Historic price for HCQ API had been below $150/kg. \uf0b7 Production cycle time from start to finish can range from 3 months to one year. New facilities generally take 1-2 year to build and qualify. \uf0b7 There is a high degree of homology on the manufacturing processes as well as chemical composition of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (Figure 1 ). Supply chains and manufacturing site can be interconverted to suit the changing demand. \uf0b7 Analytical control for both the end product and production process is very straightforward, especially when compared with biologics. \uf0b7 Quality of pharmaceutical can't be ensured by end product quality control alone, but has to be achieved under an elaborate GMP system for the whole production process including procurement of raw material, process validation, final packaging and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f shipment. Recent debacles with COVID-19 related personal protection equipment like face mask and ventilator supply chain is testimonial to the importance of balancing the quality rigor and supply speedy in an emergency situation. The US FDA, for example, had issued an import alert against Ipca laboratories due to quality problems found in its plants in 2017. However on March 21 , 2020, at the wake of surge in demand for HCQ and CQ, the agency moved to make an \"exception to the import alert\" for three of Ipca's facilities, allowing the firm to supply tablets as well as raw materials for making chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulphate to the US markets. 9 \uf0b7 China is a major provider of raw martials for making HCQ APIs both inside China and other countries. Spread of COVID-19 is largely contained in the country now and most plants are resuming normal production capacities. Surplus API capacities in China is substantial and has yet to be tapped fully for the emerging global demand. 10 \uf0b7 India's capacity to the global drug supply is very important. The current trend of COVID-19 spreading in the country is troubling. Impact to the current and future supply of HCQ and many other essential drugs are uncertain. The country has recently banned export of HCQ and chloroquine 10 and hopefully the decision can be reversed once domestic supply is secured. Of grave concern is also the preparedness of its IT service industry which plays a vital role to support many multinational companies. \uf0b7 The COVID-19 virus strikes and cares no national border. Country governments should also work together to lower bureaucratic barriers for drug supply while ensuring quality in innovative and efficient ways. The regulatory bodies can and have to work together to find creative solutions.

Lessons can be learned from the success of penicillin production scaled up from milligrams to metric tons within two years during the World War II.

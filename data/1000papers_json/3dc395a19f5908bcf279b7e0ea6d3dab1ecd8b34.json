With seed-borne, mechanical transmission and resistant breaking traits, tobamoviruses pose serious threat to vegetable production worldwide. With the absence of a commercial resistant cultivar, growers are encouraged to take preventative measures to manage those highly contagious viral diseases. However, there is no information available on which disinfectants are effective to deactivate the virus infectivity on contaminated hands, tools and equipment for these emerging tobamoviruses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a collection of 16 chemical disinfectants for their effectiveness against mechanical transmission of two emerging tobamoviruses, ToBRFV and CGMMV.",

Percent infection of plants was measured through symptom observation on the test plants and the presence of the virus was confirmed through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with appropriate antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA based on data collected from three independent experiments.",

Based on their genome organization and host infection, viruses in the genus Tobamovirus are divided into three subgroups infecting Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, and Brassicaceae and Asteraceae species [3] ). TMV has been widely used as a model to study host pathogen interaction and virus evolution since its discovery 100 years ago by Bejernick [4] . A new tobamovirus infecting tomatoes and peppers is Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), which was recently discovered in 2014-2015 in Jordan [5] and Israel [6] . ToBRFV is considered more virulent than other known tomato-infecting tobamoviruses, as it breaks the popular Tm-2 2 resistance gene which is present in many commercial tomato cultivars [6, 7] . ToBRFV outbreaks in greenhouse tomatoes have been reported in countries around the world, including China [8] and Palestine [9] in Asia, Egypt in Africa [10] , Germany [11] , Greece [12] , Italy [13] ), Turkey [14] and the United Kingdom [15] in Europe, and Mexico [16, 17] , the United States [18, 19] and Canada [20] in North America. In response to the global outbreaks of ToBRFV, the United States Department of Agriculture issued a Federal Order in November 2019 [21] and the Europe Union has declared a quarantine status for ToBRFV [22] .",

Therefore, it is important to plant certified virus-free seeds that have been tested for tobamoviruses. Although there is no known insect vector proven to transmit tobamoviruses, insect pollinators, including bumble bees and honeybees, have been shown to spread tobamoviruses. This virus spread is likely through mechanical wounding due to buzzing pollination [47] [48] [49] . Once introduced to a production field or a greenhouse, tobamovirus can remain infectious for a couple of years on contaminated surfaces such as agricultural tools and machinery, irrigation water and contaminated plant debris. Healthy plants can easily become infected through contact by contaminated hands, cutting tools, dirty clothing in plant handling practices.",

Two user-friendly biologicals (SP2700 and Lactoferrin) and some other chemical disinfectants would need further systemic analysis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 16 disinfectants for their effectiveness against mechanical transmission of two emerging tobamoviruses, ToBRFV and CGMMV. Disinfectants that generated promising results with 90-100% efficacy against either of two tobamoviruses, include 0.5% Lactoferrin, 2% Virocid, 10% Clorox, and Virkon (2% against CGMMV and 3% against ToBRFV). SP2700 generated an effective response against the spread of CGMMV, but a poor response against ToBRFV. We were particularly interested in selecting disinfectants with broad spectrum effects between the two tobamoviruses with a goal of rendering their recommendation to disinfect other tobamoviruses, or even other viruses.",

Bioassays were conducted on tomato 'Moneymaker' plants through rub-inoculation, same as in our previous study [53] . Test plants were observed weekly and scored for visual symptoms ( Fig. 1 , Additional file 2: Table 2 ) at 3-4 weeks post inoculation, with a confirmation ELISA test on asymptomatic plants. Based on our preliminary data collection (Additional file 2: Table 2 ), we observed no major deviation in percent infection on test plants from each of three short exposure times (10 s, 30 s or 60 s). Therefore, analysis of percent infection for each treatment was based on a combined data of nine plants from three points. Interestingly, arranging those tested chemicals based on their increasing efficacy (with decreasing infection rate) against ToBRFV revealed a broad range of effects on tomato plants (Fig. 2) . The effectiveness of four treatments from three disinfectants (0.5% and 2% Virocid, 0.5% Lactoferrin and 10% Clorox) were most significant, generating 0% infectivity on test plants. Five other treatments displayed some effect but not enough, generating only 10-45% infection rates on the test plants. These treatments were 2% Virex (11.1% infectivity), 2% Virkon (22% infectivity), 50% Lysol (26% infectivity), 2.4% SP 2700 (30% infectivity), and 10% trisodium phosphate (TSP, 44.4% infectivity). Overall, ten treatments were considered no effect, as they generated 50-100 percent infection rates on the tested plants. These treatments included 0.1% Lactoferrin, Ethanol/Urea/Citric Acid (EUC), 2% Kleen grow, 1.2% SP2700, 2% Simple green, 50% Purrell, 50% Protecteav, 10% Non-fat dried (NFD) Milk, 400 ppm Microside and 50% Microsan (Fig. 2) . However, it is important to note that 2% Virex, 2.4% SP2700, and 2% Virocid showed some level of phytoxicity to the test plants upon treatment (Additional file 3: Fig. 1 ).",

The seedlings (in 1-2 leaf stage) were rub-inoculated with a freshly prepared inoculum of CGMMV that had been exposed to the appropriate concentration of a disinfectant at each set of exposure times (10 s, 30 s or 60 s). The test plants were observed weekly and scored for visual symptoms at 3-4 weeks post inoculation (Additional file 2: Table 2 ). Presence of the target virus was verified through ELISA test against CGMMV. Efficacy was analyzed based on three independent experiments, and three biological replicates for each treatment per exposure time. Similarly, as observed in ToBRFV, there were no major deviation in the percent infection rate on test plants from each of the three short exposure times (10, 30 and 60 s). Therefore, analysis of percent infection for each treatment was based on a combined data of nine plants from three plants in each of three time points. Efficacy of a disinfectant was determined by percent infectivity remaining on the treated sample, where a higher percent infectivity corresponded to a lower efficacy of the disinfectant and vice versa. Those disinfectants resulting in 0 to 7.5% infection rate were selected for further analysis (Fig. 3) . Overall, six chemicals and eight treatments including 10% TSP, 0.5% and 2% Virocid, 10% Clorox, 1.2% and 2.4% SP2700, 2% Virkon, and 0.5% Lactoferrin, showed significantly better efficacy in deactivating virus infectivity against CGMMV within 60 s. Specifically, 10% Clorox, 2.4% SP2700, 0.5% Lactoferrin and 2% Virocid showed complete effect, with 0% infectivity against CGMMV based on three biologically replicated experiments, followed by 1.2% SP2700 (3.7% infectivity), 0.5% Virocid (3.7% infectivity), 10% TSP (7.4% infectivity), 2% Virkon Fig. 2 Effectiveness of disinfectants against the mechanical transmission of ToBRFV on tomato.

Keeping in mind the phytotoxic nature of SP 2700 at 1.2% and 2.4% levels, a lower concentration of 0.6% SP 2700 was included against ToBRFV. Three concentrations of SP2700 (0.6%, 1.2% and 2.4%) were tested.

Lactoferrin is a milk-based iron-binding glycoprotein well known for its antimicrobial properties in humans [58] . The antiviral nature of Lactoferrin begins with its binding to a cell receptor, which then mediate blocking the entry of a DNA and RNA based virus into a cell [59] . Previous studies [60, 61] demonstrated that spraying plants with 0.1% Lactoferrin protected them against potato virus X in potatoes and tomato yellow leaf curl virus in tomatoes [60, 61] . Another report [62] showed that 0.1% Lactoferrin inactivated 81% of TMV infection in tobacco when a TMV inoculum was mixed and incubated with lactoferrin for 30 min. In the present study, we were interested in a short-time exposure in order to determine if Lactoferrin could be used as a disinfectant against the spread of ToBRFV and CGMMV. Surprisingly, the 0.5% Lactoferrin treatments were shown to achieve a complete protection on test plants against both tobamoviruses, ToBRFV and CGMMV. The treatments by 0.1% Lactoferrin were also effective, although not in complete protection. As a natural product, Lactoferrin could be handled with bare hands as well as for disinfecting cutting tools and equipment.",

SP2700 was shown to directly deactivate the TMV particles when incubated with 0.5 mM (6.8 G/L) for 30 min. TMV particles were also inactivated when incubated with 500 mg/ml (0.5 G/L) for 30 min [65, 66] . In the present study, we were again interested in determining its quick action as a disinfectant against ToBRFV and CGMMV. Thus, we used higher rates in our virus deactivation studies. In CGMMV treatments, 0.6% (6 G/L), 1.2% (12 G/L) and 2.4% (24 G/L) reduced the percent infectivity of CGMMV to 17%, 3.7% and 0%, respectively. On the other hand, in ToBRFV treatments, only higher concentration (2.4%) of SP 2700 reduced the virus infectivity to 30% against ToBRFV, with no major effect on virus infectivity with two lower concentrations (1.2% and 0.6%). At this moment, it is still unknown as to why there was such a dramatic discrepancy existed between these two tobamoviruses. The reason for their differential infectivity could be because viruses may react differently to this antimicrobial chemical and in two different host plants. The shorter incubation time used in our study also calls for the use of a higher concentration of SP2700 for virus inactivation.",

QABC are nitrogenous based organic compounds, where the ammonium is a nitrogen atom with four hydrogen atoms attached around it. Quaternary ammonium is created when each of those four hydrogen atoms are replaced with some combination of four other organic chains or rings.

A disinfectant with 60% or more of alcohol can effectively deactivate coronaviruses (such as SARS-CoV-2), which have a lipid membrane.

These disinfectants include Clorox (10%), Lactoferrin (0.5%), Virkon (2% against CGMMV and 3% against ToBRFV), Virocid (2% and 0.5%) and Virex (3% against ToBRFV).

These results were consistent with previous studies using other plant virus pathosystems [53, 54, 69] , suggesting that some or all of these selected disinfectants may have a broader effect against other viruses.

The objective of this formative evaluation was to assess Mayo Clinic Department of Health Sciences Research (HSR) faculty and staff perceptions toward a proposed departmental DEI plan and to explore findings by diversity and professional subgroups. Materials and methods: Key plan components include recruitment and support for diverse individuals; training for all HSR employees and leaders; and a review system to capture diversity and inclusion feedback for leaders. Additional activities include building inclusion \"nudges\" into existing performance reviews. To assess pre-implementation beliefs about specific plan components, we polled attendees at a departmental staff meeting in July 2020. Results: Overall, respondents (n = 162) commonly endorsed a blinded promotion review process and DEI training for all staff and leaders as most important. In contrast, respondents expressed less support for plan activities related to \"nudges.\" However, attitudes among certain diversity or professional groups toward specific plan activities diverged from their non-diversity group counterparts. Qualitative feedback indicated awareness of the need to address DEI issues. Discussion: Overall, HSR faculty and staff respondents conveyed support for the plan. However, some specific plan activities were perceived differently by members of certain diversity or professional subgroups. Conclusion: These findings present a DEI framework on which other institutions can build and point to future directions for how DEI activities may be differentially perceived by impacted faculty and staff.",

            "text": "Racism, sexism, and other forms of systemic bias and discrimination are pervasive in the US society, and this is reflected in academic medical institutions. Decades of research has established that systems of bias are inextricably linked to human health as well as health care access and utilization [1, 2] , underscoring the importance of a diverse workforce and inclusive organizational cultures among institutions associated with health care delivery and research. However, although the health services research workforce in the USA represents a multidisciplinary community of scholars with an expressed commitment to furthering equity in health care [3] , many identities remain underrepresented in the ranks of academic medical centers and research institutions [4, 5] . For example, less than 5% of all US medical school faculty are Black or Latinx, and only 35.3% are women [6] . Beyond representation, serious disparities in funding, career satisfaction, formal compensation, and other opportunities persist [7, 8] . Black investigators are 10% points less likely than White applicants to be awarded NIH research funding, even after controlling for educational background, research productivity, and employer characteristics [9] . Female scientists, who comprise over half of health services researchers [10] , are paid considerably less than their male counterparts, on par with national estimates of gender disparity in pay levels [11] . For members of these and other historically marginalized identity groups, such as LGBTQ\u00fe or nonbinary individuals, foreign nationals, and persons with physical disabilities or mental health conditions, the need for change is clear [12] .",

An organization's diversity and inclusion climate may be influenced by several factors, including the role modeling of its leaders, its mission statements and goals, the programs and issues that the organization invests in and prioritizes, the formal and informal rules and policies that may unintentionally disadvantage certain groups, and the individual biases and attitudes of members of the organization. Such individual biases and attitudes are likely influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by power differentials inherent either in society or within the organization's culture, such as male vs. female or senior vs. junior faculty. All of these factors contribute to the psychological safety of individuals within the organization, that is, the degree to which individuals feel that they can be themselves and be welcomed and valued, without fear of discrimination. In turn, people who feel that their identities are safe and valued are more productive and happier in their jobs [14] .",

At Mayo Clinic, a large academic medical center with faculty and staff employed in its Department of Health Sciences Research (HSR) across sites in Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona, a task force was formed in 2018 to develop a department-wide plan for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Consistent with the Association for Clinical and Translation Science (ACTS) strategic objective to develop a diverse and inclusive pipeline of future health services and translational science leaders [15] , the Mayo Clinic HSR DEI plan is centered on increasing overall and subgroups' sense of belonging and overall diversity within the institution. Of note, the HSR plan sits within the context of a larger Mayo Clinic institutional plan that leverages departmental leaders to make changes tailored to the needs of faculty and staff in individual divisions. The purpose of this paper is to detail the components of the Department of HSR DEI plan and report on pre-implementation HSR staff attitudes toward specific activities proposed within the plan.",

In 2018, a seven-member diversity and inclusion task force was convened by the HSR department chair to develop a proposal for a formal departmental DEI program. Through a year-long process, the task force utilized anonymous free text comments from members of the Department of HSR on DEI issues they had faced. Based upon these comments and the research literature, the task force developed an initial multi-pronged approach that formed the basis of the plan presented here. The first step was to add a new leadership dyad [16] (i.e., faculty and staff leaders, respectively) within the department to fully develop and implement the plan. In 2019, the HSR department chair led a search committee for the new Associate Chair for DEI (faculty leader) and the new Allied Health Leader for DEI (staff leader). Following establishment of these individuals (Enders and Pacheco-Spann, respectively) in 2020, they were provided with salary and administrative assistant support and included in the department's executive committee.",

Mayo Clinic HSR DEI plan authors approached its development from a broader faculty \"life course\" perspective, attempting to identify critical junctures at which faculty and staff from a variety of diverse backgrounds are often hindered through biases in promotion and review processes, lack of appropriate mentorship, and majority cultures that may seem hostile to diverse individuals.

Nudging has been widely applied in many different contexts, including diversity and inclusion, where it may serve to raise awareness of unconscious biases or even change organizational processes [27] .

Overall, HSR faculty and staff conveyed support for the plan; notably, over one-quarter of respondents did not reject any components of the plan. In terms of specific plan activities, the activity most commonly endorsed as important and/or potentially impactful was blinded promotion review processes and activities related to DEI training. In contrast, when asked about less direct approachessuch as subtle \"nudges\" or reminders built into review and promotion processes about biases in performance feedback that are commonly manifested toward members of diversity groupsrespondents expressed less support. Interestingly, attitudes toward some specific plan activities expressed by staff members from certain diversity or professional subgroups diverged from their majority counterparts. It is particularly noteworthy that greater proportions of faculty and staff from racial and ethnic minority groups positively endorsed inclusion nudges and blinded promotion reviews compared to White, non-Latinx staff members, while leaders were also more likely than non-leaders to advocate for annual review nudges. These findings have several implications for both DEI plan implementation and future work in this area. First, while research suggests that mandatory anti-bias training shows relatively little efficacy in improving diversity and inclusion within organizations [25] , training for all HSR faculty and staff, and specifically for leaders, was the most widely endorsed plan activity among respondents in our sample. In addition, while behavioral nudges have demonstrated the greatest impact on mitigating the role of biases in organizational settings, these activities were associated with the least amount of support among our respondents, with the exception of racial and ethnic minority participants. We suggest that, in the context of growing awareness of DEI issues, many department members (especially those who are not from backgrounds historically marginalized in academia or medicine) may default to training as the most rational frontline approach to effecting change. Employees may also wish to give themselves and their colleagues the benefit of the doubt by suggesting that any incidence of bias or discrimination is unintentional and stems from a lack of awareness that can be corrected with training.",

More concrete approaches, such as behavioral nudges, are needed to overturn and correct ingrained and implicit biases in the system, a fact perhaps recognized more easily by racial and ethnic minority respondents in our sample, who have long been professionally disadvantaged by the impact of these biases. In addition, the concept of \"nudges\" may be unfamiliar to many audiences, even within an academic setting. Others looking to present on or assess responses to DEI initiatives within their institution should offer specific, concrete examples of \"inclusion nudges\" to ensure that respondents fully understand the concept. Finally, with regard to the annual review inclusion nudges proposed as an activity in our DEI plan, employees may have felt that an annual \"nudge\" is insufficient to make substantial or sustained changes to the department's inclusion climate. In fact, inclusion nudges are currently planned as a quarterly activity at the Mayo Clinic institutional level, an increase in frequency which may impact how employees respond to this idea.",

For instance, others seeking to initiate DEI activities in their institution or department can use this framework as a springboard to assess interest in and attitudes toward specific DEI activities among staff members. It may be particularly useful to contrast differential interest in specific plan components between diverse and nondiverse employees. In addition, based on our experience, we recommend that DEI leaders focus on Table 3 . Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) plan activities endorsed as a) most important and b) most impactful to departmental culture by professional subgroup Notes: Values and percentages refer to respondents within each group endorsing a given activity. Denominators for subgroup percentages vary slightly from the total N for a given subgroup due to differences in item response rates for professional group membership.

In our case, assessment of \"belonging\" and recruitment of diverse individuals were two non-negotiable plan activities. Our early plan assessment efforts may have yielded more meaningful responses by asking meeting attendees to reflect on the activities about which DEI planners were more ambivalent. Finally, although this exploratory work indicated a high level of DEI plan buy-in from staff members, plan administrators at our institution and others can reasonably expect opposition from those who feel such efforts are unnecessary or even harmful. For example, a small number of respondents in our sample expressed concerns about DEI initiatives \"lowering standards\" for professionalism or even forcing conformity in attitudes. Although strategies for responding to DEI opposition are not explicitly addressed in our plan, this is an important concern that should be integrated into future DEI initiatives. For example, DEI leaders can proactively defend against similar concerns by explicitly stating that any change to professional or academic standards is not a goal of DEI activities. The plan described in this special communication has important limitations. Notably, the intended purpose of our plan is to evaluate systematic solutions to help a broad swath of people from different backgrounds, rather than exploring targeted interventions aimed at individuals from specific diversity or professional groups. Our intention is to allow this framework to generalize across many different organizational or departmental contexts, but we recognize that more tailored approaches may be necessary to achieve maximum impact for certain groups or within certain settings.",

First, attendees at the HSR all-staff meeting represent only a cross section (approximately 30%) of all HSR employees. Furthermore, poll participation was not mandatory and only a subset of attendees (approximately one-half) responded to these questions during the meeting. As a result, poll respondent perceptions of the DEI plan may not be representative of HSR employees as a whole. However, the distribution of women (59.3% of meeting participants vs. 58.6% of all HSR employees) and underrepresented minority participants (5.6% vs. 5.4% of all employees) were roughly equivalent, increasing our confidence in the generalizability of these findings to the department as a whole. Of note, this low proportion of underrepresented minority departmental members was part of the impetus for this plan. In addition, we conducted multiple comparisons between different groups, potentially limiting the statistical validity of these findings. Again, this was driven by the applied purpose of informing development of the plan within the department, and so we intentionally sought insights from multiple groups on specific plan components. Finally, the predetermined list of personal and professional diversity groups in which poll respondents could self-disclose membership during the poll was not exhaustive and may have excluded the perspectives of other groups, including persons with disabilities, older adults, persons from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, and others. Based on the authors' experience, including these groups would be an important consideration for anyone considering this method of prioritizing DEI plan components.",

Given this prominence on the national agenda, many organizations, including Mayo Clinic [28] , have expressly committed to taking action to address and eradicate racism.

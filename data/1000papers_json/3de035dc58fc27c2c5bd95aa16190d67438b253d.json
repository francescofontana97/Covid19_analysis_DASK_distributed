During this emergency period, the restricted human dealings with nature have appeared as blessing for health of the total environment. The variation of atmospheric O 3 may modulate the range of UV index (UVI) at any region of the earth. The objective of the study is to examine the variation of UV index over the megacities of India with respect to tropospheric O 3 level modification during COVID-19 lockdown. The meteorological or environmental data (temperature in\u00b0C , gust in km/h, wind speed km/h, relative humidity in %, air pressure in mb and cloud cover in okta) of four selective megacities of India (Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai) during and pre lockdown period have been obtained to comprehend about the variation of UV index and tropospheric O 3 . The descriptive statistical applications i.e. standard deviation, standard errors and K-means clustering have been done through standard statistical software. In the present study, t-test has been used to understand level of significance of surface O 3 and UVI during pre-lockdown (2019) and lockdown (2020) phase. The result shows that the four major megacities in India namely New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai have experienced the vibrant diminution in terms of the concentration of UV index with slightly increasing the tropospheric O 3 level during the lockdown phase. The higher accumulation of O 3 during the lockdown in the lower atmosphere of four megacities does not exceed the permissible limit. The excess amount of O 3 has remarkably contributed to trap the harmful UV radiation which has lowered the UVI in these worst polluted megacities of India. In the meantime, the prominent reduction of NO x during the lockdown period decreases the titration impact to O 3 and this mechanism helps to revitalize the ozone concentration level. The uniqueness of the current study is highlighted the ground reality regarding reduction of UV index and amplification of tropospheric O 3 concentration during lockdown phase. This study definitely assists to make new environmental policy, act and law for recover the health of the total environment.",

On 30th January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 disease as sixth Public Health Emergency of International Concern considering its devastating consequences all over the world (Wee et al. 2020; WHO 2020a) . COVID-19 emerged from novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and it has been designated as pandemic on 11th March 2020 by WHO (WHO 2020b). After detecting the first confirmed case in December 2019 at Wuhan city in China (Huang et al. 2020a, b; Zhou et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2020) , the fatal contagion is gushed speedily through physical contacts. In this regard, maintenance of social isolation is highly required to prevent the deadly impacts of this noxious infectious disease and worldwide almost all governments have imposed this social distancing norms to combat the disastrous outbreak of COVID-19 (Huang et al. 2020a, b; Bera et al. 2021) .India holds the leading position in the list of world's worst affected countries with 46,188 deaths and 23,28,405 confirmed cases as of 11th August, 2020 (https://www.covid19india. orgcovid19india.org). In India, social distancing rules and Extended author information available on the last page of the article lockdown has been strictly imposed from 25th March 2020 and then it has been extended up to 31st May 2020 into four phases to fight with the menace of coronavirus during this acute crisis period.",

            "text": "During the lockdown period, the halting of transport movement, industrial activities and power generation ensure the cleanliness of atmosphere, refurbishment of ozone layer and purification of the total environment (Chakraborty and Maity 2020; Chakraborty et al. 2021a, b) . Although, the health and economic sectors must fight against the noxious effects of COVID-19while the pausing of anthropogenic activities restrains the magnitude of pollution (Dutheil et al. 2020) . It must be remarkable that the global atmospheric quality as well as health of total environment has been restored at a certain limit because of restricted burnings of fuels, partly shut down of industrial production and transportation activities (Muhmmad et al. 2020) . The usage of energy resources and consumption of materials is effectively dwindled due to the imposition of long-term lockdown (Jribi et al. 2020) . It must be stated that the alteration of NO 2 level is remarkably prominent over Asian countries during COVID-19 lockdown while in India NO 2 is sharply reduced by 70% amidst this global emergency (Gautam 2020) . The previous study has pointed out that the concentration of SO 2 , NO 2 , CO 2 , O 3 , PM 10 and PM 2.5 has been investigated over the 22 cities of India during the month of March and April, 2020 in comparison with the identical time frame during 2017 and this assessment depicts the cheering picture in terms of air quality up gradation during lockdown period (Sharma et al.2020) . In this context, it must be mentioned that ozone (O 3 ) is a significant parameter for examining the air quality modifications. During COVID-19 lockdown phase, O 3 accumulation is substantially amplified over Yangtze river delta area in China and Sao Paulo in Brazil (Nakada and Urban 2020) which is considered as a positive sign for ecological wellbeing. In Kolkata Metropolitan city (India), SO 2 , NO 2 , CO, PM 2.5 and PM 10 have been amazingly lowered during lockdown period while concentration of O 3 is magnified to some extent compared with the prelockdown period (Bera et al. 2020 ). In the atmosphere, O 3 has a crucial contribution in the aspect of physicochemical mechanisms over troposphere, nevertheless it plays a vital role to intensify the oxidizing capability of the lower atmosphere. The surface O 3 may exert detrimental impacts for natural vegetation, agricultural yields along with animal community and mankind (Bates 1994; Finlayson-Pitts and Pitts 1997; Hogsett et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2003; Garcia et al. 2005; Jerrett et al. 2009; Nishanth et al. 2014 )and its presence exceeds the permissible limit (200 lg/m 3 or 0.2 mg/m 3 or 0.1 ppm) in the troposphere (Bera et al. 2020 ).The tropospheric O 3 is categorised as secondary air pollutant and its origin is related with the composite photochemical procedures in the existence of volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) which regulate the balance of surface O 3 Crutzen 1977, 1978; Garcia et al. 2005) .Several previous research reports highlighted that maximum accumulation of O 3 had been recorded during the ending phase of autumn and entire winter season and this phenomenon is continued over the month of May in India (Varshney and Aggarwal1992; Lal et al. 2000; Naja and Lal 2002; Nair et al. 2002; Jain et al. 2005; Beig et al. 2007; Ghude et al. 2008) .",

Ultraviolet radiation is divided into three categories i.e. UV-A (315-400 nm), and . Atmospheric ozone has the potentiality to engross all types of UV-C rays and the captivation capacity of O 3 has been augmented in terms of the reduction in wavelength of UV-B radiation (Fioletov et al. 2010) . UV radiation is the principal and highly avoidable threat for skin cancer of innumerable people globally. This harmful radiation can weaken the human immunity system and it is severely injurious for eyes and skin (Meves et al. 2003) .Ultraviolet or UV index (UVI) had been introduced to estimate the diurnal magnitude of UVR at a certain point of time and space in a consistent manner (Gies et al. 2018 (Gies et al. 2018) .The magnitude of UVI is generally persisted at higher range over the tropical regions compared with the poles. The highly populous megacities of India are not the exception in this aspect as they also register the greater range of Solar Ultraviolet Index. The fact is noteworthy that the variation in atmospheric O 3 level may modulate the range of UVI at any region of the earth surface. In this context, it must be stated that the four major megacities in India namely Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai have experienced the vibrant modifications in terms of the toxic air pollutants concentration including O 3 during the lockdown phase (Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) 2020; Sharma et al. 2020; Lau et al. 2020; Bera et al. 2020) .The significance of the study is brought the variation and correlation between tropospheric O 3 and UV index and how the meteorological or environmental factors played a significant role for slight reduction of the concentration of UV index. The current study shows that the consumption of O 3 is declined due to restrict of NO release and it recovers the accumulation status of O 3 in the troposphere. Such study will definitely assist to policy makers for sustainable management of the health of the total environment. Despite the positive sides of the scientific study, some limitations have been experienced like micro level data unavailability and lack of laboratory facilities during pandemic situation. The main objectives of the study are (1) to examine the variation of UV index (in New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai) and (2) to comprehend the correlation between tropospheric O 3 and UV index during COVID-19 lockdown compared with the preceding year along with role of meteorological or environmental factors.",

Moreover, K-means clustering technique has been used to find out the similarities among the four selective megacities in terms of ground-level O 3 and UVI concentration during (2020) and pre lockdown (2019) period. K-means clustering is a simplest unsupervised machine learning algorithm which is applied in this study through statistical software. It also attempts to develop the intra cluster data points as similar as possible. The process of k-means clustering is called the Expectation Maximization. K-means clustering also calculates the values of iterates and centroids until the researches can find the value of optimal centroid. Here, the total no. of clusters is specified by the algorithm on the basis of number of data points. After that it will calculate the cluster centroids. Next, the sum of square distance has been calculated between the centroids and also the data points. After that the cluster has been assigned to the each data point on the basis of closeness of centroids. Subsequently, two parameters have been selected here such as the tropospheric ozone and UVI for two different years like pre lockdown (2019) and lockdown (2020). Here, two is the value of k and the result of the k-means cluster analysis is very much significant because the p values of the cluster are highly significant with 0.004 (first cluster) and 0.009 (Second cluster) respectively. Criterion of iteration is an iterative approach that mainly helps and improved the quality of the classification of this unsupervised machine learning algorithm by removing, dividing and re-clustering methods. This process is also known as iterative k-means minus-plus. The main objective of the K-means clustering is to make a partition on the datasets into the defined number of clusters on the basis of clusters centroids. It can give us clear divisions of the data set. K-means clustering also applied here for the partitioning of the UVI and O3 data into different clusters. K-means clustering is following as-Assignment step (It means to divide the observations according to Voronoi diagram)",

Therefore, it has been demonstrated that the concentration of tropospheric O 3 is magnified amidst the lockdown session that is statistically tested or significant. Beside this, in case of UVI during 2019 the value of mean and standard error mean (SE) is 12.5789 and 0.06506 respectively whereas in the year of 2020 the value of mean and SE is 11.9913 and 0.06960 correspondingly Tables 1, 4) . The dendrogram also discriminates the year wise data of different megacities. The dendrogram depicts us the major variation in the above-mentioned parameters and it mainly generates two major distinct groups like pre-lockdown (2019) and lockdown (2020) that can easily show the variability in the datasets (Fig. 9 ). It has been verified that the intensity of UVI is declined during the lockdown period which has been statistically tested or significant. Thus, statistical analysis established that the lockdown system has a notable impact upon the modification of tropo-sphericO 3 and UVI index. Similarly, the K-means clustering method has portrayed a prominent similarity in the context of ground-level O 3 accumulation and UVI range over the selective megacities during lockdown scenario in 2020.On the other side, during the pre-lockdown session in the year 2019 the concentration status of the two parameters over the four megacities illustrates the completely Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment distinct scenario. The K-means cluster algorithms have grouped New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai in two separate clusters individually for lockdown and pre-lockdown phase. The K-means clustering algorithm can be subdivided the dataset of different megacities of different years into distinct homogeneous groups. That can categorize the data into different parts (pre lockdown and lockdown) and can improve the data variability of different periods (Table 5 ).",

            "text": "The solar spectrum is characterized with 100 nm to 400 nm wavelengths and it is demarcated as ultraviolet radiation (Hu et al. 2007 ). The unprecedented exaggeration of UV radiation penetration in the earth surface is an issue of serious concern as the UV ray exerts dreadful effects on every sphere of natural environment. The range of UV index is accentuated with the increase of altitude while the diurnal maximum concentration of UV ray is recorded at noon due to the perpendicular angle of solar radiation. Seasonally, the highest intensity of UV ray is measured during spring and summer whereas the minimal presence of UV radiation is registered during winter. The wavelength of UV ray which invades to the surface of the earth is varied within 290 nm to 400 nm (Chady\u0161iene et al. 2005) . The entire UV-A radiation reaches to the earth's surface as there is no incident of UV-A absorption by atmospheric ozone (Tan et al. 2018) while UV-C is wholly engrossed by ozone and oxygen in the upper and middle portion of the atmosphere (Chandra and Mcpeters 1994) . Stratospheric ozone can absorb UV-B very effectively though about 10% radiation falls upon the earth's surface (Madronich et al. 1998; Hu et al. 2007 ). In the current study, it must be noteworthy that in the lower part of the atmosphere with the higher intensity of ozone concentration can oscillate the range of UV index over the tropical region like India. During the COVID-19 lockdown period, the strengthening of tropospheric ozone over New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai has been instigated to drop the UV index compared with the preceding year, 2019. Commonly, the natural presence of surface O 3 is confined around 0.04 parts per million (ppm) which is not injurious for human (Bera et al. 2020 ). The fact is notable that higher accumulation of O 3 during the lockdown phase in the lower atmosphere of four megacities did not cross the permissible limit. The excess amount of O 3 absorbed the harmful UV radiation and as a result, the UVI has been reduced in these worst polluted megacities of India. During lockdown, the partial halting of industrial activities, vehicle movement, constructional works, burning of fuels markedly dwindle the concentration of lethal air pollutants like NO 2 , NO, CO and VOC in the atmosphere of these tremendously polluted cities (Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) 2020; Sharma et al. 2020) . Different anthropogenic activities like burning of fossil fuel, heating activities in industrial furnace, diesel combustion expand the accumulation of air pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NO x ) over extremely polluted cities (Barck et al. 2005; Carslaw2005; Carslaw and Beevers 2004a, b) . Generally, the concentration of CO and NO 2 is significantly dropped in the major megacities of India due to the restricted industrial and transport activities during the quarantine phase compared with the pre-lockdown phase (Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) 2020; Bera et al. 2020 ). In the atmosphere, around 90% of nitrogen is released as nitric oxide (NO) while \\ 10% nitrogen is produced in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). The existence of surface O 3 is dependent on the share of production and annihilation of NO as O 3 has the competency to speedily react with nitric oxide (Vellingiri et al. 2015) . The consumption of O 3 is reduced due to curtail of NO emission and it improves the accumulation status of O 3 in the troposphere (Andrade et al. 2017; Tob\u00edas et al. 2020) . Meanwhile, the prominent reduction of NO x during the lockdown period brings the titration impact to O 3 and this mechanism helps to revitalize the ozone concentration level in the atmosphere . Alongside, another is also curtailed in the lower atmosphere over Indian cities due to the closure of its human-induced sources like yield of petroleum and natural gas (Gilman et al. 2013; Petron et al. 2012) , transport activities (Russo et al. 2010) , wood combustion (Kansal2009), industrial production (Gilman et al. 2009 )during lockdown session (Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) 2020). As the above-mentioned pollutants (NO x , VOC, CO) are regarded as the chief responsible ingredients in formation process of surface O 3 and their lesser existence promotes to rejuvenate O 3 level in the lower atmosphere over the four selective megacities of India during the lockdown period in comparison with prelockdown state. In this context, the fact must be mentioned that the changing pattern of various meteorological elements like temperature, pressure, relative humidity, wind speed and direction can modify the creation and destruction process of surface O 3 (Due\u00f1as et al. 2002; Elminir2005; Satsangi et al. 2004 ). The meteorological factors like relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction have diverse effects on ozone concentration at the ground level of the atmosphere. Present study showed that ground level ozone concentrations expand the increase of temperature; though, it is not significantly connected to relative air humidity. Nevertheless, the wind direction has the great influence on the deviation of ozone concentrations. As a result, sometimes ground-level O 3 may be slightly decreased instead of the steady decline of NO x , VOC, CO in the lower atmosphere and this exceptional phenomenon has been recorded at Chennai in the month of May during lockdown. On the other side, the notable fact is that the UVI over the four major megacities in India is fluctuated between the range of 9 and 13 during the lockdown phase in 2020 and it showed very high to extreme risk of damage Fig. 11 Correlation of UVI and O3 with climatological factors over Kolkata and Mumbai during (2020) and pre-lockdown (2019) phase Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment from uncovered solar exposure. But the intensity of UV radiation coming to the earth surface is markedly dropped as a consequence of ground-level O 3 amplification over the selective megacities amidst lockdown period in compared with pre-lockdown year. It is an important provisional incident for the health of the total environment.",

The matter is mostly remarkable that amidst the unusual and unpleasant situation during COVID-19 lockdown, the accumulation of various air pollutants such as NO 2 , NO, CO, SO 2 , PM 10 , PM 2.5 and O 3 have been considerably altered due to the temporary pausing of industrial function, transportation activities and several man-made actions and this air quality modifications assist to eradicate the fatal impurities in the atmospheric arena. The study demonstrates that satisfactory changes in air quality standard accentuate the surface ozone concentration within the desirable limit which influences to cut down the UV index to some extent in different corners of India during lockdown phase. Although the excessive amount of ground-level ozone is undoubtedly hazardous for living organisms including human-being and it is labelled as ''bad ozone''. But it plays crucial role to diminish UV index level and it is highly appreciable for nourishing environmental health if the O 3 concentration is confined within the permissible limit. In this context, it must be opined that the lockdown system is definitely accountable for the massive devastation in global economic and socio-cultural aspects; however the glimpse of total environmental restoration has been brightened specifically during this unfamiliar quarantine session. Worldwide the fact is highly admitted that the excessively populous as well as worst polluted cities and countries including Indian megacities momentarily reclaim their environmental transparencies and ecological stability during the lockdown period. Then, the environmentalists and scientists have opined to initiate the partial lockdown as the sacred blessings towards every spheres of environment. More scientific research and development are highly required regarding the variation and spatiotemporal concentration of UVI and tropospheric ozone for the protection of humans from hazardous UV radiation. So, it is fact that the effectiveness of short-term lockdown system should be recognized to ensure the long-term sustainable environmental management as well as ecological renovation for the extremely polluted megacities of India.",

Fundamentally, the Global Solar Ultraviolet Index (UVI) defines the intensity of ultraviolet ray upon the surface of the earth and the high range of UVI indicates the speedy and acute damaging impact on human health (World Health Organization, World Meteorological Organization, United Nations Environment Programme International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection 2002).The UVI assists to analyse the ultraviolet related morbidities and contributes to develop a robust perception among human being about their vulnerability towards the risk of UVR",

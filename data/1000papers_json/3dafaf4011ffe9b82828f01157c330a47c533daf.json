The PCR was selective for the ITS2 region of C. auris. The cyclin parameters were kept consistent with the manufacturer's instructions. A cycle threshold cutoff of 40 was used. An internal laboratory validation showed 100% sensitivity and specificity with a limit of detection of 10 2 CFU/mL (manuscript under review).",

Five microliters of each sample were pooled, denatured, and diluted; 600\u00b5L were loaded into the reagent cartridge. The Illumina MiSeq System was used to produce 250 bp paired-end reads. Data were uploaded to the Illumina BaseSpace cloud and de-multiplexed. Six C. auris isolates from five patients were sequenced; sequences were uploaded to GenBank under the BioProject: PRJNA672695. UCLA_A1 was isolated from an inguinal/axillary swab of patient A on October 8, 2019 (GenBank accession no. SRR12916694). UCLA_A2 was isolated from a tracheal suction specimen of patient A on October 8, 2019 (GenBank accession no. SRR12916693). UCLA_C1 was isolated from an inguinal/axillary swab of patient C on August 12, 2020 (GenBank accession no. SRR12916692). UCLA_D1 was isolated from an inguinal/axillary swab of patient D on August 19, 2020 (GenBank accession no. SRR12916691). UCLA_E1 was isolated from an inguinal/axillary swab of patient E on August 31, 2020 (GenBank accession no. SRR12916690). UCLA_F1 was isolated from a right pleural fluid specimen of patient F on September 3, 2020 (GenBank accession no. SRR12916689). Bioinformatics and Phylogenetic Analyses CLC Genomics Workbench version 12.0.3 was used to pair, trim, and map the sequence reads. Reads were mapped to a reference C. auris complete genome (ATCC MYA-5022, GenBank accession no. CP043531); this strain is part of Clade III. The number of sequence reads ranged from 1,056,808-6,212,112. The percent of reads mapped to the reference genome ranged from 93.82%-96.33%. The percent of the reference genome with at least 10\u00d7 coverage of mapped reads ranged from 91.90%-97.74%.",

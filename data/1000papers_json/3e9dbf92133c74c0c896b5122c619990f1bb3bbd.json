As of June 21, 2020 there are 12,929,306 confirmed cases and 569,738 confirmed deaths across 216 countries, areas or territories. The scale of spread and impact of the pandemic left many nations grappling with preventive and curative approaches. The infamous lockdown measure introduced to mitigate the virus spread has altered many aspects of our social routines in which demand for online-based services skyrocketed. As the virus propagate, so does misinformation and fake news around it via online social media, which seems to favour virality over veracity. With a majority of the populace confined to their homes for a long period, vulnerability to the toxic impact of online misinformation is high. A case in point is the various myths and disinformation associated with the Covid-19, which, if left unchecked, could lead to a catastrophic outcome and hamper the fight against the virus.",

The latest update from the WHO at the time of writing this paper reported 12,929,306 confirmed cases and 569,738 confirmed deaths across 216 countries, areas or territories 3 . As cases for the Covid-19 increase, so does the associated infodemic. It can be argued that the need for online-based services has never been in higher demand as being witnessed in the Covid-19induced lockdown era. In this technology-driven society, online social networks support various forms of interactions that play a crucial role in enabling global connectivity. Because various aspects of our social lives have been affected during the pandemic with substantial reliance on online-based services, people are more vulnerable to misleading online information. While various credible bodies strive to contain the outbreak with sound and cautious approaches, various misinformation and fake news sources exist, playing a role in misleading the public. The proliferation of misinformation and uncensored posts on social media platforms 4 are being supported by a communication system that is focused on generating a huge amount of data (virality) at the expenses of vitality. Despite the efforts to curtail the spread of unsubstantiated claims, such as Twitter's new feature of flagging posts, it is still difficult to ascertain the veracity of the information we consume. As a result, there is huge interest at various levels to combat the pandemic.",

This opens up another frontier of challenge in the fight against the virus in the form of misinformation, fake news and unfounded claims. To this end, researchers have been curating and documenting various datasets about Covid-19. We observe that there is limited availability of curated ground-truth data that could be used to debunk myths and misinformation around the pandemic. Moreover, the existing tweet-based corpora, discussed in Section 1.1, need to comprise of various relevant stakeholders. This paper aims at addressing this gap by making available various datasets about Covid-19.

Due to the multifaceted nature of the datasets, we use the following approach to transform them so that they all conform to a unified format for redistribution. The tweet-based collections are messy and difficult to use directly [8] , hence the need for data cleaning. We carried out a rudimentary cleaning process involving tokenisation, stopwords removal and text formatting. To separate content words from function words and improve analysis, we normalise each contracted term to its expanded version. Finally, lemmatisation, the process of converting the inflected form of words back to their base forms, is performed on the normalised content words. 8 using the BeautifulSoup package, available at www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup 9 This ranges from debunking myths to protective measures. 10 see https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy 11 The data presented in this paper are available at https://github.com/ijdutse/covid19-datasets 4 we query the following accounts as the seed users: @PlanB1975, @simondolan, @LonsdaleKeith, @angiebUK, @HotelLubyanka, @jcho710 Collection 4 Non-tweet-based collection Data Source WHO, NHS-UK, NCDC-NGN, and CDC-US Popular accounts and hashtags. Figure 1 shows a timeline of popular tweets over time during the collection period. The y-axis denotes the frequency of tweets and the x-axis denotes the popular hashtags and the corresponding dates in the title. While some of the hashtags are expected, many derogatory ones stand out in the miscellaneous collection, as shown in Figure 3 . With Figure 1 showing the popularity of the sources or hashtags, many questions can be answered. For instance, how does the online popularity corroborate with offline relevance? For the tweets posted by the monitored accounts, in the account-based collection, we determine its online pres- Ranking Hashtags. Because of the prevalence of many related hashtags in the collection, as demonstrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2 , we retain only the most frequent ones in the posts to enable a complete textual analysis. As a result, each tweet is merged with its corresponding hashtag text and a form of synonym resolution is performed on the hashtags. For instance #covid-19 and #CoronaVirus would be similar after the resolution. We apply Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) [9, 10] , a popular topic modelling method, to analyse further the full context of tweets in the corpus and hashtags ranking. Topic models such as the LSA and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [11] are widely used in various tasks involving texts [12, 13, 14] . The set of original hashtags are compared with the output of the ranked hashtag computed by the LSA and are replaced accordingly. For instance, since the LSA produces a ranked subset of the most relevant hashtags from the original set, we make a comparison and replace the set of hashtag with a single highly ranked hashtag as the best representative of the set. For those without exact representation, the first hashtag in the list is used. Figures 1, 2 and 3 show some relevant hashtags in the tweetbased collection.",

Accordingly, we provide a summary of the relevant themes or topics and the corresponding sentiment in Figures 5 to 7 . Due to the high frequency of terms related to the pandemic, e.g., covid-19 and coronavirus, we remove such variations to avoid the extinction of other relevant terms in the data. Alongside the themes, we present the sentiment associated with the posts, reporting on different levels of polaritynegative, neutral, positive and overall sentiment. Negative topics often relate to reports about fatalities and confirmed cases. The positive collection contains many instances about reported cases from different regions, as shown in the word clouds 14 , in Figures 5 to 7) .",

On the other hand, content from recognised sources, such as the WHO, would remain relatively consistent and slow 13 n is any positive integer, e.g. 1, 2 and 3 for unigrams, bigrams and trigrams, respectively. 14 Word cloud visualisation is based on: https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud to change due to the formal process and other health-related protocols or standard practices that apply before posting. Moreover, lexical richness can be viewed as a measure of consistency in the narration about the pandemic. A longitudinal analysis of the richness of content may provide a glimpse of what is happening. Figure 4 shows both sentiment intensity, in the first three subplots, and lexical richness, in the last sub-plot, across the tweet-based collections. Indeed, the observed result confirmed our intuition, showing low richness in the account-based collection, which contains tweets that mostly come from credible sources (see Table 1 ). Figures 5, 6 and 7 show some examples from the topic analysis in form of the most relevant terms in the collections.",

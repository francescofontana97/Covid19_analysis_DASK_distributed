The aim of this work was to evaluate the subjective burden, the perception of the information policies, and the agreement on structural measures in a large cohort of German HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. This country-wide anonymous online survey was carried out from April 15th until May 1st, 2020. 25 content-related questions regarding the subjective burden and other dimensions were evaluated. We evaluated different dimensions of subjective burden, stress, and perspectives using 5-point Likert-scale questions. Moreover, the individual COVID-19 infection status, the amount of people infected in circle of friends and acquaintances and the hours working overtime were assessed. A total of 3669 HCWs provided sufficient responses for analyses. 2.8% of HCWs reported to have been tested positive for COVID-19. Nurses reported in principle higher ratings on all questions of subjective burden and stress than doctors and other hospital staff. Doctors (3.6%) and nurses (3.1%) were more likely to be tested positive for COVID-19 than other hospital staff (0.6%, Chi 2",

One cross-sectional study among 1257 Chinese HCWs in 34 national hospitals involved in the management of COVID-19 patients reported a significant psychological burden, especially among female nurses. Furthermore, self-report ratings indicated increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress [4] . Another cross-sectional study from China compared 234 frontline nurses with 294 non-frontline nurses and showed a higher rate of vicarious traumatization among non-frontline nurses [5] . Moreover, one cross-sectional study with a 1-month observation period among 180 medical professionals from Wuhan involved in the management of COVID-19 reported high levels of stress-related symptoms that were associated with deteriorated sleep quality [6] . An online-study investigated anxiety symptoms among 85 Iranian nurses showed high rates of anxiety regarding their own well-being and of their respective families [7] . Related findings were reported in an online survey conducted among 1257 Italian HCWs [8] . These findings are in line with the findings from previous epidemic and pandemic outbreaks as detailed above. However, large-scale evaluations of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of HCWs in highincome economies and the differentiation between professional groups are sparse.",

On the other hand, low scores of agreement were reported with regard to a lack of time in personal life (question 24) and a reduced sleep quality (question 30). Evaluating structural factors of the hospitals, participants rated the information policy, the measures taken by the hospitals to provide safety equipment (question 19), the communication strategy (questions 20), and the preparation of the hospital for the pandemic (questions 22) mostly positive. Importantly, low ratings emerged for the question of feeling left alone by the employer (question 13) and most participants strongly agreed that they are willing to continue working in the healthcare system after the pandemic (question 33).

Interestingly, the majority of participants reported no substantial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on subjective sleep quality. Recent publications from Italy and China also showed increased levels of self-reported stress during the COVID-19 pandemic [4, 8] . In contrast to our findings, those publications also indicate high levels of insomnia possibly pointing towards the hypothesis that HCWs in Germany experienced less severe mental stress during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other countries. Against our expectations and in principle in contrast to international media reports, the general response patterns indicate in general positive evaluations of the communication policies, the level of support and protection, and the quality of care for patients with and without a COVID-19 infection. The availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) for HCWs who face an increased risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing and tremendously debated issue [11, 12] and in many countries the lack of PPE has been defined as a source of anxiety among HCWs (e.g., US media reports [13, 14] ). However, German HCWs rated the overall availability of e.g. PPE as positive (question 19).",

Despite the fact that no relevant differences in response patterns between males and females were detected, gender differences should be acknowledged when comparing nurses with doctors. One recent meta-analysis of 13 studies (12 studies conducted in China and one in Singapore) comprising a total of 33062 participants showed that female HCWs and nurses might exhibit higher rates of negative affective symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak [20] . Our findings are in line with the meta-analytic evidence, but show for the first time this relationship in a large-scale database from a European perspective. Irrespective of the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses, especially those working in inpatient settings, are presumed to experience a high amount of stress and report reduced satisfaction with their jobs [21] .

Factors that may increase the stress particular in this group include the lack of PPE, concerns regarding the individual future, the feeling to have less control of the situation, the safety of the individual families, and the risk to catch the virus in the respective special working environment [22] . However, despite these higher agreement rates, only a few questions reached significance level (see Table 4 ) indicating a high level of professional and personal competence. In this context, one must acknowledge that the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany was less dramatic than in the other European countries. Finally, the values for increased working hours must be interpreted within caution taking into account the German perspective. All hospitals had to stop all routine procedures and operations following governmental resolutions and some hospitals to be prepared for COVID-19 patients. Thus, many HCWs did not report an increase in working hours as many hospital beds were empty during the study period.

Second, we did not use validated questionnaires. Third, we had no control group of non-HCWs. Assuming that the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the well-being of all people, the specificity of our findings needs to be set into the societal perspective. However, we calculated contrasts between different groups of HCWs and were able to show meaningful differences between our different study groups. Moreover, our findings are not controlled for pre-existing mental conditions and otherwise adverse individual life circumstances (e.g., substance abuse or financial worries) highlighting the need to confirm our findings in future studies using direct interviews. Next, the lacking longitudinal design poses a further limitation as we cannot evaluate whether those HCWs with high rankings for subjective psychological burden or those feeling themselves abandoned are at an increased risk to develop stress-related disorders. The advantage of our survey is that we were able to receive answers from a large cohort of HCWs, that our sample size exceeds the sample size of other international surveys conducted during the COVID-19 or other pandemics, and that we were able to show profession-specific differences in mental-health burden.",

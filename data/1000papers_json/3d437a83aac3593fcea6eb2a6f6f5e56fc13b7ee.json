            "text": "mainly consists of two stages: (1) creating reasonable networks for the interested 19 healthcare service systems and (2) identifying the influential nodes in the created 20 networks. 21 Much research has been conducted to abstract healthcare systems as networks, 22 and most of this research has focused on creating \"patient-sharing networks\" based both deliver care to the same patient and examined the approaches to conceptual-43 izing, measuring, and analyzing provider patient-sharing networks. 44 There are typically two procedures in identifying influential nodes in the cre-45 ated networks: (1) ranking nodes according to nodal influence measure metrics, 46 such as degree centrality [11] , clustering coefficients [12] , H-Index [13, 14] , and 47 k-shell [15, 16] ; and (2) evaluating the influence of top-ranked nodes by compar- 48 ing the structures and functions before and after removing a certain percentage of 49 top-ranked nodes. 50 Currently, many algorithms have been proposed for identifying influential nodes. In this paper, we propose a network-based method with privacy-preserving The novelty of the proposed method can be explained as follows. As mentioned 79 above, most of the related research is based on patient-sharing networks, which 80 are created according to electronic medical claims, focusing on the sharing of pa-81 tient information between providers. The advantage of creating patient-sharing 82 networks is that they are quite precise. However, the data of electronic medical 83 claims are personal and private [32, 33] , and the data are generally not directly 84 available to the public. Healthcare organizations need to consider regulations and 85 rules of privacy in regard to patient information. Researchers need to deal with 86 personal privacy information carefully before creating the required patient-sharing 87 network.",

Ranking of the Influential Nodes 204 In network science, one of the most important research areas is how to rank 205 influential nodes in a complex network [38]. It is interesting to rank nodes when 206 there are a massive number of nodes and find the vital providers that have a strong 207 impact on the function and efficiency of the whole network. For example, it is 208 possible to replace the missing vital nodes in a timely manner to protect the network 209 from paralysis and maintain the stability of the medical system [39].210 Moreover, Gao et al [40] proposed a local structural centrality measure to rank 211 the spreading ability of nodes in the network. Zhao et al [41] proposed the IM-LPA 212 algorithm to solve the influence maximization problem in social networks with 213 a community structure. Mo et al [42] proposed a new comprehensive centrality 214 measure based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. algorithms can be roughly divided into two categories: one is based 216 on local nodal influence metrics such as the degree centrality, and the other is based 217 on global metrics such as the betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and k-218 shell metrics [43]. 219 In this paper, after considering the ranking metrics that are relatively suit-220 able for undirected weighted provider-interacting networks, four nodal influential 221 metrics are used to rank nodes, including (1) the degree centrality [11] , measured by the degree of a node, which can directly reflect the possi-226 bility of the node having direct contact with other nodes in the network (Eq. indicates the DC of node v i and K i indicates the degree of node v i . To 228 reflect the function of weighted edges, we specify how many HCPCS codes are 229 the same between nodes v i and v j , and how many connecting edges are there be-230 tween nodes v i and v j . When calculating the DC of node v i , the number of added 231 connected edges can be equivalent to the number of increased neighbors. For a 232network where node v i has n connected edges, the maximum degree of a node is 233 n\u22121. After the node is divided by n\u22121 for normalization, there is 0 \u2264 DC i \u2264 1.234The larger the value is, the stronger the centrality of the nodes is [37].235(2) Companion Behaviors (CB)236    The local metric CB was originally proposed byMei et al [12]  and is based on 237 the calculation of Jaccard Coefficients (JCs) of edges.

Impact Evaluation of the Identified Influential Nodes 277 There are two typical categories of indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of 278 influential node ranking algorithms: (1) the propagation dynamics of the network 279 and (2) the resilience (also called the robustness) of the network [30]. The re-280 silience is a system's ability to adjust its activity to retain its basic functionality 281 when errors, failures, and environmental changes occur [45]. 282 The research on network resilience due to external damage such attacks has 283 drawn much attention in network science [46]. In general, there are two kinds 284 of attacks on complex networks: random attacks and selective attacks. Random 285 attacks mean that nodes are randomly removed with a certain probability, while 286 selective attacks mean that nodes or edges are selectively deleted in a certain way 287 [47]. Research on the structural robustness of network nodes subjected to random 288 failures or malicious attacks has been widely studied [28]. the concept of network resilience, in this paper, we employ three in-290 dicators, including the maximum connectivity coefficient, network efficiency, and 291 susceptibility, to quantify the impact of selective removal of top-ranked influential 292 nodes on the network structure and function. We abstract this situation as node 293 deletion due to the influential provider's own reasons (such as retirement or resig-294 nation) or other external factors. The results can be examined in two aspects: (a) 295 the connectivity of the network has been damaged; and (b) the efficiency of the net-296 work has declined, resulting in the network not meeting the business requirements. Maximum connectivity coefficient 298 The maximum connectivity coefficient of a network can be calculated by first 299 ranking the nodes according to the nodal influence metrics from the largest to the 300 smallest and then observing the impact of removing a part of the nodes on the giant 301 connected component (Eq. (9)). 302 G = R/N (9) where N represents the total number of nodes in the network and R represents the 303 giant connected component. The smaller the scale of the giant connected compo-304",

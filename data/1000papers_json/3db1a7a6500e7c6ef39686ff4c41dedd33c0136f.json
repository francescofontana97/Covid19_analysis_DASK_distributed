            "text": "Background: Aiming to support European countries in improving their breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programmes, the EU-TOPIA consortium has developed an online user-friendly tool (the EU-TOPIA evaluation tool; https://miscan.eu-topia.org) based on the Microsimulation Screening Analysis (MIS-CAN) model. Methods: We designed an online platform that allows stakeholders to use their country-specific data (demographic, epidemiological, and cancer screening information) to quantify future harms and benefits of different cancer screening scenarios in their country. Current cancer screening programmes and impacts of potential changes in screening protocols (such as extending target ages or increasing screening attendance) can be simulated. Results are scaled to the country-specific population. To illustrate the tool, we used the tool to simulate two different CRC screening scenarios in the Netherlands: biennial fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) in ages 55-75 and colonoscopy every ten years in ages 55-75. Data from the Dutch screening programme was used to inform both scenarios. Results: A total of 482,700 CRC cases and 178,000 CRC deaths were estimated in the Netherlands with FIT screening (for individuals aged 40-100 years, 2018-2050), with 47.3 million FITs performed (1.92 million positives of which 1.64 million adhered to diagnostic colonoscopy). With colonoscopy screening, CRC incidence and mortality were, respectively, up to 17% and 14% lower than in the current FIT screening programme, requiring, however, a colonoscopy demand that was 7-fold higher. Conclusions: Our study presents an essential online tool for stakeholders and medical societies to quantify estimates of benefits and harms of early cancer detection in Europe.",

            "text": "Many of the current microsimulation models for cancer screening are proprietary, and open tools are only available for a handful of countries (Gauvreau et al., 2017) , limiting the opportunity of policymakers to use such tools for decision-making. Moreover, using simulation models requires sufficient technical proficiency in understanding the model structure and the uncertainty behind the modelling analysis (\u00c7aglayan et al., 2018) . The Microsimulation Screening Analysis (MISCAN) model, a well-established microsimulation model used in informing cancer screening decisions worldwide (Knudsen et al., 2016; de Carvalho et al., 2017; Jansen et al., 2020a; Tomonaga et al., 2018; Sankatsing et al., 2020) is one of the leading tools for decision making in cancer screening. The EU-TOPIA project (EU-Framework Programme, Horizon 2020 -634753) aims to share knowledge, create professional networks, and assist all European countries in monitoring, evaluating, and improving their screening programmes for breast cancer (BC); cervical cancer (CC); and colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus, we developed a user-friendly online tool based on the MISCAN model (EU-TOPIA Evaluation tool; https:// miscan.eu-topia.org) to allow European stakeholders (i.e. policymakers, screening programme managers, coordinators, and researchers) to predict future outcomes of BC, CC and CRC screening scenarios in their countries. In this report, we describe this online tool and illustrate its use with an example for CRC screening.",

The core structure of the CRC version of the tool was previously tested modelling the costs and benefits of the Hungarian FIT screening programme (Csan\u00e1di et al., 2020) . Detailed information on the BC and CC versions can be found on the tool's website. Application and results of the CC version of the tool were also reported in a previous publication (Jansen et al., 2021) . The current version of the tool requires a registration (Supplementary Methods Part 1), and a direct approval is granted by the EU-TOPIA team to European stakeholders involved in the field of cancer screening.",

The development and validation of those benchmark models is described in a previous publication (Gini et al., 2021) . Briefly, the models were quantified based on local data on population demography (i.e. age distribution of the population and life expectancy), disease risk (i.e. CRC incidence, stage distribution and survival) and screening programmes (i.e. design of the screening programme, participation, positivity and detection rates). Subsequently, we externally validated three out of four models against the best available regional data concerning CRC screening effectiveness on CRC mortality reduction (no regional data on screening effectiveness was available for Eastern Europe), identified in a systematic review of the literature .",

We estimated that up to an additional 14% of CRC deaths might be avoided with colonoscopy screening (every 10 years, from age 55 to 75) in the Netherlands compared to the current biennial FIT screening scenario (same target age and participation rate).

Then, we analysed potential differences in the natural history of BC, CC, and CRC among a selected number of European countries, calibrating and validating 4 MISCAN model versions (The Netherlands, Italy, Slovenia, and Finland) for each cancer (BC, CC, and CRC). Those were used as benchmarks models: i) to take into account European regional differences inside the EU-TOPIA evaluation tool; and ii) to supply regional-specific data when stakeholders are unable to collect all data from their country. Developing and validating those regional model versions, we found that the differences in CRC incidence between countries could mainly be explained by differences in onset of disease, whereas the parameters behind the progression of disease could be assumed the same across the European regions (Gini et al., 2021) .

Second, stakeholders can modify several model parameters uploading country-specific data, but some of those, such as participation in surveillance, surveillance protocol, or relative survival, could not be dynamically changed inside the tool. These could, however, be adjusted as part of the uploaded data template. Third, if screening performance indicators in a country vary meaningfully from the data and indicators used to structure the tool, this may limit and affect the reliability of the model estimates. Real-life monitoring and evaluation of cancer screening programmes therefore remains essential, especially considering the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on discontinuity of the programmes. There is remarkable uncertainty in the estimates on incidence and mortality impacts between some screening strategies (Buskermolen et al., 2019) and the modelled estimates depend respectively upon the natural history parameter values. Fourth, the EU-TOPIA evaluation tool is supported only up to the end of 2020 through funding (the EU-Framework Programme, Horizon 2020). It will remain available online, but future updates and support in interpreting the model results will be limited to European stakeholders involved in the field of cancer screening (their status will be assessed in the moment of the registration and access to the tool will be granted).",

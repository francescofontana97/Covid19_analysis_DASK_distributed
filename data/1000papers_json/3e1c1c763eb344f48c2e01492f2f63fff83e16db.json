The cause is a new strain in the coronavirus family, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 1 , SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. 2 The European Paediatric Association-Union of National European Paediatric Societies and Associations (EPA-UN-EPSA) has established a collaborative working group with key Chinese academic institutions and medical centers with the purpose of facilitating the reciprocal exchange of information and sharing scientific knowledge. The aim of this commentary by the China-EPA-UNEPSA working group is to raise awareness regarding children's psychological needs during epidemics and report early data collected in the COVID-19-affected areas in China during the current outbreak, emphasizing the role of families and caregivers in the timely recognition and management of negative emotions.",

In Europe, the first case of COVID-19 was registered in a patient hospitalized in Munich, Germany in early January 2020, following contact with a traveler from China. 5 Later, several other cases were reported in variable numbers in Germany, Spain, Italy, France, and other European countries, together representing roughly 5% of the cases of COVID-19 recorded worldwide. 4 Genetic studies on viral strains isolated from patients affected by Coronavirus infection throughout the world confirmed that they are all phylogenetically related to the original Chinese mutant strain. 6 In contrast to seasonal influenza, COVID-19 seems to cause a milder clinical infection in children than in adults or older people. Early studies have suggested that children are just as likely as older age groups to become infected with the coronavirus but are far less likely to develop severe symptoms. 7 The risk of severe disease and death is highest for seniors and those with severe health conditions, such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer, and diabetes. 7 COVID-19 has been perceived worldwide as a major threat to health and a danger to the global economy, affecting people's lives by influencing their everyday behavior and causing feelings of panic anxiety, depression, and often triggering intense dread.",

Understanding their reactions and emotions is essential to properly address their needs. A preliminary study conducted in Shaanxi Province during the second week of February 2020, which was authorized by the local authorities, showed that the most common psychological and behavioral problems among 320 children and adolescents (168 girls and 142 boys) aged 3-18 were clinginess, distraction, irritability, and fear of asking questions about the epidemic (unpublished data). Because of the Chinese government's mobility restrictions related to epidemics, as enforced by local and national authorities, the study was performed using an online questionnaire to investigate the children's behavioral and emotional responses to the current epidemics. Several children were confined at home under protective isolation because they resided in highly affected areas.",

An important factor ensuring the reliability of results collected by questionnaires investigating mental disorders in general and particularly during emergencies is the procedure for data collection and statistical analysis followed by specialized personnel responsible for data collection, registration, and statistical processing, as in this case. The use of standard statistical methods ensures the comparability of the results with other studies. 12, 13 The purpose of the questionnaire used in the Chinese study was not to establish a final diagnosis of mental disorder and depression or to monitor depression severity, but rather to screen for behavioral and emotional disorders as a \"first step\" approach. Subjects who screened positive at preliminary investigation of their behavioral and emotional condition should be included in future programs to determine whether they meet criteria for a depressive disorder.",

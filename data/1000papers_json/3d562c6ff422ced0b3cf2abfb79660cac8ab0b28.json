This has been further reinforced in recent surveys pertaining to COVID-19 vaccines [9, 11] .

Secondary aims included determining the impact of age, gender, race, active treatment, political affiliation, and other key demographics on beliefs and vaccine plans. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, means, and medians were used to analyze participant characteristics, sources of information, stated reasons for vaccine enthusiasm or hesitancy, and intentions to receive a vaccine. Automatic linear modeling for regression was used to create a predictive model of characteristics and beliefs associated with the choice to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Ensemble modeling was used to boost the ability to identify predictors for vaccine enthusiasm or hesitancy. Paired t-tests were employed to compare pre-and post-webinar survey responses from the same individuals and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

This finding has been previously reported for other vaccines, such as vaccines against influenza [13] [14] [15] .

Second, empathy gives purpose to COVID-19 vaccination. Study participants who were concerned about their family, friends, and coworkers were more likely to accept a vaccine for themselves. This worldview of human connection and shared sensibility speaks to the paradox of COVID-19 as both predator and prey to community action. Although messaging for COVID-19 vaccination has not yet incorporated empathy, the results from this study suggest that it should. One example might be \"vaccinate if not for yourself, then for others.\" A further evaluation of patient attitudes found that vaccine enthusiasm was boosted by positive impressions of safety and efficacy data of the COVID-19 vaccines. In contrast, a fear of side effects was the chief concern of vaccine-hesitant participants. This study confirms and extends prior reports showing that the most formidable impediments to vaccine acceptance are safety concerns related to adverse effects and that allaying such concerns directly supports vaccine uptake [6, 7, 9, 14, 18, 19] . This places an emphasis on high quality health communications and combating sources of misinformation. While our surveys were not designed to directly identify the role of misinformation in patient beliefs towards vaccines, some of these effects could be seen indirectly. The impact of social group influences is considered a major component of misinformation campaigns, through word of mouth and social media [20, 21] . While seen to a lesser extent in our study, both these sources of information were used by many of our webinar attendees. We believe that these sources can be co-opted for the dissemination of high-quality information to A further evaluation of patient attitudes found that vaccine enthusiasm was boosted by positive impressions of safety and efficacy data of the COVID-19 vaccines.

This study supports the effort to create and deploy public-facing programs such as our webinar that serve to educate cancer patients about vaccinations [22, 23] .",

Of these factors, a White race, older age, higher educational attainment, and higher household income may have predisposed our study population to have a higher baseline level of vaccine enthusiasm [6, 7, 9] . At the baseline, this population expressed vaccine enthusiasm. Furthermore, some participants did not respond to demographic questions, which limited analyses. In the future, a longitudinal study design capturing the impact of the webinar on physically receiving a vaccine would also add value to the study results.

            "text": "The rollout of a vaccination programme against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been one of the biggest steps towards controlling the global COVID-19 pandemic, with four new vaccines currently authorised for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Since February 2021, a preliminary report of cases of unusual thrombosis in the setting of concomitant thrombocytopenia following vaccination has emerged. 1 The authors describe nine patients in Germany and Austria who presented with clinical and serological features which mimic heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and the name vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) was initially proposed. 1 The term vaccine induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) has since been also commonly used, with the condition being referred to as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) by the CDC and FDA. Patients presented with symptomatic thrombosis, primarily cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT), and were predominantly young females. The EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) noted disproportionality for rare events such as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), CSVT and haemorrhagic stroke, especially in younger patients aged 18-54. 2 They have since acknowledged a causal association between AZD1222 (COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) and acquired coagulopathy as of 7 April 2021.",

Greinacher et al. described nine patients presenting over a period of a month with thrombosis at unusual sites in the setting of concomitant thrombocytopenia. Patients presented between 4-16 days following vaccination. Four patients underwent serological testing for platelet-activating antibodies against PF4/heparin and showed strong activation, either in the presence of PF4 or AZD1222 vaccine. One serum sample showed platelet activation in the presence of heparin. 1 As VITT appears to be a markedly prothrombotic state, despite the absence of demonstrable thrombus in our patient, we commenced empiric anticoagulation in a similar fashion to optimal management of HIT. 3 We commenced Factor Xa inhibition using apixaban, avoiding heparin, given the similar pathogenesis of VITT to HIT and the previously documented case of in-vitro cross-over activation with heparin as outlined above. Due to the paucity of data available, the optimal duration of anticoagulation is unclear, but we plan to continue anticoagulation for four weeks in a similar fashion to standard management of HIT without thrombosis.",

The clinical course highlights the importance of early recognition of this syndrome and the potential benefit of early instigation of nonheparin-based anticoagulation to avoid the development of serious thrombotic sequelae. The fact that the ELISA for heparin-PF4 IgG antibody was positive in the absence of demonstrable platelet activation in vitro, with a negative HIPA assay, was surprising but could potentially explain why our patient did not have a thrombotic event.",

Though unclear as to whether it is due to genetic, hormonal or environmental factors, antibody responses to viral and bacterial vaccines are stronger in females than in males. 4 For example, dose response studies in humans receiving inactivated influenza vaccine found that female subjects achieved antibody titres equal to that of their male counterparts when vaccinated with half the dose. 5 Thrombotic and thrombocytopenic events appear to be associated with the AZD1222 vaccine and have not yet been described with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Adenoviral vectors have been linked with thrombotic and thrombocytopenic events in pre-clinical trials involving nonhuman primate and rabbit models. 6, 7 Considering the homology which adenoviral vectors share with the replication-incompetent simian adenoviral vector ChAdOx1 8 used in AZD1222, the ChAdOx vector may be implicated in the VITT pathogenesis. Furthermore, the AZD1222 vaccine employs a tissue plasminogen activator leader sequence to enhance immunogenicity. 9 Such a sequence could, theoretically, negatively impact the fibrinolytic system with fibrinolysis, leading to a marked increase in D-dimers and hypofibrinogenaemia. Further expert discussions, data collection, monitoring and research are required to fully elucidate the relationship between the AZD1222 vaccine and VITT.",

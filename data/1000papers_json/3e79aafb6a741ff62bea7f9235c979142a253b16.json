Maternal and neonatal health, the charge of obstetrics HCPs, are two of the most important community health indicators worldwide. Today, the mental health of HCPs has been significantly affected by COVID-19 outbreak in various aspects. A recent survey reported an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and insomnia especially among female HCPs during the COVID-19 emergence, prompting psychological preventive measures or interventions. 8 Liu et al showed that medical staff members in China who had close contact with COVID-19 patients had much higher levels of anxiety and depression when compared with their counterparts who had no contact. Close contact with COVID-19 patients was also shown to negatively affect the medical staff's quality of life. 14 In contrast, a recent study conducted in Singapore found that there was higher prevalence of anxiety among non-medical healthcare workers without direct contact compared to medical personnel who might have direct contact with COVID-19 cases. The contradictory findings in Singapore could be due to the fact that COVID-19 was a less severe problem in Singapore as compared to China, and frontline healthcare workers encountered lower levels of anxiety and depression. 24 In another study by Xiao et al 25 conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was shown that medical staff's social support level was positively associated with self-efficacy and quality of sleep; however, it had a negative association with stress and anxiety.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 654, "end": 655, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1443, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the current study, the average PHQ depression scores for obstetrics HCPs with direct, no direct, and unknown contacts with pregnant women infected with COVID-19 had no statistically significant differences.

The current results also revealed that HCPs with an unknown contact status had higher scores of limitations due to physical health and due to emotional problems as compared to their counterparts with or without direct contact. During the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran, the shortage of masks and other PPEs was among the main causes of distress for HCPs all over the country. In this critical situation, HCPs who had close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases received all the required advanced PPEs, while those with no direct or unknown contact received only surgical masks and gloves. Therefore, the lack of PPEs for those HCPs who had contact with suspected cases may have led to higher limitations due to physical health and emotional problems, because this group of HCPs were worried about the contagiousness of the disease and perceived themselves to be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The results of the current study further showed that OB/GYN specialists had higher social functioning and general health scores when compared to resident physicians/medical students and nurses/midwives.

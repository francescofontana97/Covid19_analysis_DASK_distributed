Opinions about tracheal intubation for EGD and LMA use seemed somewhat less consistent, with about half of respondents agreeing with their use. A variety of barrier devices (e.g., cover box, or plastic tent) have been suggested to prevent aerosols and droplets from reaching the operator's face 7 ; one third of respondents expressed being neutral and less than 50% seemed to agree/strongly agree with their use; although we do not know how many of respondents actually tried these devices, it is possible that most perceived the use of intubation boxes to be cumbersome in challenging cases, or that knowledge surrounding the fact that their manipulation may actually redirect aerosolized particles trapped under the shield had already emerged at the time of our survey. [8] [9] [10] We acknowledge our survey has several significant limitations including the low response rate resulting in sampling bias; the fact that a majority of respondents were private practice anesthesiologists may be due to the fact that anesthesiologists working in academic centers were working at the frontline and less available to respond; overall though, a comparison of this cohort with the overall ASA membership did not show major discrepancies in representation (age, gender and location). In addition, our survey lacks information about exact location (i.e., zip code), which might have caused a sampling bias because of the wide variation in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence during the first surge at the time of our survey. Another shortcoming is the lack of information regarding case load, case mix (urgent versus elective), and availability of preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing and PPE. Last, the survey only asked about ASA members' opinions, which may not necessarily reflect their actual practice.",

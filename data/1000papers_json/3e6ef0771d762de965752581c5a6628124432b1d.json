Most live outside protected game reserves in small, isolated groups, where they are often in conflict with human interests and livestock and most populations continue to decline (Marker-Kraus et al., 1996) .",

In Namibia, between 1980 and 1991 Cheetahs were legally removed from the wild, mainly through indiscriminate catching in live traps and shooting (CITES, 1992) . Significant declines in the population have continued as farmers capture and remove Cheetahs because they are regarded as 'pests' which have a severe negative economic impact on livestock and the wild game industry. If this threatened species is to be saved this perception must be reversed. The survival of the Namibian Cheetah is in the hands of approximately 1000 commercial farmers and their willingness to integrate Cheetah conservation efforts into farm management. ",

The current situation can be attributed over-utilization of the land and to ecological changes that have occurred as a result. In the early part of the century water holes were developed which resulted in more wildlife being attracted to the farmlands. Many wild animals were then killed because they were competing with livestock for water and food. In the 1960s severe drought, overgrazing and the reduction of large herds of migratory game changed the vegetation in the area. As farmland developed, farmers came into conflict with large predators and because of the extensive size of farms protective management of livestock was seldom employed. After the 1960s the Cheetah population began to increase probably because there were fewer predators and more water which attracted wildlife.",

In many areas 60-90% of the open grassland became heavy bush. To compensate for the loss of grazing land farmers resorted to catching migratory game to protect their pastures for domestic stock and between 1981 and 1983 the game populations in Namibia declined by 50% (Joubert, 1985) . During this time a rabies virus reduced the Kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros population by nearly 8OYo (Hassel, 1984) , which further reduced the potential food availability for Cheetahs.",

Namibian farmers have named these trees 'newspaper trees' because of their importance to the social interactions of Cheetahs. Although three types of tree have been used as playtrees, Cheetahs usually use large camel-thorn trees Acacia luederitzii. Some farms do not have playtrees (pass-through farms), so the Cheetahs move quickly on to the next playtree, while others have several and some have only one. The farmers set 2 m long wire cage traps, with drop doors at each end and a trigger in the middle, at these trees. A thorn bush boma (enclosure) makes the cage the only passage to the tree and any Cheetah entering the trap triggers the doors. Once caught, the animal's vocalizations attract other Cheetahs which are also caught.",

Increased importations of wildcaught Cheetahs from South Africa and housing the animals away from other large carnivores appeared to increase reproduction in captivity. The Cheetah population in North America peaked in the late 1970s but began to decrease in the early 1980s (Marker & O'Brien, 1989) and this decrease in reproduction caused much concern. At about this time it was documented that captive Cheetahs were depauperate of genetic variation (O'Brien et al., 1983 (O'Brien et al., , 1986 which could make them more susceptible to disease. In the early 1980s an outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) at Wildlife Safari, Winston, caused another major concern to managers and veterinarians (Evermann et al., 1984 (Evermann et al., , 1989 .In 1983 the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA; then AAZPA) approved the development of the North American Cheetah Species Sur-",

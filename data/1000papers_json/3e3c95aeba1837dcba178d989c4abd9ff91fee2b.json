After the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in South Korea on January 20, 2020, the Korea Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (KCDC) screened and evaluated persons who had a history of contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases, and screened the immigrants from countries where COVID-19 had spread. As of June 30, 2020, a total of 13,812 laboratory-confirmed cases has been documented and, recently, about 50 new cases have been confirmed daily. In several countries, a massive increase in the number of cases has resulted in high mortality due to the collapse of the health care system. In Korea, though several confirmed cases occurred simultaneously in late February, mortality was significantly lower than that in other countries due to active administration and treatment by both temporary care facilities and over 100 medical institutions. The COVID-19 strategy in South Korea, known as \"K-Quarantine,\" has conducted extensive contact tracing through testing positive case contacts and epidemiological surveys of confirmed cases, to identify and quarantine infected patients. Through this we could get information on clinical characteristics of the full spectrum of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases.",

Patients aged below 65 and without severe underlying diseases were isolated in care facilities. It was reported their body temperature and any other symptom change during their stay and health care professionals monitored their general condition. If their symptom indicated something clinically meaningful, they were transferred to the hospital. We collected information of 3301 cases about their demographics and underlying diseases at the time of admission; furthermore, among these cases we gathered information about major symptoms of 1737 patients.",

Clinical severity during analysis was classified as asymptomatic, or mild in the case of clinical severity 1 or 2; clinical severity of 3 or 4 was classified as severe; and cases with clinical severity 5 or higher requiring a ventilator was classified as critically ill [3] .

This is consistent with previous reports [11] . Behavioral difference such as smoking or alcohol intake, and high prevalence of pre-existing chronic diseases, may increase the risk of developing into severe illness. Another possible reason is that women have a stronger innate and adaptive immune response than men due to the X chromosome containing a high density of immune-related genes [12] . The sex difference of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors can be another possible reason for less severe diseases in women [13] . Further research is warranted for a better understanding of biological differences in disease severity.

This suggests that patients with such diseases were more likely to deteriorate into severe illness than those without underlying diseases. This implies that personal protection should be made available to patients and medical staff, especially to the elderly.",

Of the 30 0 0 patients admitted to the care facility, only 7 cases developed into the severe form, including one fatal case. Most of the confirmed patients were released from quarantine after a mild condition. Korea's initial strategy using temporary care facilities is considered to have greatly contributed to the successful handling of the COVID-19 pandemic without disrupting the health care system. Prognostic factors and other factors like age, fever, SOB/dyspnea, with or without underlying disease at the time of COVID-19 confirmation can be useful in predicting the prognosis of the confirmed patients as significant factors in predicting the severity. Therefore, the risk prediction model based on these prognostic factors is thought to be of great help in identifying the triage of the confirmers in the event of a large-scale outbreak in the future.",

The high rate of asymptomatic cases is believed to be a major factor in the continuous spread of COVID-19 causing difficulties in the control of the epidemic.",

Third, we did not include the effect of antiviral drugs or hydroxychloroquine on the risk assessment of clinical severity.

The clinical studies in such circumstances can be misleading indicators of the epidemic's trajectory. In Korea, because of active contact tracing, asymptomatic infected patients were found, and by including them in the analysis, the clinical severity among the actual infected people could be suggested. In addition, our study is different from other studies in that the observation results from some subjects who were asymptomatic at the time of confirmation until they were released were included.

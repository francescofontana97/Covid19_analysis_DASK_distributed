For example, Ridgway et al [24] found that a hospital's sickness absence policy prohibited febrile HCWs from working, but not those with respiratory symptoms. Another reason cited for presenteeism is related to individual factors, such as personal financial consequences. Employees felt they were not unwell enough to miss work, not thinking they could be vectors for transmission, and unsure of what constitutes \"too sick to work\" (the case for those who were asymptomatic or with very mild symptoms) [15, 24] .

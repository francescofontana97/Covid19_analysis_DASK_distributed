In this cohort, we piloted an alternative testing model to provide access to low-barrier, high-touch testing and augment studentdriven testing with data-driven adaptive surveillance that targets higher-risk students and triggers testing notifications based on reported symptoms, exposures, or other relevant information. A total of 2,180 students enrolled in the study, 51% of them undergraduates. Overall, 6,247 PCR tests were administered to 2,178 students over the two-month period. Overall test positivity rate was 0.9%; 2.6% of students tested positive. Uptake and acceptability of regular symptom and exposure surveys was high; 98% of students completed at least one survey, and average completion rate was 67% (Median: 74%, IQR: 39%) for daily reporting of symptoms and 68% (Median: 75%, IQR: 40%) for weekly reporting of exposures. Of symptom-triggered tests, 5% were PCR-positive; of exposure-triggered tests, 10% were PCR-positive. The integrated study database augmented traditional contact tracing during an outbreak; 17 potentially exposed students were contacted the following day and sent testing notifications.

Testing strategies for symptomatic or exposed students often rely on traditional student health service delivery approaches, which require phone-call based screening and appointment scheduling. Traditional contact tracing on university and college campuses in the United States similarly remains largely reliant on phone calls or in-person interviews and requires sufficient trust to elicit contact information. Among a student population that relies heavily on text-driven communication and may fear judgement or disciplinary reprisal for reporting risky behaviors, such approaches may introduce barriers to rapid detection and isolation of infected individuals.",

Because all test results were linked back to the Safe Campus database, rapid augmented contact notification for students with PCR results positive for SARS-CoV-2 was facilitated. For example, device-based testing notifications, including quarantine guidelines, could be sent immediately to all students sharing a residence with a newly identified case, a particularly important capability in a campus setting where 73% of undergraduate students live in non-university affiliated housing, which is often high density. Further, in the context of an emerging outbreak, likely contact notifications could be expanded to include students reporting shared risk factors (such as Greek affiliation) or behaviors (such as attendance at large social events). This system avoided delays in contact identification and notification that often occur with traditional contact tracing (serial interviews and phone calls), and aimed to strengthen student engagement by providing two way communication, giving students the ability to text, email, or call to immediately reach study staff who could provide instructions for accessing testing and quarantine information.",

In addition to survey data integral to the implementation of the Safe Campus system (including daily symptom and weekly exposure questionnaires), we collected endline survey data, including free text responses, on student perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors related to outbreak control. Survey data were collected and stored in an integrated REDCap [17, 18] data system. Nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing were collected by UHS staff at outdoor tents on campus; UHS also led all contact tracing and clinical management of PCR+ cases identified during the study. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on campus by the Innovative Genomics Institute [19] , enabling turnaround times generally <48 hours during a period when there were substantial delays regionally. In addition to PCR tests triggered by the Safe Campus system, additional comprehensive PCR testing was conducted at study baseline and endline for research purposes. This study was approved by the University of California, Berkeley Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (protocol #2020-05-13261), all study participants were required to provide written, informed consent.",

While greater coverage of the student population would be expected to contribute further to outbreak control, it is likely that the students who chose to enroll in the study were also those more positively engaged with COVID-19 outbreak control efforts. Second, the data system only captured results of PCR tests from UHS testing; however, we believe testing outside the free low barrier option offered through the study was uncommon. Third, the type of incentives used in this study may not be feasible at scale; however, there are other non-monetary nudges that could motivate participation in regular symptom or exposure surveys, such as leveraging social norms or commitments [14, 15] . The Safe Campus system described here could be improved in future iterations. First, additional data sources, potentially including wastewater-based monitoring [20, 21] and app-based mobility and contact data, could be integrated to improve risk assessment. Second, the Safe Campus database could be linked to de-identified regional health department data to further improve reach and more directly inform regional public health initiatives. Third, in settings and periods with higher test positivity rates, online machine learning algorithms could be used to provide time-updated risk stratification for test targeting [22] . Finally, effective testing strategies will contribute to outbreak containment only if coupled with rapid and effective isolation for persons with PCR results positive for SARS-CoV-2. Recent experiences on university campuses illustrate the additional challenges posed by this step in the COVID-19 infection control cascade [23] .",

Critically, this testing environment should be implemented alongside a data system that integrates multiple data sources to effectively trigger testing notifications to those at higher risk of infection and encourages students to come in for low-barrier testing when needed. In our experience, providing on-demand, no stigma testing, coupled with easy-access communication via text and email bolsters students' confidence that the campus is doing everything they can to keep students safe, and importantly, empowers them to contribute significantly to a safer campus during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

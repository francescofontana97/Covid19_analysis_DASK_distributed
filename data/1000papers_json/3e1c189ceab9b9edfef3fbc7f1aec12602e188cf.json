This must be itemized in the discussion section of the manuscript as a limitation. The ideological presupposition of using a 24hr-DR is quite inaccurate making it tedious to grasp the authors' conceptualization of this study. Using 24h-DR to define child feeding practices is inappropriate. This expression appears to have misrepresented the title and findings of the study. It is more appropriate to assert that the 24h-DR was used to determine child dietary diversity as against feeding practices. I am suggesting the authors consider revising the title and the entire manuscript to accurate reflection the true methods and results. Response: Child feeding practices were assessed using the standard WHO indicators (WHO, 2008), on the basis of the maternal recall of all foods and liquids given to children in the 24 h prior to the survey.

Agreeably, it is tedious to find pandemic-related studies in HFI to discuss their findings.

(c) whether the increase in the level of HFI (as a result of the measures promoted to manage the pandemic) affected child growth was not assessed in this study. This likely to lend credence to evidence for how HFI affects growth. This limitation is worth mentioning for future recommendations.

Dt are very relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because it was collected between December 2019 (in-person) and August 2020 (by phone). During this time HFI increased sharply from 21% to 80% before and during COVID-19 and difficult coping strategies needed to be implemented by families to deal with it. Analytical strategy to model changes in food insecurity status over time is appropriate. Manuscript is well written and has findings with key policy implications but needs to be improved taking the following recommendations into account.Response: Thank you for the reviewer's comments on the strength of the paper.1. Authors need to update their literature review to acknowledge and compare their findings to similar studies previously published.

Manuscript has been much improved and it is now clear what its innovative contributions are, and how it relates to other studies addressing household food insecurity in the context of COVID-19 in other parts of the world.Response: Thank you very much for your positive comments about our revised manuscript.Reviewer: 2 Dr. Akinkunmi Paul Okekunle, University of Ibadan Comments to the Author: Nguyen et al have revised their manuscript but there are concerns yet to be addressed.1. The quoted line numbers in the response to the reviewer file cannot to reconciled with the manuscript file. Also, at some point in the manuscript, there were no line numbers. This made is significantly tedious to follow the revisions thematically and tie the efforts of authors with the outcome of the revision.Response: We used the continuous line numbers that correspond to double spacing of the manuscript. When submitted, the website automatically generates other line numbers for the single space, and for each page separately-which cause the confusion. We plan to provide this feedback to editors-to they can improve the submission site in the future.2. Line 46 should be revised. COVID-19 cannot be reported to pose a risk to HFI. Rather the pandemic and lockdown measures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat to HFI. The same for the conclusion section of the manuscript. Response: We have revised the conclusion of abstract (line 47) and the paper (line 367) as suggested.3. Line 133-136: A supplementary table indicating food items from the 24hour DR that was used to derive the 7 groups may be necessary. Response: We have now provided a supplementary table (Supplemental Table 1 , line 134) indicating food items that was used to derive the 7 groups.4. There are limitations worth mentioning to assist readers of this study. The authors should consider a paragraph at the end of the discussion to itemize these limitations. Just to mention a few; (a) a single point 24-hour dietary recall for food/diet assessment may be unrepresentative of overall dietary exposure (b) residual confounding or unmeasured factors are potential factors to consider in examining our results. (c) whether the increase in the level of HFI (as a result of the measures promoted to manage the pandemic) affected child growth was not assessed in this study. This likely to lend credence to evidence for how HFI affects growth. This limitation is worth mentioning for future recommendations. (d) most coping measures for managing HFI in the study are related to managing expenditure. The HFI is likely to be more related to the threat to economic and earning power of household (as a result of measures imposed to manage the COVID-19 pandemic) than to the pandemic.(e) sequel to above, are there recommendations the author may suggest to guide threat against HFI in future pandemics. Going by the findings of this study. In a bid to prevent a pandemic, is it likely that another pandemic (food insecurity) is being created?Response: We have added the limitations of the study in lines 359-364 and also provided recommendations in lines 375-378.",

An excessive host inflammatory response in a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might contribute to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. Timely therapeutic intervention with immuno modulation in patients with hyperinflammation could prevent disease progression to ARDS and obviate the need for invasive ventilation. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an immunoregulatory cytokine with a pivotal role in initiation and perpetuation of inflammatory diseases. GM-CSF could link T-cell-driven acute pulmonary inflammation with an autocrine, self-amplifying cytokine loop leading to monocyte and macrophage activation. This axis has been targeted in cytokine storm syndromes and chronic inflammatory disorders. Here, we consider the scientific rationale for therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF in COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation. Since GM-CSF also has a key role in homoeostasis and host defence, we discuss potential risks associated with inhibition of GM-CSF in the context of viral infection and the challenges of doing clinical trials in this setting, highlighting in particular the need for a patient risk-stratification algorithm.",

The terminology related to these disorders is \u2022 Immunomodulation during a window of opportunity in a subgroup of patients with hyperinflammation might reduce progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), obviate the need for intubation, and reduce the high mortality in patients with COVID-19 \u2022 Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which signals via the JAK-STAT pathway and induces the production of interleukin-6 and other proinflammatory cytokines, could serve as a link between T-cell-driven acute pulmonary inflammation and an autocrine, self-amplifying cytokine loop leading to monocyte and macrophage activation \u2022 GM-CSF has been pursued as a therapeutic target in trials of chronic inflammatory disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) and cytokine storm syndromes (eg, cytokine release syndrome associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy) \u2022 Emerging evidence supports targeting of GM-CSF in patients with hyperinflammation and ARDS, including those with COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation; blockade of GM-CSF or its receptor using monoclonal antibodies is currently being pursued in COVID-19 clinical trials \u2022 Potential benefits of targeting GM-CSF in the context of virally driven hyperinflammation need to be carefully balanced against potential risks associated with blocking the role of GM-CSF in tissue homoeostasis and in antiviral immunity and host defence \u2022 Cross-specialty collaboration and randomised controlled trials will be essential to establish the potential benefits and risks of targeting GM-CSF in subgroups of patients with COVID-19 and the optimum timing of treatment hetero geneous; however, they are referred to collectively as cytokine storm syndromes, which are treated with immuno modulatory agents to attenuate the excessive immunoinflammatory response. The hyperinflammatory condition haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is characterised by a fulminant and fatal hyper cyto kinaemia with multiorgan failure, usually manifesting with cytopenia and abnormal liver function. When caused by genetic abnormalities, this disorder is referred to as primary or familial HLH. Secondary HLH is a hyperinflam matory syndrome triggered by infection, rheumatic disorders, and malignant disease (usually lympho proliferative disorders). Cytokine storm syndromes can be termed macrophage activation syn drome (when associated with rheumatic disease), macro phage activation-like syndrome (in sepsis), and cytokine release syndrome (after chimeric antigen receptor [CAR] T-cell therapy). 3 A subset of patients with severe COVID-19 shows evidence of hyperinflammation and might, therefore, potentially benefit from immuno modulation. ARDS is a heterogeneous clinical disorder characterised by refractory hypoxaemia, with mortality of 35-55% despite supportive standard of care, including low tidal volume ventilation. ARDS is defined by the development or worsening of hypoxaemia in the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and develops most commonly in response to community-acquired pneumonia. Cohort data from Wuhan, China, 12 show that ARDS occurs in approximately 30% of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and is associated with high mortality. Clinical trials of pharmacological agents in ARDS have been met with limited treatment successes, but unbiased latent class analysis of clinical and biomarker characteristics from randomised trial data has identified two distinct ARDS subphenotypes-a hypoinflammatory endotype and a hyperinflammatory endotype-with distinct clinical characteristics, biomarker profiles, clinical outcomes, and treatment responses. 13 Therefore, it is increasingly recognised that a tailored therapeutic approach to individual ARDS patients will be needed to improve clinical outcomes.",

            "text": "The clinical presentation of severe COVID-19 seems to be unique and has been the subject of much discussion in the community. Emerging experience suggests that the hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19 does not fit the classic profile of secondary HLH or cytokine release syndrome. Although ferritin levels predict mortality in COVID-19, 2 ranges are lower than those reported in patients with secondary HLH, and the clinical syndrome is lung dominant, typically without substantial cytopenia. Of note, lympho penia is almost universal in patients with severe COVID-19, 14 but the lymphocyte lineage is not classically affected in secondary HLH; in the context of COVID-19, therefore, lymphopenia might be the outcome of a viral driver. Whether patients with COVID-19 pneumonia present an atypical form of ARDS has also been debated, 15 but it is increasingly felt that ARDS associated with COVID-19 might not be dissimilar to the phenotype associated with other viral drivers. A management approach for COVID-19-associated ARDS has been proposed and is continuously evolving as clinical experience accumulates. 16 The proinflammatory cytokine GM-CSF GM-CSF was originally defined as a haematopoietic growth factor because of its ability to form colonies of granulocytes and macrophages in vitro by promoting proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow progenitor cells. 17 Later, GM-CSF was found to act on mature myeloid cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, as a prosurvival or activating factor with a role in inflammation. Unlike other members of the colonystimulating factor superfamily of pleiotropic growth factors (eg, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulo cyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]), GM-CSF does not seem to have a role in steady-state myelopoiesis. 17 Instead, GM-CSF plays a key role in tissue inflammation, with mounting evidence that it contributes to develop ment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including T-helper (Th)17-driven diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis. 18",

            "text": "Targeting GM-CSF receptor alpha Viewpoint GM-CSF is expressed locally in tissues such as the lung, gut, and skin, but it is virtually undetectable in the systemic circulation. 19 Multiple cellular sources of GM-CSF have been described. In the healthy lung, GM-CSF is secreted by alveolar type II epithelial cells (figure 1) and has a key role in maturation and function of alveolar macrophages, including surfactant catabolism. Congenital or acquired GM-CSF deficiency can lead to pulmonary alveolar proteinosis because of dysregulated surfactant clearance. 18 GM-CSF has an important host-defence function in maintenance of the integrity of the alveolar capillary barrier; 20,21 moreover, it has an immuno stimulatory protective role in pathogenic clearance in the context of bacterial and virally triggered pneumonia or ARDS. [22] [23] [24] Growing evidence suggests that GM-CSF is produced and acts locally at sites of tissue inflammation. 18 T cells seem to be the most prominent producers of GM-CSF in tissue inflammation, but epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, stromal cells, and haematopoietic cells can also all produce GM-CSF, commensurate with a role for this cytokine in integrating tissue-regulated inflammatory cell infiltration, even before T-cell migration. Local production of GM-CSF increases with inflammation, 18 and the level of this cytokine is increased in synovial fluid and serum from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with multiple sclerosis, 18 and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with ARDS. 25 GM-CSF is pivotal to proinflammatory cytokine networks, 17 including the cytokine cascade in HLH, 26 and it not only induces expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, and IL-23, but also promotes differentiation of Th1 or Th17 cells and polarisation of macrophages to an M1-like phenotype. 18",

In severe inflammatory states, GM-CSF production is upregulated by alveolar type II epithelial cells and monocyte-derived M1-like macrophages, thereby stimulating IL-6 production from CD14 + and CD16 + inflammatory monocytes, increasing Th1 and Th17 T cells and driving the recruitment and priming of neutrophils. The resulting autocrine, positive feedback loop of GM-CSF production further perpetuates the inflammatory milieu. GM-CSF=granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. IL=interleukin. SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Th=T helper. Emerging evidence suggests a role for GM-CSF in HLH, based on admin istration of recombinant G-CSF in patients with this disorder. In clinical practice, there are concerns that administration of G-CSF might worsen HLH; indeed, the observation that administration of recombinant G-CSF (eg, lenograstim) exacerbated syno vitis supported the rationale to target the GM-CSF pathway in rheumatoid arthritis. 29 To the best of our knowledge, five cases have been reported of exacerbation of existing or de-novo provocation of HLH after admin istration of recombinant G-CSF or GM-CSF (appendix pp 1-2). [30] [31] [32] [33] This experience warrants cautious use of recombinant G-CSF in critically ill patients with neutro penia and evidence of HLH.",

            "text": "Further evidence of a role for GM-CSF in HLH comes from murine models of both the primary and secondary disorder, in which GM-CSF has been shown to be elevated in untreated, active disease and significantly reduced with treatment aimed at JAK inhibition. 34 Moreover, a HLHlike disease was observed in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-infected IFN\u03b3 and Prf1 double knockout mice, with a cytokine milieu dominated by IL-6 and GM-CSF, similar to human HLH, challenging the dogma that IFN\u03b3 is mandatory for pathogenesis of HLH. 35 A humanised mouse model of post-allogeneic stem-cell transplant HLH showed increased GM-CSF levels, in parallel with other cytokines expected to be increased in patients with this hyperinflammatory disorder, including IL-6, TNF, IFN\u03b3, and IL-18. 36 Experimental evidence for neutrophil-mediated tissue injury in the pathobiology of HLH is also emerging. Splenic neutrophils from a mouse model of HLH upregulated the TREM1 protein and increased production of intracellular TNF, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1 (CCL3), MIP-1\u03b2 (CCL4), and IL-1\u03b2. This phenotype was ameliorated with JAK1 and JAK2 inhibition (using ruxolitinib), but not IFN\u03b3 inhibition. Poorer survival of mice treated with IFN\u03b3 inhibition (compared with ruxolitinib) was rescued by the addition of neutrophildepleting antibodies, but not anti-IL-6 or anti-TNF antibodies. 34, 37 These data support a role for neutro phil activation in the pathobiology of HLH and highlight possible similarities between HLH-mediated organ injury and severe organ injury seen in other critical illnesses, such as sepsis and ARDS. 38, 39 Targeting GM-CSF in ARDS The scientific rationale for targeting GM-CSF in patients with ARDS is gaining strength. The initial injury response or exudative phase of ARDS is characterised by release of potent proinflammatory mediators, including GM-CSF, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (CCL2), IL-1\u03b1, IL-8, and TNF secreted by resident alveolar macrophages, leading to recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes. Neutrophils have been strongly implicated in the development of ARDS 40 by acting as primary effector cells of bystander tissue injury through release of proteinases, reactive oxygen species, and neutrophil extracellular traps; recent reports have also highlighted the role of neutrophil extracellular traps in COVID-19. 41, 42 Moreover, the extent, duration, and priming status of neutrophils in alveolar airspaces are strong predictors of outcome in ARDS. 25 Alveolar GM-CSF contributes to acute and persistent neutrophilic inflammation by affecting neutrophil function, including promoting upregulation of the IgA Fc receptor, formyl peptide receptor (FPR1), CD11b, and expression of the leukotriene B4 receptor; chemotaxis, phagocytosis, release of leukotriene B4 and arachidonic acid, NADPH oxidase 2 (CYBB)-mediated superoxide anion generation; and by exerting a pronounced prosurvival effect mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis. 25, [43] [44] [45] [46] Recent study findings suggest that GM-CSF receptor alpha blockade can inhibit inflammation in response to inhaled lipopolysaccharide in a mouse model of acute lung injury. 47",

            "text": "Indirect evidence for a role for anti-GM-CSF therapeutic targeting in COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation comes from cytokine release syndrome following CAR T-cell therapy. The immunomodulatory agent tocilizumab (anti-IL-6-receptor monoclonal anti body) is licensed for treatment of cytokine release syndrome, a disorder that might be associated with neurotoxicity. Cytokine release syndrome is directly related to in-vivo T-cell expansion and striking production of the T-cell effector cytokines IL-6, TNF, CCL2, and GM-CSF. Current evidence suggests that serum levels of GM-CSF, ferritin, and IL-2 are associated with neurotoxicity. 49 Amounts of GM-CSF are raised in serum and cerebrospinal fluid in children with COVID-19 and CNS manifestations. 50 A proof-of-concept study using a neutralising anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody (lenzilumab) in a xenograft model prevented cytokine release syndrome and enhanced the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy. 51 Based on these findings, a phase 2 trial com bin ing lenzilumab in the setting of CAR T-cell therapy is planned. Next-generation CAR T cells in which GM-CSF has been knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing are being developed to minimise the risk of cytokine release syndrome. 52 In view of the central role of GM-CSF in several chronic inflammatory disorders, considerable interest has been shown in targeting this cytokine in hyperinflammatory disease contexts. Inhibition of GM-CSF or its receptor is currently being investigated in randomised trials in rheumatoid arthritis, 18 including a 24-week phase 3 headto-head comparison trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (NCT04134728) aimed at inhibiting GM-CSF (otilimab), IL-6 (sarilumab), and the JAK-STAT pathway (tofacitinib). To the best of our knowledge, no overt safety concerns have been identified and there have been no cases reported of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in the clinical development programmes of any agent targeting GM-CSF or its receptor to date. In the setting of severe COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation, a short duration of treatment with an anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody might be sufficient to switch off hyperinflammation while mitigating potential on-target safety concerns that could be associated with long-term GM-CSF blockade. It is also worth highlighting that GM-CSF induces the production of IL-6 and signals via the JAK-STAT pathway. 53 Clinical trials of JAK inhibitors are ongoing in patients with COVID-19 (eg, NCT04362137), and the IL-6 pathway is currently the focus of several clinical trials in COVID-19 (eg, NCT04320615). Interest in the IL-6 axis was probably fuelled by purported similarities (eg, increased C-reactive protein) between COVID-19associated hyperinflammation and cytokine release syndrome associated with CAR T-cell therapy. Moreover, other agents used in secondary HLH (eg, IL-1 inhibition with anakinra) 54 are also currently being investigated in patients with COVID-19. Targeting GM-CSF could offer advantages over selective IL-6 blockade, because inhibition of GM-CSF might affect both hyperinflammation and ARDS, and might be less myelosuppressive and hepatotoxic than IL-6 blockade. JAK inhibitors are licensed for chronic inflammatory conditions (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) and myeloprolifer ative neoplasms and are being actively investigated in hyperinflammation. 55, 56 However, the potential deleterious effects associated with inhibition of multiple cytokines simultaneously, compared with single-cytokine blockade, and potential increased risk of thrombosis requires careful consideration. This consideration is especially pertinent in the setting of COVID-19, in view of accumulating evidence of coagulopathy and autopsy findings of pulmonary microthrombi. 57",

Rather than blocking GM-CSF, there is an opposing view that treatment with GM-CSF could have therapeutic potential in ARDS. In a proof-of-concept study, the beneficial effect of inhaled GM-CSF was shown in six patients with pneumonia-associated ARDS, 58 and a clinical trial is underway of administration of inhaled and intravenous recombinant GM-CSF (sargramostim) in patients with COVID-19 (NCT04326920). Evidence suggests that increased concentrations of GM-CSF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with ARDS positively correlated with survival; 25 by contrast, a subsequent randomised trial of therapeutic admin istration of recombinant GM-CSF in ARDS (n=130) did not improve clinical outcomes. 59 In that study, administration of intravenous GM-CSF daily for 14 days was not associated with adverse clinical outcomes or increased concentrations of systemically measured cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, TNF, or GM-CSF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (measured in selected participants). 59 These observations, together with studies showing that exogenous administration of GM-CSF does not exacer bate sepsis, 60 could provide a counter-argument for the approach of targeting GM-CSF in ARDS. First, as acknowledged by Paine and colleagues, 59 their study included a smaller than anticipated number of patients treated (the study Viewpoint was originally designed with an enrolment target of 200, but recruitment proved slower than anticipated and the trial was closed after 132 participants had been enrolled) and the timing of treatment initiation might not have been ideal (ie, during the recovery phase of ARDS). Moreover, interventional studies with a GM-CSF antibody in COVID-19 are aimed at attenuating the immune dysregulation of hyper inflammation before it leads to the development of ARDS; once ARDS is established, it could indeed be too late for this intervention to provide substantial clinical benefit.",

Lympho penia is an established risk factor for secondary bacterial infections and might predict fatality and worse outcomes in COVID-19. 2 In a cohort study of 54 nonsurvivors with confirmed COVID-19, approximately 50% had secondary bacterial infections. 12 Acquired impairment of neutrophil phagocytosis in critical illness predicts nosocomial infections and is reversed by GM-CSF ex vivo. However, administration of GM-CSF (sargramostim) in a randomised trial in this setting did not improve neutrophil phagocytosis. 63 There is also a theoretical possibility that immunomodulation in COVID-19 could represent a temporary reprieve and enable viral resurg ence from a circulating reservoir of non-cleared virus. Strategies using antimicrobial prophyl axis (eg, with anti biotics or antiviral drugs) could be insufficient to mitigate the risk and could promote the development of resistant organisms. Additionally, it might be inappro priate to extrapo late experience (efficacy or safety profiles) of immuno modulation in hyper inflammation secondary to a drug-related trigger (eg, cytokine release syndrome after CAR T-cell therapy) or immunomodulation in chronic inflammatory disorders (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) to a viral setting, because a resident pool of virus could serve as a continuous stimulus for cytokinaemia, and immunomodulation might potentially affect viral clearance mechanisms. A deeper understanding of early pathophysiological events in viral (including COVID-19) or bacterial ARDS, or ARDS of other causes, will be imperative in our quest to develop novel therapeutic approaches and the role of anti-GM-CSF agents in these settings.",

However, since COVID-19 is a new disease entity, it presents several urgent challenges around clinical trial design, selection of patients, and stratification. Early intervention before the onset of respiratory failure will probably prevent poor outcomes. 64 Once patients need ventilatory support, the purported window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention might already have been missed, and patients might tip into an accelerated state, during which time initiation of treatment could be less effective or even futile 54 (figure 2). The ideal window of opportunity for immunomodulation might be before patients develop severe disease 64, 65 and need invasive mechanical ventilation (intubation). However, robust predictive biomarkers for poor outcomes and in-depth characterisation of the host immune response across disease stages, to minimise the effect of immunomodulatory agents on the antiviral response, are urgently needed. Moreover, non-intubated patients would present a lower risk in terms of opportunistic or nosocomial infections, compared with intubated patients, who could have several artificial indwelling catheters (eg, endotracheal tubes, vascular access lines, or urinary catheters) that could act as a nidus for infection.",

Identification of patients with COVID-19 using stratification variables is, however, very challenging without robust predictive biomarkers to identify those with poor prognosis who are likely to progress. It is important to maintain a measured clinical and scientific equipoise in the face of a rapidly evolving global pandemic. The bioethical stance of nonmaleficence needs to be balanced against the risk of withholding potentially life-saving immunomodulatory treatment in a population with high mortality and few treatment options. Identification of new therapeutic approaches beyond existing licensed immunomodulatory agents would address potential issues about drug shortages for COVID-19 clinical trials, and for patients who are dependent on these drugs to control chronic conditions. Ongoing and future clinical trials will provide much needed evidence for safety and efficacy of immunomodulatory agents in this setting, and their results are eagerly awaited.",

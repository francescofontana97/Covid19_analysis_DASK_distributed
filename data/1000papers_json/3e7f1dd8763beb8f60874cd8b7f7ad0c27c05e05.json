TM has become increasingly popular over the last years due to its immense 105 potential to positively impact a wide range of populations and address major barriers in 106 access to care (2-4). The non face-to-face (Nf2f) models can be categorised as either 107 synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous interactions occur in 'real time' between the 108 patient and the healthcare provider, and consist of a pre-booked audio-only (telephone) or 2-109 way video session. In the asynchronous Nf2f care model, the patient and the provider are not 110 online at the same time. The two types of asynchronous care include 'store & forward' 111 applications, and remote patient monitoring (2). 112 Although the use of TM in allergy is not new (5-7), it was only after the outbreak of 113 the COVID-19 pandemic and following the advice from Public Health England and the UK 114 government to 'stay at home' and avoid nonessential travel that the adult allergy services 115 across the UK transitioned to a Nf2f model almost overnight to reduce or replace face-to-116 face (f2f) visits. 117 We report on the outcomes of the use of synchronous TM for outpatient allergy 118 consultations in a tertiary adult allergy centre. This is the first study with a completely 119 unselected patient cohort. Due to the pandemic and the unexpected switch from in-person 120 visits to Nf2f clinics, the patients had not been offered the choice to have a f2f or a Nf2f 121 appointment. The referral letters had not been previously reviewed to decide if a remote 122 consultation was appropriate. Moreover, based on our experience, we propose a new model 123 of care which integrates TM into a drug allergy service.",

For most of the patients (45%), an in-197 person visit was going to be arranged in our Department after the easing of the pandemic-198 related restrictions. In 10.7% of patients, the referring clinicians were advised to perform the 199 relevant diagnostic tests. A small number of patients (1%) was advised to contact our 200 Department to arrange further testing in a few months. A recommendation to re-refer to the 201 Department for a f2f assessment and testing after the pandemic was made to the referring 202 clinician in 1% of the patients. The patients requiring allergy testing were predominantly 203 under investigation for suspected food allergy (72%), and rhinitis (19%). 204 Following a Nf2f consultation more than 42% of the new patients were discharged 205 without requiring further allergy investigations or input. Therefore, no further f2f visit was 206 arranged. These patients had been mainly referred for urticaria/angioedema (49.4%), food-207 related reactions (21%) and rhinitis (16.6%). Routine laboratory testing (e.g. full blood 208 count, thyroid function, etc) was recommended to the referring physician in 15% of the 209 discharged patients, mostly of them with urticaria/angioedema (88%). Five of the discharged 210 patients (1.3%) were referred to dermatology, mainly for suspected allergic contact 211 dermatitis, and 2 patients (0.5%) to ear, nose and throat for further assessment of their 212 rhinitis. Twenty of the newly referred patients (5.2%) would require a follow-up 213 appointment in our Department; nearly half of them had been referred for 214 urticaria/angioedema. 215 A total of 56 patients had a telephone follow-up consultation. Urticaria/angioedema 216 appears to be the most common diagnosis for follow-up appointments (46.4%), followed by 217 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The advantages of TM for both the patient and the clinician are clear (2-4, 22). Its 356 integration into the drug allergy service can make it more time-and cost-effective. Following 357 a Nf2f assessment, only the clinically relevant drugs will be prepared for skin testing as 358 opposed to all drugs listed in the referral letter. If skin testing is not validated or available, a 359 drug provocation test can be easily arranged following the remote assessment.

All Nf2f appointments 130 were synchronous and conducted by telephone. The clinicians had full access to the 131 Electronic Patient Records (EPR, iSOFT Group Plc) and an electronic medical notes system 132 to document the consultation. The allocated duration of a Nf2f appointment was 20 minutes. 133 The clinical team included eight allergy consultants (specialists) and two specialty registrars 134 (residents in training). The referral letters had been previously vetted, and the patients were 135 deemed appropriate for a f2f allergy review. 136 We determined the number of new and follow-up appointments and the overall Did 137 Not Attend (DNA) rate. The patients who did not have a consultation were not included in 138 the analysis. We reviewed the reasons for the referral based on the information provided by 139 the referring clinician (all new appointments), and the working diagnosis from the previous 140 allergy review (follow-up appointments). Based on the reason for the referral, we divided the 141 Nf2f appointments into two groups: related to adverse drug reactions (ADR) and non-adverse 142 drug reactions (non-ADR). We then divided each into new and follow-up appointments. 143 We identified the Nf2f clinic outcomes, and the number of patients who required 144 further f2f allergy testing following their remote assessment. We identified how many 145 needed to return to our Department for testing and how many were advised to have the 146 diagnostic tests organised by the referring clinician. Finally, we determined how many 147 follow-up appointments were requested, and if a referral to a different specialty was required.",

Sixty-nine patients (71%) required further 234 f2f investigations (e.g. skin prick testing, intradermal testing, in vitro testing, drug 235 provocation test etc.). However, 29% of the patients referred with a suspected ADR did not 236 require further allergy input following their Nf2f review and were discharged (Fig. 1 ). The 237 one follow-up patient did not require further investigations either. Relevant models of care in allergy have been previously suggested (15). However, more than 310 half of these patients in our cohort required a further f2f visit for allergy testing, mostly for 311 suspected food allergy and rhinitis. Therefore, detailed screening criteria should be in place 312 to identify patients suitable for a remote assessment (Table II) . These criteria could be applied during the referral vetting process for Nf2f patient selection. The UK General 314 Medical Council (GMC) have also produced generic criteria to help determine whether a 315 remote consultation is appropriate (16).",

Crucially, less than 10% of Nf2f follow-up 320 patients required a further in-person visit for additional allergy testing in agreement with a 321 previous report (7).

The referring clinician will be prompted to use a standardised questionnaire (18) to 335 record the relevant information when referring a patient to a drug allergy service. The 336 questionnaire will be available on the digital platform the primary care physicians are using to refer patients to the allergy service. The referral will be then vetted by the clinicians, and 338 if it is deemed appropriate for drug allergy assessment, a Nf2f appointment will be booked.",

More than 42% of the new 283 patients, were discharged from the Allergy Service after a single Nf2f consultation. This 284 highlights the fact that a significant number of allergy consultations can be completed 285 without an in-person visit or allergy testing. During a Nf2f consultation the clinicians are 286 able to engage in a conversation similar to a f2f visit and obtain a comprehensive allergy 287 history. If required, patients can provide more information after the Nf2f appointment: images of the rash, previous laboratory results or discharge summaries from emergency 289 department visits, using a secure email address provided by the clinician. Patient information 290 leaflets and other educational materials could be easily provided via a validated web link in 291 the clinic letter which follows the Nf2f appointment; alternatively, these links could be 292 available on the Department's website. Nearly half of the discharged patients had been 293 referred for what proved to be spontaneous urticaria/angioedema, where the diagnosis is 294 based primarily on the clinical presentation, and allergy testing is not usually indicated, as per 295 the current guidelines from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology 296 (EAACI) (13) and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) 297 (14).

Therefore, Nf2f consultations could be a useful triaging tool for these cases as 349 well, since the process of obtaining additional information, such as copies of the medical 350 notes and drug charts, discharge summaries, laboratory or biopsy reports etc., is often a time-351 consuming administrative challenge.

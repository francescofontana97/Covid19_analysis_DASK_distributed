Starting from testing to treatment, various innovations have been implemented and experimented. For instance, the testing procedures for COVID-19 have been carried out in different phases from short time results with less accuracy to high accuracy testing in tradeoff with time. Generally, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 which is quite an accurate method as it detects the presence of viral RNA. Other techniques include serologic testing, antigen testing etc. (Verdict Medical devices, 2020). Testing a voluminous population is necessary to give a big picture of the infection status and thus, the demand for the testing kits is in peak. The technique adopted for testing might vary from place to place, for populous countries antibody tests can be effective for initial screening to know the immune nature of the population and to map the infection. Moreover, they can yield results in a short period and rapid antibody testing would consume around 15-30 min to give the results (India Today, 2020). Bosch developed an innovative quick test to produce the results in two and a half hours and claims that it is one of the world's completely automatic molecular diagnostic tests (Verdict Medical devices, 2020). AI and ML have been contributed in many ways which is discussed in upcoming sections. They changed the way of approach in interacting and handling the patients, provides insight in predicting the infection spreading rate, innovative approaches in diagnosing the disease and identify those who would develop serve symptoms, and whatnot. Another new approach by a group of researchers and engineers of San-Francisco called Cough for the Cure which uses trained model to identify COVID-19 with the audio samples of the patient's cough (Verdict Medical devices, 2020) .

The information must be updated as soon as verified by the authorities and at the same time, risk perception of the public should also be considered depending on the dose of the information. The challenge can be overcome by carefully addressing the information to the mass public in such a way that the information does not increase the panic among the people.

The government-public communication is typically an external communication and the information to be conveyed must be complete and accurate. The public must remain optimistic to cooperate with the government and perceive the importance of the information conveyed by the government.

Though a huge amount of data is available, most of them are never used for building mathematical models that can be integrated with health care system (Weintraub et al., 2018) and it is seen that only about 15% of the hospitals are currently using these technologies even then the usage accounts only for limited purposes (Zeng and Luo, 2017) . Thus, the research on these active topics would be beneficial (Rajkomar et al., 2019; Beam and Kohane, 2018) . In a pandemic situation, these technologies provide substantial support to the healthcare system. We can sort the role of these technologies in the health care system as prediction, diagnosis and treatment which will be discussed in the coming section and also other aspects of these technologies that helped in the pandemic situation is also presented.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 194, "text": "(Luo et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 195, "end": 213, "text": "Toga et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 214, "end": 239, "text": "Murdoch and Detsky, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 527, "end": 550, "text": "(Lundberg et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 551, "end": 570, "text": "Saria et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 571, "end": 592, "text": "Marella et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 650, "end": 668, "text": "(Kuo et al., 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 669, "end": 691, "text": "Rumsfeld et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 692, "end": 711, "text": "Liang et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 757, "end": 777, "text": "(Bates et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 778, "end": 804, "text": "\u00d6zdemir and Barshan, 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 805, "end": 829, "text": "Lo-Ciganic et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 983, "end": 1007, "text": "(Weintraub et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1174, "text": "(Zeng and Luo, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1262, "text": "(Rajkomar et al., 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1285, "text": "Beam and Kohane, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning"}, {"text": "The widely used application of AI and ML are forecasting and classification of data. It is reported that an AI-based start-up BlueDot uses an infection-surveillance system all around the clock which scans for more than 100,000 online articles across the globe in 65 languages for every 15 min. On 30 December 2019, the algorithm noted an unusual bump in 'pneumonia cases' with 'unknown reason' in Wuhan, China and it alerted the outbreak of disease much before it has officially identified as COVID 19 (Diginomica, 2020) . Thus, these eye-opening technologies can predict such epidemics and alert humanity to take the necessary advanced measures. Companies like BlueDot and Metabiota employs natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to perform analysis of health-care reports in different languages and their predictive tools can also be employed to trace the potential infection hubs from the air-travel data. For instance, public report of Metabiota listed the countries which include China, Italy, Iran and the US will likely to report new cases and the reality isn't differed much (MIT Technology Review, 2020a). A data-based analysis by Constantinos Siettos et al. forecasted the outbreak in Hubiei, China up to 29 February 2020, considering the data reported between 11 January and 10 February 2020. They forecasted that a minimum infection would be 45,000 and the death count will be around 2700. And the infected number was around 67,000 and the death count was in the 2800 s which is close (ITN, 2020a) . From these incidents, we can infer that AI and ML can be used for predicting the situation and based on which we can act accordingly to reduce the intensity of outbreaks. Data classification along with prediction is significant because it can give a clear idea of how to deal with the data. For example, during the outbreak, there is a demand for identifying the extent of infection cases from mild to critical illness. One such analysis was carried out by Xiangao Jiang et al. in which the AI framework was used to find the COVID outbreak and the patients at critical illness based on the data from two hospitals in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China . The predictive model developed was 70% to 80% accurate with the predicted critical cases.

In case of COVID-19, the infection mainly spreads through tiny droplets carried in air or any surface from the cough produced by the infected person. So as a preventive measure, masks and hand sanitizers are required in large amount to satisfy the need of the public. Also, to treat infected persons, hospitals need ventilators in a massive quantity. To meet such demands, several solutions have been carried out. Dyson Ltd., a British tech company has partnered with The Technology Partnership (TTP) designed a brand-new ventilator named CoVent and it meets the standards of the clinical specification (Techcrunch, 2020). It might be challenging for industries using complex technologies for manufacturing their products to adapt for producing ventilators but several automotive industries have successfully repurposed their factory to produce different products to strengthen the health care system. Brewers and distillers were restructured their production system to produce hand sanitizer and alcohol-based disinfectants and other suppliers purchases new injection molds for producing test kits (Autodesk-Redshift, 2020).

For severely affected area, the supplies can be provided by the workers with protective equipment. We propose a system that can be effectively followed by the people to support social distancing. Initially, the information of available markets in an area should be collectively gathered and uploaded in a website run by some private, public or government agencies. The people can access the website and choose the market and then can give a request for their need. The people will be allotted a slot with specific time range (like between 9 and 10 am) along with a token number corresponding to the slot. The shopkeeper will be in touch with the website request and act accordingly to pack the listed things. After verifying the token number and slot timings, the things can be handover to the buyer. By implementing this, one can run the market throughout the day and this will help the mobs to effectively follow the social distancing.

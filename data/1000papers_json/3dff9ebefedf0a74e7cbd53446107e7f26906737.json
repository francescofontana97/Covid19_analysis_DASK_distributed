During the same time period, total number of U.S. hospital admissions for a mental health (MH) crisis has increased by 12.2%, with rural counties demonstrating the largest suicide rate increases overall. Introduction: Increasing number of rural patients are reporting need for MH care in the region's four rural EDs. Characteristics of ED telemental health services were evaluated, including MH diagnostic category, voluntary vs. involuntary commitment (IC), forensic vs. nonforensic presentation, ED throughput, disposition, and payor reimbursement. Materials and Methods: Observational 2.5-year program evaluation of telemental health care delivery for children (n = 114) and adults (n = 417) who were evaluated by a rural ED physician and received an MH diagnosis. Participants (N = 531) were treated by a licensed psychiatrist through telemental care delivery from September 2017 to April 2020. Results: Noncommitted ED MH patients (86%; n = 455) were distributed across three major diagnostic groups:",

Fourteen percent (n = 76/531) of ED MH patients were subsequently IC, with 67% of those assessed as needing IP care. Forty-nine percent (n = 37) of IC patients presented in police custody. Most common diagnosis for IC patients was suicidal ideation/attempt (v 2 [2, N = 452] = 12.884, p = 0.002). Admitted patients experienced significantly longer length of stay than those with OP referral ( p = 0.001). Mean total payor reimbursements for ED MH care were significantly lower than actual ED costs ( p < 0.001). Discussion: Innovative approaches to telemental care for IC and non-IC patients need to be piloted and comparatively evaluated in rural CAHs. Conclusion: As the gateway to critically needed MH care, rural CAHs and public services pivotal to care access (e.g., law enforcement) need additional resources and support.",

            "text": "The number of emergency department (ED) visits for mental health (MH) care is on the rise across the United States, 1 with rates for all-cause ED visits to small rural ''safety net'' hospitals reported to have increased by 50% since 2005. 2 During this same time period, the total number of U.S. hospital admissions for an MH crisis increased by 12.2%, 3 the rate of suicide increased >20% in 87% of U.S. counties, and rural counties demonstrated the largest suicide rate increases overall. 4 In the midst of these challenges, *66% of U.S. rural and partially rural counties are designated as MH care professional shortage areas by the federal government. 5 Hospital or residential facilities with the inpatient (IP) psychiatric beds needed for emergent MH care are scarce in rural settings. 1, 6, 7 Twenty-six U.S. states have reported a shortage of IP psychiatric beds, and have growing waiting lists. 7 Since rural critical access hospital (CAH) EDs are typically the entry point for health care in rural communities when any type of health crisis occurs, 2,8 the current psychiatric provider shortage creates an emergent situation for rural generalist care providers who are not likely to be formally trained or licensed in psychiatric care. 1, 2, 8 The importance of telemental health in rural settings If a psychiatric consult with an MH specialist is not immediately available, rural MH patients may be sent home to wait for days, weeks, or even months for their initial evaluation by a psychiatric specialist. 1, [7] [8] [9] [10] The implementation of MH care delivered through telehealth, or telemental health, serves to provide effective and expedient access 6, 7 to psychiatric evaluation that is similar in efficacy to face-to-face care. [6] [7] [8] 11, 12 Telemental care delivery has been reported to level the playing field in rural settings, so that the major social determinants of health (ready access to care, geographic location, health insured status, and socioeconomic disparities) are addressed to foster more efficient and effective care. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Implementation of telehealth has also been shown to decrease rural patients' ED wait time and length of stay (LOS). 8, 9, 11, 13, 14 Current state regulations permit use of telehealth for MH services in 30 U.S. states, and for substance use disorder services in 21 U.S. states. 6(p.24) Law enforcement and MH care Law enforcement personnel are often called to assist families who are experiencing an MH crisis. 3, 6, 7 Members of law enforcement are viewed as contributing to the community safety net that provides support for emergent MH situations in which someone feels endangered. 1, 3, 6 As a result, police officers often bring adults or youth to hospital EDs who are judged to be a danger to self or others, and/or who are perceived as seriously deteriorating and not able to care for themselves. 3, 6 In many EDs across the United States (including the CAH EDs participating in this study), hospital administrators frequently hire off-duty law enforcement officers to provide a protective presence, and to help ED staff manage emergent MH crises. 3 Involuntary commitment and MH care In some U.S. states, there is a rising number of MH patients presenting to EDs who are assessed as being a danger to themselves or others, and who are subsequently involuntarily committed to IP psychiatric care, or to supervised outpatient (OP) care, (assisted/assertive outpatient treatment [AOT]). 6 Suicide-related diagnoses, including suicide attempt, suicidal ideation, and self-injury/self-harm behaviors, are a common reason underlying involuntary commitment (IC) across the United States. 6, 15, 16 Other major causes of the emergent need for IC are substance abuse (SA) related, including intentional poisoning and overdose, and serious mental illnesses, including psychotic episode. 6 In most states, the definition of ''being a danger to self or others'' is the primary reason for initiating IC proceedings in the ED or other clinical setting. 6, 7 IC, ED care, and state regulations There are processes for IC in every U.S. state, and the diagnosis of a mental illness is a required element for IC in all states. 6 The IC process typically requires a judge's signature on the IC order, and the judge's approval usually has to occur within 48-72 h of the attending provider's initial order. 6 Thus, judges have a pivotal role in the IC process, and can influence rates of IC in each county or region. 3, 6 For example, some judges may only agree to involuntarily commit a patient if an IP psychiatric bed is available, or if they believe in the utility of IC in general. 3, 6 States vary widely in their estimated annual rate of psychiatric commitment, ranging from 0.23 to 43.8 per 1000 persons with serious mental illness (Hawaii and Wisconsin, respectively). 17 The administrative burden on the receiving ED for managing and processing in-house and follow-up MH care for the IC patient is substantial. In the state of Indiana, the IC process is called either ''emergency detention'' (nonforensic presentation; Indiana Code P.L. 2-1992, SEC.20) 18 or immediate detention (forensic presentation; Indiana Code . 18 In both cases, if the patient needs to be held beyond 24 h, a county judge must sign the involuntary psychiatric commitment order within 72 h.",

Experts recommend that more research is needed in telemental health to explore any differences in temporal, disposition, and cost characteristics 13 based on different MH diagnoses. 8, 14, 21, 22 It is also important to highlight characteristics of MH ED patients in the context of both forensic (law enforcement) and civil or nonforensic IC cases. 3, 6 Characteristics surrounding forensic IC compared with nonforensic IC can potentially inform important MH care resource needs for rural CAHs and their communities. 3, 6 Purpose of the study The purpose of this study was to assess the state of telemental health care delivery for a group of rural CAH EDs in four West Central Indiana counties, in light of the context surrounding subsequent psychiatric IC or noninvoluntary commitment (non-IC) of MH patients who presented to the participating EDs. The primary variable characteristics assessed regarding ED telemental care delivery included age, gender, presentation (forensic or nonforensic), major diagnostic group, subsequent IC vs. non-IC status, disposition upon discharge (IP vs. OP), and temporal characteristics. The secondary variable characteristics evaluated were cost, primary payor, and payor reimbursement in relation to IC status, major diagnostic group, and disposition.",

Nearly half of study participants (49%) were assessed as needing IP care, including 14% who were assessed as needing psychiatric commitment, and 35% who were subsequently voluntarily admitted to IP psychiatric care. However, this study characteristics revealed a lower proportion of hospital admissions among patients with suicide risk compared with an evaluation of patients treated with telehealth in a group of rural CAHs in Iowa. 15 In the Iowa study, 15 rural ED patients who were at risk for suicide and treated with telehealth were 2.35 \u00b7 more likely to be admitted to the hospital than nontelehealth patients, with the vast majority of pa-tients in either treatment category (telehealth, n = 139 and nontelehealth, n = 139) subsequently admitted IP (88% and 78%, respectively). As the authors point out, limiting their assessment to ED patients at risk for suicide only, rather than evaluating patients across all-cause MH ED visits, likely represented a higher level of case severity overall than all-cause MH studies. 15 For this study, a small number of IC (8%) and non-IC (6%) patients were admitted to IP beds in the participating CAHs. In response to burgeoning MH IP needs statewide, there is currently one CAH in one county in northern Indiana not involved in this study that has incorporated 10 psychiatric IP beds into their rural safety net system. As rural CAH administrators and physicians become more accustomed to admitting behavioral health patients to an IP bed for observation and follow-up, perhaps other rural CAHs will consider seeking additional resources to (1) initiate 31 and/or (2) establish IP psychiatric beds and hire psychiatric physician(s) to manage these patients.",

In the aforementioned Iowa study, 31% of telehealth patients, and 50% of nontelehealth patients, experienced an involuntary hold for MH care. 15 In another study of MH patients in Virginia, 31 2624 adults were evaluated while experiencing an MH crisis. Upon assessment by an emergency services evaluator in their community (required in Virginia), 42% of patients were described as needing IC, 31% were referred to OP treatment (non-IC), 22% agreed to voluntary hospitalization, and 5% of patients declined services. 31 Per McGarvey and colleagues, 31 AOT was rarely used in place of IP IC in Virginia. Similarly, for this study, fewer IC patients were set up with OP treatment than with non-IC patients (23% vs. 47%, respectively). However, significantly improved MH outcomes have been observed with IC patients through a structured OP treatment program. 32 In a 4-year longitudinal randomized controlled trial Sch\u00f6ttle et al. 32 reported a 25% reduction in IC for seriously mentally ill patients (N = 171) through utilization of a structured OP MH treatment program (assertive community treatment [ACT]). The piloted ACT program was an OP extension of the hospital setting.",

In some U.S. states, licensed MH therapists, neuropsychologists, social workers, and MH counselors are only reimbursed for in-person care, but not care delivered through telehealth. 33 Community stakeholders and legislative policy makers need to be made aware of the critical nature of the public policy changes that would be needed to support expansion of provider-specific reimbursement plans, to promote increased utilization of telemental health in general. 33 Enhanced nonphysician provider reimbursement was not addressed by CMS in the aforementioned telehealth reimbursement changes for 2021. 38 Telemental care delivery and telehealth parity laws MH care experts have recently recommended creation of a robust evidence-driven continuum of care across the life span, extending from community-based OP MH services to psychiatric IP services. 1, 3 To support these initiatives in MH provider shortage areas, the introduction and implementation of telehealth parity laws would bolster all categories of payor reimbursement for telemental health. 33, 34 Comprehensive statewide telehealth parity laws requiring payors (public and private) to provide the same reimbursement amounts for telehealth care delivery compared with in-person care would allow health care administrators to seamlessly integrate all available licensed MH care professionals to collaboratively address community-level MH care needs. 33 Limitations This study has several limitations, and results should be interpreted cautiously. Utilization of an observational study design for enrolling participants in the study meant that all MH patients presenting to the rural EDs were able to access telemental care, allowing for no case control to be observed concurrently, to establish a ''telehealth vs. nontelehealth'' controlled comparison. This approach was preferred by IRB reviewers, so that all rural MH patients had access to specialist-based psychiatric care in the CAHs. Although the authors believe it is important to note and discuss emerging MH trends for children and adults in this regional study, results are not necessarily generalizable to other regions or groups of rural hospitals.",

            "text": "Most rural U.S. counties, including those in West Central Indiana, do not have community MH ''evaluators'' (i.e., Virginia), nor community MH centers with structured OP programs. However, owing to the increased incidence of MH cases overall, these CAHs typically had off-duty law enforcement officers on staff during busy times in their rural EDs. As Pinals and Fuller point out, ''Law enforcement and families rely on the Emergency Departments of their local hospitals for psychiatric crisis intervention . and the demand for competency restoration in state hospitals continues to grow.. Boarding [waiting for psych beds in EDs] is a symptom of need and resources that are not balanced.'' 3(pp. [14] [15] To this end, MH experts recently recommended broad-based implementation of the following: (1) the general public's access to, and education in, preventative MH care across the life span; (2) community ACT (supervised OP) programs; (3) MH training for law enforcement; (4) real-time information regarding IP psychiatric bed availability for EDs/hospitals in each state; (5) evaluation of current state laws and criteria governing IC; (6) increases in MH workforce funding; and (7) increases in Medicaid reimbursement. 3 Experienced ED clinicians and administrators tell us that the social and community challenges that MH patients face on a daily basis frequently impact ED throughput and resources, but also extend beyond the ED setting out into the communities. 42 Moreover, administrative, clinical, and patient/provider needs for EDs must be anticipated, monitored, and supported, especially in resource-poor rural hospitals. 42 As the gateway to critically needed MH care for rural residents, 2,8 attention must be paid to the need for more comprehensive community-wide MH services, 42 including the explicit recommendation to ''incentivize and reward the use of technology [telehealth] to advance care delivery, promote appropriate information sharing, and maximize continuity of care.'' 3(p.2) ",

The longer LOS for SA patients is likely due to life-saving measures implemented by ED staff related to potential or actual overdose, and/or waiting for patients to ''sober up'' and return to conscious and alert status for a more thorough assessment before discharge decision making. characteristics Total ED costs and reimbursement by IC status and major diagnostic group.

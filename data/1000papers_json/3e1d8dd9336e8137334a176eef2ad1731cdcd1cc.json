Most studies report a low incidence and little need for hospitalization in children. Nevertheless, up to 10% of hospitalized children under 1 year of age require PICU admission [1] . The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain were identified in February. The number of cases increased significantly during the following weeks [2] . Although children appear to be relatively spared of severe disease, the Spanish Ministry of Health reported over 200 children requiring admission to a pediatric ward, 10% of which were admitted to a PICU [3] .",

A complete analysis of the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spanish critically ill children is not possible yet, as some patients are still hospitalized. Though our registry includes more than 90% of Spanish PICUs, the absence of non-participating units may have created a selection bias. Another limitation is that it was not possible to discern whether SARS-CoV-2 infection was fully responsible or only a contributing factor for the whole clinical picture in some cases.

Renal failure was defined according to the KDIGO guidelines as the presence of urine output below 0.5 ml/kg/h for more than 6 h or as an increase on serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dl within 48 h or 1.5 baseline values. Heart dysfunction was defined using echocardiography as the existence of global or segmental motion abnormalities, dilated ventricles, reduced ejection fraction or by the presence of pericardial effusion. p-SOFA scores were calculated using the information of the first 24 h of admission IQR interquartile range, ADRS acute respiratory distress syndrome, PMIS pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, HFNC high flow nasal cannula, NIV non invasive ventilation, MV mechanical ventilation, PCT procalcitonin, CRP C-reactive protein a Some data were not available for all patients b Laboratory markers were available in 48 out of 50 patients ",

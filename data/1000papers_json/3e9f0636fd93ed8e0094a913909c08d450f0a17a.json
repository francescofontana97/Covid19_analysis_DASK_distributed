Here we report on genetic programs activated by interferons and the suppression by Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and deciphering its regulation is paramount for understanding the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identi ed candidate regulatory elements in the ACE2 locus in human primary airway cells and lung tissue. Activating histone and promoter marks and Pol II loading characterize the intronic dACE2 and de ne novel candidate enhancers distal to the genuine ACE2 promoter and within additional introns. dACE2, and to a lesser extent ACE2, RNA levels increased in primary cells treated with interferons and this induction was mitigated by JAK inhibitors that are used therapeutically in COVID-19 patients. Our analyses provide insight into ACE2 regulatory elements and highlight JAK inhibitors as suitable tools to suppress interferon-activated genetic programs in bronchial cells.",

            "text": "patients. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies have revealed that ACE2 expression in type II pneumocytes is induced by interferons 3 , suggesting that the presence of an autoregulatory loop could result in increased viral infection. Recent studies 4, 5 have identi ed a novel short form of ACE2, called dACE2, that originates from an intronic promoter activated by interferons, calling into question that transcription of the full length native ACE2 is under interferon control. Onabajo et al. 5 used ENCODE data for chromatin modi cation marks (H3K4me3, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) as well as DNase I hypersensitive (DHS) sites in cell lines to label putative regulatory elements at the newly identi ed exon (ex1c) located within intron 9 of the ACE2 gene. However, no regulatory elements were detected in the vicinity of the 5' end of the full-length transcript encoding biologically active ACE2, and in sequences distal to the genuine promoter. Since these data sets were obtained from a wide range of cell lines and not from human primary airway cells, the principal target of SARS-CoV-2, they might not present a comprehensive picture of the regulatory regions controlling expression of the dACE2 and the full-length ACE2 transcripts in bronchial tissue. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors suppress signal transduction pathways that lead to immune activation and in ammation and they are used therapeutically to harness cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients 6, 7 . However, the genetic programs activated in airway cells by interferons and their response to JAK inhibitors remain to be elucidated. In this study we pursued two linked goals. We used genome-wide chromatin pro ling and RNA-seq analyses to identify the regulation of ACE2 and dACE2 gene expression in human primary airway cells and we investigated the ability of JAK inhibitors to blunt interferonactivated genetic programs.",

            "text": "To comprehensively identify the genetic elements controlling the extended ACE2 locus, with an emphasis on its interferon response, we focused on human primary Small Airway Epithelial Cells (SAEC), which express a wide range of cytokine receptors and key mechanistic components of the executing JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway (Supplementary Table 1 ). We stimulated SAECs with interferon type I (IFNa and IFNb), type II (IFNg) and type III (IFNl) as well as with growth hormone (GH), Interleukin 6 (IL6) and IL7, followed by RNA-seq transcriptome analyses (Supplementary Tables 2-8 ). Increased ACE2 expression was obtained with the interferons but not with GH, IL6 and IL7 (Fig. 1a) . However, the induction was less than that seen for classical interferon stimulated genes (ISG), such as STAT1, ISG15 and ISG20 (Fig. 1b-c) . In agreement with earlier studies 4,5 , we detected the novel dACE2 N-terminal exon (ex1c) within intron 9 of the ACE2 gene (Fig. 1d) . To obtain additional information on the interferon response of the dACE2 and ACE2 promoters, we used RNA-seq and determined the respective read counts over the three alternative rst exons ( Fig. 1d-e) . While the increase of RNA-seq reads induced by IFNa/b was highest (~ 25-fold) over ex1c, a lesser, yet signi cant, ~ 2-10-fold increase was detected over ex1a and ex1b, supporting the notion that expression of the full-length ACE2 transcript is also under interferon control. As an independent assay we used qRT-PCR and determined that IFN a/b stimulation led to an 8 to 15-fold increase of dACE2 (ex1c) and an approximately ~ 3-fold increase of ACE2 RNA (ex9) (Fig. 1f) . However, the degree of induction of either form was lower than that seen for bona de ISGs. Previous studies in normal human bronchial epithelium (NHBE) did not reveal an interferon response of the native ACE2 promoter 4,5 suggesting differences between cell types or growth conditions. The mouse Ace2 gene is also induced by cytokines through a STAT5-based enhancer in the second intron 8 and a DHS site is located in the equivalent location in the human ACE2 gene in SAEC and lung tissue. This suggests the presence of additional regulatory elements controlling expression of the full-length ACE2 mRNA.",

DNase I hypersensitive (DHS) sites from human lung tissues 9 and SAECs 10 served as bona de predictors of regulatory regions. In addition to ACE2, the neighboring TMEM27 gene, an ACE2 homologue, as well as BMX are activated by interferons (Fig. 2a) suggesting the possibility of jointly used regulatory elements. ACE2 and TMEM27 originated from a gene duplication and their response to interferon is equivalent. The positions of the chromatin boundary factor CTCF suggests that ACE2 and TMEM27 are located within a sub-TAD (Fig. 2a ).",

In addition, we identi ed DHS sites at ex1a, likely marking the genuine ACE2 promoter, a distal site marking a possible enhancer and in intron 15 coinciding with activate marks. The DHS site in intron 9 overlaps with strong H3K4me3 marks, identifying it as a genuine promoter region (Fig. 2b) . This site is also decorated with H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks and extensive Pol II loading, hallmarks of a complex promoter/enhancer. H3K27ac and Pol II loading was further induced by IFNb, re ecting increased ACE2 expression. IFNb activates the transcription factors STATs 1, 2 and 5 ( Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 3) and ChIP-seq experiments from K562 erythroid cells stimulated with IFNb 11 revealed preferential binding of STAT5 to the intronic promoter/enhancer (Fig. 2c) further supporting regulation through the JAK/STAT pathway. The STAT1 locus served as a control for the binding of STAT transcription factors (Fig. 2d) . While the ACE2 promoter associated with ex1a is marked by a DHS site and H3K4me1 marks, there is little evidence of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks.

Here, we have assessed the extended ACE2 locus for regulatory elements controlling gene expression induced by interferons and other, not yet de ned, stimuli. We show that the intronic regulatory region bears promoter and enhancer marks and binds STAT transcription factors, thus constituting a complex regulatory element controlling interferon-induced dACE2 expression 5 . We also identi ed additional candidate regulatory elements throughout the locus that can be invoked in controlling transcription of the full-length transcripts yielding the biologically active ACE2. Regulation of the human and mouse ACE2 8 loci displays distinct differences, yet they share their response to cytokines and the JAK/STAT pathway, with the mouse Ace2 gene being activated in mammary tissue by cytokines through an intronic enhancer 8 RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).",

Our demonstration that JAK inhibitors mitigate interferon-induced activation of in ammatory programs has practical implications for their use in treating COVID-19 patients. Methods Cell culture. Human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) obtained from Lifeline Technology (FC-0016) were expanded using the complete BronchiaLife\u2122 media kit (Lifeline Technology, LL-0023). All culture wares were precoated in 30 \u00b5\u03b3/ml of Fibronectin (ThermoFisher Scienti c, 33016015) for at least 1 h at room temperature. Calu-3 line (ATCC, HTB-55\u2122) were cultured using Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (ATCC, 30-2003\u2122) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Cytiva, SH3007103) in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C.

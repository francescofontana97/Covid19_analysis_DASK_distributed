From this point of view, as the risk suppression measures started to bear fruit, Member States progressively lifted some of the restrictions and introduced new risk management measures: see A Alemanno, \"The European response to COVID-19: From regulatory emulation to regulatory coordination?\" 11 (2020) EJRR 307-16. However, this article uses the notion Phase I as used by the Italian government. To this end, and also due to the temporal proximity with the events observed, this article analyses official documents as well as newspaper articles. 2 See in particular Decree-Law No 6 of 23 February 2020, which, after conferring on competent authorities the powers to issuein case of specific signs of the pandemic spreadingemergency orders adequate and proportionate to the evolving emergency situation (Art 1(1)), and listing some types of those orders (Art 1(2)), conferred on the same authorities the power to adopt further measures as to prevent the spread of the pandemic \"even beyond the occurrence of conditions described by Article 1(i)\". The Italian legal system provides for several emergency powers for the protection of health, to be issued in the form of emergency orders (ordinanze). Ordinanze are orders issued by administrative authorities faced with specific situations that urgently require extraordinary measures. Due to their function, these orders enjoy a special legal status: first, they may derogate from legislation currently in force, and second, their content is not legally predetermined (in this sense, they are atypical acts), as they may lay down any provisions that authorities feel are needed to tackle the situation. 3 Following the declaration of the state of emergency, 4 when it was clear that the coronavirus was circulating in Lombardy, the government approved Decree-Law No 6 of 23 February 2020, 5 vesting the PM (President of the Council of Ministers) and other non-specified \"competent authorities\" with wide ranging powers to handle the emergency by issuing emergency administrative orders (ordinanze), both typical and atypical, the latter referring to measures to be adopted even beyond the occurrence of conditions described by the primary source. A Decree-Law (Decreto Legge) is a form of executive rule-making with the force of law, adopted by the Government in extraordinary cases of necessity and urgency, issued by the President of the Republic and immediately introduced to Parliament to be \"converted\" into law. The conversion must take place within 60 days, or the decree loses effect retroactively, that is, from the day it was initially adopted. This is the main tool provided by the Italian Constitution (Article 77) to counter emergencies. 6 Decree-Law No 6/2020 (and the following measures) constituted the basis for the Decreti del Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri (DPCMs), which imposed severe limitations on constitutional freedoms. 7 DPCM is a generic format, which may hold any sort of administrative content delegated to the PM by ordinary law. The DPCMs issued during the pandemic have had the legal nature of ordinanze, allowing the PM to adopt them \"by way of derogation from every legislation in force, while complying 3 The legal framework for the use of emergency orders is composite: pursuant to Art 32 of Law No 833 of 23 December 1978 (the basic law on the national healthcare system), emergency powers are shared among three levels of government: (i) the Minister of Health; (ii) presidents of Regions; and (iii) mayors. Further emergency powers are attributed to mayors by Art 50(4-5) of Legislative Decree No 267 of 18 August 2000, and by Art 117 of Legislative Decree No 112 of 31 March 1998. These provisions reflect the traditional role of the chief of the municipality as a local health authority, particularly in case of emergencies. There also exists legislation on civil protection (disaster relief), recently consolidated in the Code of Civil Protection of 2 January 2018. According to the Code the legal tool for dealing with a state of national emergency is the ordinanze di protezione civile referred to in Art 25. These acts are adopted by the Head of the Department for Civil Protection (the PM or his/her delegate) after seeking an agreement (intesa) with the affected Regions, and their aim is to provide support to the population and to restore basic services and infrastructures. The ordinanze can derogate from the laws in force but must respect the general principles of the legal system (Art 25 (1) with general principles of the legal system\". Apart from \"general principles\", the only legislative sources that apply to DPCMs are the Code of Civil Protection, giving the PM the power to enact such regulatory measures and the Decree-Laws, providing for the use of such measures. 8 In the following subsection, a brief overview of the problems raised by these legislative and administrative measures is given.",

            "text": "The legal debate initially focused on the legality of the use of Decree-Laws to deal with the emergency. In the beginning of the emergency, the use of such instruments was so widespread as to engender doubts as to the primary condition for the Government to use this legislative tool: its extraordinary character. The criticism, mainly driven by opposition parties, focused on the risk of \"marginalising\" Parliament by making the use of Decree-Laws commonplace. 9 The discussion then moved on the formulation of the Decree-Laws adopted by the Italian government. For some scholars, their vague provisions challenged the rule of law in its \"substantive\" sense (principio di legalit\u00e0 in senso sostanziale) as specified by the Italian Constitutional Court, in the sense that powers conferred on administrative authorities have to be regulated, at least to some extent, by law. 10 In particular, Decree-Law No 6, with rather vague wording, stated that the PM and the other \"competent authorities\" can intervene, by the means provided for by such a legislative act, even outside the cases of emergency described therein. The openendedness of the provision generated scholarly debate as to whether Decree-Law No 6 offers a sufficiently clear and precise basis for every measure subsequently enacted, particularly, the strict limitations on individual rights and liberties set out in DPCMs of 8, 9 and 11 March 2020. 11 The vagueness of this Decree-Law has been 8 See Massa, supra, note 3. The peculiar legal nature of the DPCMs issued during the pandemic has been analysed in the literature. See EC Raffiotta, \"Sulla legittimit\u00e0 dei provvedimenti del governo a contrasto dell'emergenza virale da coronavirus\" (2020) 2 BioLaw Journal <www.biodiritto.org/content/download>, or M Luciani, \"Il sistema delle fonti del diritto alla prova dell'emergenza\" (2020) 2 Rivista AIC <www.rivistaaic.it/it/rivista/ultimi-contributi-pubblicati>. See also the judgment No 8615 of Lazio TAR, Rome, Section I-quater, 22 June 2020, in which the court refused the legal nature of general administrative acts of DPCMs, linking them, because of their \"peculiar atypicality\", to the ordinanze <www.giustizia-amministrativa.it>. 9 The use of Decree-Laws to manage the pandemic made government the key player. Some newspapers and scholars spoke of the \"absence\" of Parliament; see C Melzi D'Eril and GE Vigevani, \"Il Parlamento non sia assente durante la pandemia\", Il Sole 24 Ore (Milan, 15 March 2020) 6; A Lucarelli, \"Costituzione, fonti del diritto ed emergenza sanitaria\" (2020) 2 Rivista AIC <www.rivistaaic.it/it/rivista/ultimi-contributi-pubblicati/alberto-lucarelli/costituzione-fonti-deldiritto-ed-emergenza-sanitaria>; S Curreri, \"Il Parlamento nell'emergenza\" (2020) 3 Osservatorio AIC <www. osservatorioaic.it/it/osservatorio/ultimi-contributi-pubblicati/salvatore-curreri/il-parlamento-nell-emergenza>. 10 See judgment 115/2011 of the Constitutional Court <www.cortecostituzionale.it/actionSchedaPronuncia.do? anno=2011&numero=115> according to which the primary source can hand powers over to administrative authorities, but basic political decisions regarding individual rights and liberties have to be made in the form of legislative norms, which have to supply the administrative act with sufficient guidance. Among scholars who affirmed the inconsistency of Decree-Law No 6 with the rule of law, see A Lucarelli as well as Curreri, supra, note 9, and G Delledonne and C Padula, \"Italy: The Impact of the Pandemic Crisis on the Relations between the State and the Regions\" in E Hondius et al (eds), Coronavirus and the Law in Europe <www.intersentiaonline.com/ bundle/coronavirus-and-the>. 11 In particular, with the DPCM of 8 March 2020, the Government imposed a lockdown in Lombardy and 14 other provinces of northern Italy introducing several legal prohibitions, such as the ban on people travelling to and from places in the red zones. With the subsequent national lockdown, the Government imposed a travel ban in the entire country and criticised not only for its provisions imposing limitations, but also for those regulating the relationships between central and regional ordinances to be adopted to counter the emergency. It led to a situation in which, as soon as the emergency became manifest, some Regions and municipalities introduced more severe measures than those adopted centrally, often causing confusion and uncertainty. 12",

See also L Giacomelli and E Lamarque \"The Italian Constitutional Court and the Pandemic: A National and Comparative Perspective\" in Hondius et al (eds), supra, note 10. 16 President Cartabia underlined that the Constitution does not provide for special rules in case of emergency, and this was a conscious choice. Some scholars suggested, on the contrary, a constitutional reform: see A Vedaschi and C Graziani, \"Coronavirus Emergency and Public Law Issues: An Update on the Italian Situation\" (2020) Verfassungsblog <verfassungsblog.de/coronavirus-emergency-and-public-law-issues-an-update-on-the-italian-situation/>. This new Decree-Law also has the merit of validating previously adopted measures. Therefore, various DPCM provisions imposing penalties for violations of lockdown measures were, from then on, enforced directly by an act equivalent to law. From this perspective, it has been argued that primary rules were consistent with the principle of the rule of law. 18 As regards the voluminous use of DPCMs and the possible violations of local authorities' competence, scholars have drawn attention to the temporary nature of those measures and the special expedited procedure provided for their adoption, involving regional representatives. 19 In those days, the president of the Republic and the president of the Constitutional Court did not miss the chance to underline the relevance of \"loyal cooperation\" between different institutions, defined as the \"institutional side of solidarity\". 20 Judicial review promptly solved critical situations of inconsistency among emergency orders adopted centrally and locally: local orders overstepping legislative limitations have been quashed by administrative courts. 21 Most of the instances of lack of coordination were, ultimately, due to policy-makers' political differences.",

The governance of the pandemic through soft law represents a significant part of legislative activity in Italy after the \"flattening of the curve\" of contagion in the spring 2020. The centrality of the precautionary principle and the need to organise the several activities that were allowed to restart have determined the choice of suitable legal instruments to prevent a new spread of COVID-19. To this end, non-typical acts, not always traceable back to traditional sources of law, and which can then be considered as soft law, 22 have entered the Italian legal system. However, although the phenomenon of soft law has been mentioned at 18 Zagrebelsky, supra, note 13; Massa, supra, note 3. 19 Decree-Laws No 6/2020 and No 19/2020 stipulate that prior to the adoption of DPCMs the advice of the President of the Conference of the Regions, or of the presidents of the Regions themselves, for measures affecting only their territories is needed.

Contra Delledonne and Padula, supra, note 10. 20 See the report of President Cartabia, supra, note 16, and the public statements by the President of the Republic, Sergio Mattarella, on 5 March 2020 about the Coronavirus emergency <www.quirinale.it/elementi/45537>. 21 Administrative rulings about the pandemic are collected in the dedicated section of the official website: <www. giustizia-amministrativa.it/covid19-focus>. For a comment on the inconsistency among emergency orders adopted centrally and locally, see A D'Aloia, \"L'art 120 Cost, la libert\u00e0 di circolazione e l'insostenibile ipotesi delle ordinanze regionali di chiusura dei 'propri confini'\" (2020) Dirittifondamentali <dirittifondamentali.it/2020/04/18/ lart-120-cost-la-liberta-di-circolazione-e-linsostenibile-ipotesi-delle-ordinanze-regionali-di-chiusura-dei-propriconfini/>. 22 conferences of Italian scholars of constitutional and administrative law, 23 and despite the fact that some of those measures have attracted criticism from the general public, the use of soft law by the Italian authorities has not been investigated to a great extent by academia. 24 In general, the debate about soft law in Italy is not focused on the rule-sanction relationship, but rather on the willingness of third parties to comply with such rules (and, if we think about the uncertainties of the pandemic, \"to know how to comply\"), echoing what Vittorio Ottaviano has pointed out: any rule exists if someone is convinced that that rule is in force, since all rules require adherence to their stipulations. 25 Soft law indeed reflects a \"functionalist\" conception of law, understood as a \"social technique\" that serves to influence human conduct. 26 Italian legislators have progressively introduced some forms of soft law in different fields. Despite the critical attitude of a number of Italian scholars towards its use in public law, 27 the legislator uses it as an instrument of \"sharing of good practices\", 28 a form of a \"flexible regulation\" tool and a technique to provide \"interpretative aid\" for the addressees, 29 aimed at encouraging \"homogeneous behaviour\". 30 At the time of the COVID-19 emergency, guidelines and other soft law instruments have made a comeback into the Italian legislator's toolbox. This is a useful perspective from which to approach the complex regulatory framework that came into being during the pandemic. In the emergency scenario, soft law measures seem to provide some advantages to deal with a number of critical issues posed by the pandemic. However, those measures also contain challenges and pitfalls.",

Most of the general prevention measures are related to concrete aspects of daily life and affect both the private and public sphere of individuals' lives (social relationships, economic activities, worship, public services, etc). COVID-19 hard law is, in other words, quite detailed. Soft law measures that were passed to complement hard law measures were also detailed, leading to difficulties in 23 Posters and recordings of the webinars are available in the webpage of the Italian Association of Administrative Law Professors <https://www.aipda.it/>. 24 C Mancuso, \"La giustizia di fronte all'emergenza: il rinnovato ruolo del soft law\" (2020) Judicium <www. judicium.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Carolina-Mancuso.pdf>.

Second, the pandemic regulation has required the constant intervention of public authorities to ensure that residents have all the information they need in order to carry out their personal and economic affairs. In the framework of a swiftly changing situation, non-binding measures have the advantage of being easily adopted and amended. At the same time, flexibility may also give rise to uncertainties, especially when the same measure is modified several times. The high number of (overlapping) soft law measures can create confusion about which one is in force at a certain time. This requires a commitment from the community to inform itself frequently and to keep up to date with the many measures taken by the regulator.",

For example, general guidelines on reducing the risk of contagion for individuals and the community in all economic sectors are set out in the technical documents produced by INAIL (National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work) and ISS (Higher Institute for Health). 31 Sometimes guidelines are combined with other documents. For example, technical data sheets, attached to the DPCMs, contain specific guidelines for certain sectors of activity. 32 These technical data sheets summarise, for each activity, different prevention and containment measures to 31 See <www.inail.it/cs/internet/comunicazione/pubblicazioni/catalogo-generale/pubbl-doc-tecn-ipotesi-rimodparrucchieri-trattamenti-estetici.html>. A second type of soft law document that has been widely used is the so-called protocols (protocolli). One relevant example is the protocol concluded between the Court of First Instance of Rome and its Council of the Bar Association 33 for carrying out hearings through remote connection and written notes, 34 drawn up according to the standards indicated by the Superior Council of Judiciary (CSM). 35 Since the first phase of \"judicial quarantine\", the justice sector has experienced a gradual resumption of judicial activities with \"alternative\" modalities such as with remote hearings or with the exchange of written notes. With respect to these alternative working arrangements, Decree-Law No 18 of 17 March 2020 has ensured a minimum level of guarantees needed for the exercise of constitutionally protected rights. The Decree-Law has indicated only fundamental principles and delegated to judicial offices the task of identifying the detailed guidance, thus encouraging, directly or indirectly, the use of atypical sources of regulation. 36 Another example of a protocol is the Workplace Safety protocol, signed on 14 March 2020, and updated on 24 April 2020. 37 This protocol ensures the maximum protection of workers' health and the necessary safety conditions in all workplaces, with specific reference to the current health emergency. The text was prepared jointly by social partners (employers' and employees' organisations) and the competent ministers on the basis of the instructions on the management of COVID-19 risks in workplaces given by the Ministry of Health. Fundamental to the adoption of this protocol is the preliminary opinion by a technical body specifically created for the health emergency, the Technical-Scientific Committee (hereafter T-SC). 38 According to its provisions, companies are called on to adapt to these precautionary measures to ensure the resumption of economic activities.",

We will now turn to the legal and practical effects of these soft law measures. Some soft law was used as an instrument in and of itself. This is seen in the case of guidelines set out in the technical documents produced by INAIL and ISS. These instruments had the merit of being among the first aimed at contagion reduction. In this respect, they became the model soft law rules, detailing the first rules that all actors that have promulgated soft law have subsequently followed and further developed in view of the reopening of economic activities. 54 With respect to the justice sector, the few authors who have discussed soft law argue that, at the organisational level, the soft law measures adopted have played a great role in rationalising procedures and the administrative activities of judicial offices. 55 48 For example, following the DPCM 3 November 2020, by specifying the division of \"yellow\", \"orange\" and \"red\" areas on the national territory according to the contagion assessment, or what is meant by \"condition of need\", which allows displacement between Regions despite the high contagion assessment, see <www.governo.it/it/articolo/ domande-frequenti-sulle-misure-adottate-dal-governo/15638?gclid=Cj0KCQiAzZL-BRDnARIsAPCJs73fQi-VEqrf980wwcox1FEOVmJcJtBIyKA7JefuN_YHPWa4_bcDTiYaAu_ZEALw_wcB#zone>. 49 For example, for visits to minors whose parents are divorced, see <www.governo.it/it/articolo/domande-frequentisulle-misure-adottate-dal-governo/15638?gclid=Cj0KCQiAzZL-BRDnARIsAPCJs73fQi-VEqrf980wwcox1FEOV mJcJtBIyKA7JefuN_YHPWa4_bcDTiYaAu_ZEALw_wcB#zone>. 50 G Morbidelli, \"Linee guida dell'ANAC: comandi o consigli?\" (2016) Dir amm 273. 51 S Sotgiu, \"Faq nuova fonte di diritto? Il governo faccia chiarezza. Parla Guzzetta\" (April 2020) <formiche.net/ 2020/04/guzzetta-faq-restrizioni/> accessed August 2020. See also A Monti, \"Linee guida, fonti del diritto e (ir) responsabilit\u00e0\", arguing that the use of FAQ leads to the erosion of the boundaries separating the powers of the state, in particular between the executive and the courts interpreting the laws <formiche.net/2020/05/linee-guidairresponsabilita/>. 52 For example, DPCM 26 April 2020, Art 1(1a) allows travel only to meet \"relatives\" (literally: congiunti). The word congiunti differs from the lexicon used by family law in the Italian civil code and laws. As a result, the government has resolved the confusion, providing through the FAQ an interpretation listing the subjects that can be considered congiunti and in particular highlighting that the meaning of the term can be indirectly derived, systematically, from the rules on kinship and affinity as well as from the jurisprudence on civil liability: <www.governo.it/it/faq-fasedue>. 53 Monti, supra, note 51, argues that this underlies the political choice of transferring risk and responsibility from institutions to private entities, including the weaker ones, without any protection mechanism. 54 They are referred to, for example, in the DPCM of 17 May 2020. 55 Mancuso, supra, note 24.",

This was the case as regards technical data sheets. These measures represented useful tools for citizens and economic operators who, thanks to the summary offered in data sheets, could obtain a clearer picture of the rules established for their sector of activity. 57 FAQs have also had a mainly interpretative function. Scholars have raised questions about the accountability of information contained in FAQs especially given the high reliance of citizens on such documents. 58 Two critical elements have been highlighted. First, the FAQs have not been issued as a result of predefined procedures. Second, unlike guidelines and protocols which are often quoted by the DPCMs, FAQs are not referred to by any norm in force. As a result, there seems to be a risk in the possible confusion created by the overlapping of competences of authorities and the excessive number of measures adopted. This is a real paradox if we think about the purpose of the FAQs.",

Other Regions, for instance Campania, acted independently with ordinanza No 48 of 17 May 2020. 67 That Region, instead of referring to the guidelines approved by the Conference, prepared four different guidelines, each relating to a specific economic sector or group of activities. The final group of Regions, such as Lazio with ordinanza No 41 of 16 May 2020, 68 referred to the guidelines approved by the Conference of the Regions, modifying them in some respects to better adapt them to the regional context. The provisions adopted at state level of both Decree-Law No 33 and DPCM of 17 May 2020 have ensured the overall consistency of the soft law measures, making it extremely difficult for the guidelines prepared at the Conference and regional level to diverge from them. It seems, therefore, that the margin of autonomy left to the Regions to respond to local specificities has not affected overall coherence. In fact, a degree of convergence was reached within the Conference, the mandate of which is to promote coordination between the Regions. The T-SC also played a decisive role in ensuring that all the regional guidelines were coherent. In other words, the regional guidelineseven in the case of Regions that did not refer to the guidelines approved by the Conference of Regionsare considered to replicate those approved within the Conference.

However, after the adoption of those protocols and guidelines, economic operators generally complied with the precautionary measures contained in the protocols and guidelines. 70 This is partly because some of the rumoured rules, such as the requirement of keeping a safe distance of two metres between restaurant tables or of sanitising clothing after each use of a shop's dressing room did not appear in the final 69 \"Coronavirus: in tutta Italia le proteste di chi vuole riaprire\" ANSA (Rome, 30 April 2020) <www.ansa.it/sito/ notizie/cronaca/2020/04/29/a-milano-la-protesta-dei-commercianti>. 70 The Italian Agency of Statistics analysed a sample of 90,000 firms and pointed out a high standard of attention to health precautions, even beyond imposed rules: see Istat \"Situazioni e prospettive delle imprese nell'emergenza sanitaria COVID-19\" <www.istat.it/it/files//2020/06/Imprese-durante-Covid-19.pdf>. text of protocols.

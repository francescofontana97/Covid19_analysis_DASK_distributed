Disaster management system of Korea consists of the central safety management committee, headed by the prime minister and subcommittees headed by the ministers of various government ministries. The central safety management committee supervises and coordinates overall policy related to disaster and safety, and also promotes negotiations and coordination among the relevant ministries. The subcommittees help ensure the seamless operation of the central committee, especially, the coordination committee under the Minister of Public Administration and Security, is in charge of the overall process of negotiations and coordination with regard to tasks delegated by the central committee. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) provides emergency medical service (EMS) to Korea and plays a key role in the response to disasters and MCIs in most communities. A single-tiered fire-based EMS handles disasters and MCIs occurring throughout the entire Korean region and includes 16 regional headquarters of the fire department with a total of 1,400 advanced ambulances and 5,400 EMS providers.

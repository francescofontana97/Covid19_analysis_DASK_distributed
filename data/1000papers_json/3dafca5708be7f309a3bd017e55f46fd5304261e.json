Hospitals started to reorganize into intensive care units (ICUs) to manage COVID-19 1 cases, and most decisions were made at a single-center level and in a \"day-by-day\" manner. Hematology care is particularly complex because it deals with malignant and benign diseases, rare conditions, highly expensive drugs, and life-saving nondeferrable therapies.

Seventeen nonurgent bone marrow samplings were postponed. Urgent transfusions were guaranteed, and transfusiondependent patients adapted their schedules to fit with donor availability (1 unit per week instead of 2 units per 14 days), because the transfusion center experienced a marked reduction in donors. With regard to hospitalization, admissions to the hematology and transplant wards showed a decrease at week 1; thereafter, the limited number of admissions did not allow for definitive conclusions to be made (paradoxical increase, as shown in Table 1 ). With regard to reallocation of HCPs, from 24 February 2020, hematology/ transplant wards were separated from the internal medicine wards, where potentially COVID-19 1 patients could be admitted from the Emergency Department. In the general reorganization of the hospital, some personnel from the hematology unit were reasssigned to COVID-19 1 wards. From 2 March 2020, laboratory and trial office on-site personnel were reduced, and telecommuting was instituted. Figure 1A shows the progressive adoption of personal protective equipment (PPE) starting with surgical masks and disposable gloves and proceeding to filtering face piece-2 masks, protective eye goggles, and water-repellent disposable coats. The waiting room of the outpatient clinic was reorganized to guarantee social distancing (2 m), with limited access for relatives/caregivers. From 16 March 2020, body temperature and history of symptoms were recorded every day for anyone (HCPs and visitors) at the entrance of the clinic/day service. Suspected cases were isolated in a protected area before medical evaluation and the nasopharingeal swab results (performed in a dedicated room that was sanitized every day). Outpatients were tested if symptomatic for COVID-19 or if they had to be admitted to the hematology/ transplant ward. The procedure allowed us to identify 2 positive cases among symptomatic outpatients; all patients to be admitted were negative ( Figure 1B ). All HCPs were tested at week 6, with negative results. Overall, the progressive adoption of protective measures and careful anamnesis of symptoms and contacts appeared to be useful to identify potential positive cases, whereas the systematic use of nasal-pharyngeal swabs, although useful, is affected by low sensitivity. 7 A progressive implementation of telemedicine was adopted. As shown in Figure 1C , the number of e-mails and telephone calls increased, along with a decrease in outpatient visits. A total of 2530 contacts aimed at evaluating patients' external laboratory/radiology results and/or at giving specific advice/prescriptions on medications/procedures were recorded. Home sampling performed by nurses of the hematology unit was interrupted to prevent patient/ HCP exposure, whereas patients were favorably sampled at external local laboratories.

However, it is not possible to collect NPS in some patients, such as those with epistaxis or with an inflamed nasopharyngeal mucous membrane. Part of those patients must be regularly controlled with PCR to be able to go to work, and they suffer discomforts due to sampling.

For each patient, three sample types were collected including NPS, NMTS, and saliva samples. NPS and NMTS samples were collected using a standard technique, as recommended by the manufacturer (Allplex TM 2019-nCoV Assay insert), and transported to the laboratory in a viral transport medium that was prepared according to the standard operating procedure of the CDC in the United States (13) . Saliva samples were collected through an assisted selfsampling; it was asked to patients to collect saliva by tilting the head back for 10s and then spit it into a sterile vial. A total of 1-2 mL of saliva per patient was collected and processed.",

However, our data are valuable since all sampling methods provided from the same patients and our study included positive and negative samples for SARS-Cov-2. Through this study design, we eliminated the difference of sensitivity that can surge between the different sampling methods due to differences in the clinical background of patients and in the sample collection, because all samples are collected in the same patient and at the same time. Our data revealed differences in the sensitivity of SARS-Cov-2 detection obtained for the three sampling methods. Saliva sampling allowed to detect all cases with Ct values <33 (Figure 3) suggesting that the saliva sample might be a promising alternative method for COVID-19 diagnosis. It has been reported that Ct values > 35 correlates with a lesser infectivity of SARS-Cov-2 in cell culture (25) . In addition, only one RT-qPCR kit, the Allplex TM 2019-nCoV Assay Kit was used in our study for the SARS-Cov-2 detection in saliva samples. Although the Allplex TM 2019-nCoV Assay Kit provided valuable results, this fact did not exclude that other RT-qPCR kits could improve the sensibility of the detection in this kind of sample. In effect, it previously showed a wide variability in the sensitivity of RT-qPCR solutions for SARS-CoV-2 detection, principally due to a component difference of RT-qPCR kits (buffers, enzymes, and reagent contents in general) (26) .",

This is consistent with previous literature (10) , emphasizing that a single negative test does not rule out disease in patients with a high pre-test probability of COVID-19. To elude this issue, it should be considered repeated sampling and/or collected various sample types in the same patient for improving the yield. For example, among patients with a high pre-test probability for COVID-19 and a negative NPS swab, repeating the NPS swab and also collecting a saliva sample could be considered. In addition, saliva sample has clinical advantages because the sampling method is non-invasive and can be collected by patients themselves. However, a self-sample collection of saliva required that patients receive previously clear instructions. Just asking patients to spit a teaspoon of saliva into a specimen container can lead to not providing a full teaspoon of saliva, which can then affect the sensitivity of the COVID-19 diagnostic. To avoid this problem, saliva samples of our study were collected according to an in-house-validated protocol from which nursing staff assessed the collection of saliva samples. Other studies testing saliva samples for COVID-19 diagnostics used self-collected saliva samples, which cannot ensure data accuracy. Without clear instruction and training, patients can contribute to the increased risks of sample contamination and decrease the quality of collected samples that can affect the pathogen detection (false negatives and positives) and then the diagnostic.",

When the samples were collected during the 2nd week of illness or later, this difference of sensitivity between both sampling methods was increased by 20% (27) . The saliva flow rate might be involved in this phenomenon, because it could differ according to the advance of the disease and then affect the viral load in the saliva. It is therefore important to consider the time of illness for the determination of sampling methods; NPS samples seem more sensitive than saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection during the later illness.",

In comparison with others such as nasopharyngeal and nasal samples, saliva samples present a higher risk of spillage. To avoid this problem, saliva collection devices are available. However, the use of this equipment increases the cost of the clinical test, risen by close to 30%. In general, sampling kits such as those for nasopharyngeal and nasal samples include swabs and transport medium, in contrast to sampling saliva. There are few specialized devices for saliva samples that include transport media to preserve viral RNA saliva samples, and they are more expensive compared to the NPS sampling kits. The cost of clinical diagnosis remains an important point, because not all health insurance programs can support it. For example, although the Chilean State subsidizes the provision of PCR test, through the \"Fondo Nacional de Salud\" (FONASA), it does not include the supplementary devices resulting from the saliva sample process. For this reason, it is sometimes necessary to prepare wide-mouth containers with viral transport media for saliva sampling. Unlike to others, because they are more viscous, saliva samples require a pre-treatment step, with proteinase K spending more time in processing.",

Although saliva samples have a lower analytical sensitivity, they represent a promising alternative sampling method if the NPS cannot be considered. In addition, it should be interesting in the future to evaluate other RT-qPCR kits, because it could improve the detection of SARS-Cov-2 in saliva samples.",

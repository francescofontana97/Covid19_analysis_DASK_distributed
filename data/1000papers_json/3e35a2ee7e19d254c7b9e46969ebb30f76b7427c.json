The aim of this study was to develop a model to estimate the effect of undocumented infections, seasonal infectivity, immunity, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing, on the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in New York State (NYS). Simulations revealed dramatic infectivity driven by undocumented infections, and a peak basic reproductive number in NYS of 5.7. NPIs have been effective, and relaxation >50% will result in tens-of-thousands more deaths. Endemic infection is likely to occur in the absence of profound sustained immunity. As a result, until an effective vaccine or other effective pharmaceutical intervention is developed, it will be critical to not reduce NPIs >50% below current levels. This study establishes fundamental characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which can help policymakers navigate combating this virus in the coming years.",

Since SARS-CoV-2 surfaced in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China in December of 2019, the virus has caused significant global morbidity and mortality with over 3 million cases and 235,000 deaths worldwide [1] [2] [3] . By late April 2020, the United States had accumulated the most cases of SARS-CoV-2 globally, with New York State (NYS) emerging as the epicenter [3] . Local and federal governments have attempted to restrict the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through mandating social distancing, suspending non-essential services, and increasing the testing capacity of health systems [4] . Key unanswered questions are: How effective are these measures at diminishing the active pandemic, and how long might they need to last?",

The number of undocumented, but infectious, individuals is a critical variable in modulating the infectivity of respiratory viruses [6, 7] . Recent studies suggest that between 40-95% of all SARS-CoV-2 cases may be undocumented [8, 9] . Serological data from NYS indicate that ~10-20% of the affected population have detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, even though only ~2% have tested positive thus far [10] . Based on these studies, an undocumented infection rate of 75% was selected for this modelling work. An 11-compartment model was developed to comprehensively model SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics (see Methods and Supplementary Methods, Fig S1) . The model was optimized to SARS-CoV-2 case data from New York State with the particle swarm algorithm, and confidence intervals were estimated by introducing lognormal gaussian noise to the source data and randomly sampling initial parameter estimates (see Methods; Tables S1-2) [11, 12] . Sensitivity analysis revealed the model was most sensitive to variations of b, which represents the average number of contacts per individual per day (see Methods; Figures S2-3) . Comparison of the model to NYS case-data revealed a good fit (see Methods; Figure S4 ).",

This model represents an important advancement over recent studies as it incorporates the effect   of undocumented infections, seasonal variability, and sustained immunity on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in NYS (Figs. 1A-C, S5) [5, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Projecting through September 1 st , 2020, if the social distancing measures implemented on March 22 nd , 2020 are not relaxed, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will plateau by mid-July 2020: ~1.53 million people in NYS will be infected (undocumented infected+ confirmed symptomatic infected), with ~95,000 total hospitalizations, and ~28,000 deaths ( Fig. 1D-F) [18] . The maximum basic reproductive number (R0), which describes the infectivity of a pathogen, over this period was 5.7, significantly greater than the R0 reported by other published models of SARS-CoV-2 (R0 = 1.6-3.0) [13, 14, 19] . To account for the rapid growth in testing availability and implementation over the initial period of the outbreak, the maximum basic reproductive number was estimated after the daily rate of change in the ratio of positive tests to confirmed tests was negative for 7 consecutive days (see Supplementary   Methods ). These data demonstrate that the infectious potential of SARS-CoV-2 has thus far been dramatically underestimated, and reveal transmission dynamics that are driven by vast numbers of undocumented infections.",

Moderate reduction of social distancing (\u226450%), independent of the time at which the relaxation was initiated, resulted in minimal differences in total deaths by September 1 st , 2020 (total deaths: 30%, ~30,000; 50%, ~32,000; Fig. 2D ). Next, the instantaneous effective reproductive number (R(t)) was analyzed to quantify the magnitude of social distancing reduction required to initiate a second outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. R(t) differs from R0 as it describes the fraction of the population that is susceptible to infection as a function of time [20] .

To test if a phased approach was superior to a one-time relaxation of social distancing, serial social distancing relaxations, each with a duration of 14 days, were simulated at various time points (Fig. S7) . For the majority of relaxation magnitudes, one-time relaxation was comparable to phased relaxation; however, phased relaxation was superior for large magnitude reductions in social distancing (one-time 75% vs. phased 75%: ~71,000 vs ~40,000 deaths by September 1 st , 2020).

This model is designed to describe key features of the virus, such as the effect of undocumented infections on transmission, the development of sustained immunity to the virus, change in infectivity with weather, and the effect of nonpharmaceutical interventions to mitigate the outbreak. This study reveals that dynamic social distancing measures are essential and critical to controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and that in the absence of development of profound immunity caused by infection or the development of an efficacious vaccine, the virus is very likely to become endemic.",

The magnitude of the model's estimated R0 reflects the vast number of predicted undocumented infections in NYS at the start of the outbreak. Based on serological studies, a 75% undocumented infection rate was implemented in this study (see Methods) [8] [9] [10] .

However, if they are reduced more than 50%, R(t) will become >1, and morbidity and mortality will dramatically increase. NPIs will need to rely not only on social distancing, but also on improved testing, isolation, and contact tracing. Indeed, intensive testing and case-based interventions have become essential to control efforts in countries across the globe [28] [29] [30] .

Thus, the model can be applied to any city, region, or country by modifying the population density variable.

This was in part due to the earlier shelter in place order (March 16 th , 2020 vs. March 22 nd , 2020 in NYS), but may also reflect a less dense population [18, 32] .

For example, a number of studies have concluded that NPIs are essential to mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 19] . Additionally, a recent study revealed that substantial undocumented infections were essential to the rapid dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 in China [5] . Seasonal infectivity has been analyzed by other models, which together also predict seasonal establishment of endemic SARS-CoV-2 transmission [14, 34] .",

These data likely have errors in their estimations; thus, the model projections may overestimate or underestimate true epidemiological characteristics. Additionally, these data do not account for the relative lack in testing that occurred during the initial period of the NYS outbreak. As a result, the reported confirmed cases likely are under representative, which may influence the model towards higher infectivity. Second, a fixed parameter approach was chosen for a number of variables including average incubation period (g -1 ), average time to hospitalization (d -1 ), latency to non-hospitalized quarantine (q -1 ), and the effective rate of undocumented infections (n; see Supplementary Methods; Table S1 ). The values of these parameters were chosen based on literature; however, in reality they likely change over time. Third, the seasonal variability SARS-CoV-2 transmission was modelled after non-SARS-CoV-2 HCoV seasonal variability. This assumption was conservatively weighted because the .

The magnitude of the outbreak depends on the resumption of social distancing measures, where stronger measures implemented early result in significantly reduced morbidity and mortality through September 1 st , 2021 (% social distancing, cumulative deaths: 100%, ~58,000; 75%, ~92,000; 50%, ~154,000; Fig. 3D). However, analysis of the R(t) indicates that the potential for a second outbreak is extremely high, where no combinations of social distancing strength and implementation date were successful in preventing R(t) > 1(Figs. 3E, F). Together, these data predict a significant second outbreak in early 2021 that can be mitigated, but not avoided entirely, through the resumption of strong social distancing measures.",

The data extracted were the total number of confirmed cases, total number of hospitalizations, active hospitalizations, and total number of deaths. Since the overwhelming majority of SARS-CoV-2 cases are concentrated in a limited number of NYS regions, only counties reporting greater than 1000 confirmed cases on (4/20/2020) were included (Queens, Kings, Nassau, Bronx, Suffolk, Westchester, Manhattan, Rockland, Richmond, Orange, Dutchess, Erie, and Monroe). To estimate population density of the affected NYS counties, population and land area estimates were obtained from the United States Census Bureau [33]. Non-SARS-CoV-2 human coronavirus (HCoV) viral testing data was obtained from the CDC National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NRVESS) [37]. Data were extracted from two databases: viral testing data from 2014-2017 and 2018-2020 [38, 39]. To estimate the incidence of the HCoVs, the weekly percentage of positive tests were multiplied by the weekly population-weighted proportion of physician visits due to influenza-like illness (ILI) reported by the US Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) [38].

Recent studies including retrospective analyses, in vitro experiments, and epidemiological models suggest there may be a component of weather-based variability; however, this may be significantly less other respiratory viruses [42-48]. Based on these studies, the seasonal variability of SARS-CoV-2 (c(t)) was generated by conservatively weighting the generalized annual model of HCoV seasonal variability by a factor of 0.2. Undocumented infections represent an increasingly important factor in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. From serological studies, an undocumented rate of 75% was estimated by dividing the total number of confirmed cases by the product of the percent of serologically positive individuals and the population of the most affected NYS counties (see Methods, Data), subtracted from one",

The specific point of interest in this research is on predictive, preventive and personalised interoperable digital healthcare solutions. This point is supported by failures from the past, where the separate design of digital health solutions, has led to lack of interoperability. Hence, this review paper investigates the integration of predictive, preventive and personalised interoperable digital healthcare systems. The second point of interest is the use of new mass surveillance technologies to feed personal data from health professionals to governments, without any comprehensive studies that determine if such new technologies and data policies would address the pandemic crisis.",

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, these proved successful in some countries including Taiwan, South Korea, and China. Western countries are developing similar monitoring and surveillance approaches, hoping to replicate that success and prevent significant damage from rising risks of a second wave. With monitoring as the main drive, we could be limiting the potential for pandemic management. Designing separate systems in isolation could lead to the realisation that such systems are coupled by default. But by being designed in isolation, such systems become proprietary and not interoperable with similar systems built by others. This can also result in the repeat of past cybersecurity mistakes. We investigate interoperability in predictive, preventive and personalised medical systems design, which could become the topic of concern when upgrading the same systems we are building today, for pandemic management at the latter stages of this outbreak or future outbreaks.",

Within 6 weeks it became a pandemic, and by mid-March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had generated 24 times more cases than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak [1] . One of the differences is that the amount of digital data produced in the time period prior to and during SARS in 2003, is produced within minutes today in 2020 [1] . Big data has enabled geospatial mapping of COVID-19 for epidemic transition analysis, but challenges remain in 'data aggregation, knowledge discovery, and dynamic expression' [2] . There is also an opinion that many countries didn't learn from the previous two coronavirus pandemics (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome -MERS, and SARS), resulting in an inadequate risk assessment of the urgency, and the speed of the pandemic [3] . Taiwan on the other hand has learned from the SARS pandemic and has developed a fast response health mechanism, that recognised the crisis and activated emergency measures to contain the outbreak [4] .",

IoT is commonly used to describe various smart objects and things, with computational abilities, that exchange information, potentially even on a global level, perceiving the world as one adaptive and interconnected system [5] . This communication and exchange of information is done via different protocols including WAN, LAN/LoRaWAN, Bluetooth, Z-Wave, INSTEON, ZigBee, WiFi, 4G, and 5G. When social networks are integrated with the IoT a new concept emerges, named Social Internet of Things (SIoT). The SIoT potential architecture, policy and network structure has already been tested with simulations [6] . These simulations show that SIoT depends on the type of relationship (e.g.) Ownership object relationship (OOR); Social object relationship (SOR); Co-work object relationship (C-WOR); Co-location object relationship (C-LOR); and Dynamic Social Structure of Things (DSSoT). The 'Social Collaborative Internet of Things' (SCIoT) goes even further in respect that social objects are grouped and collaborate by interacting and sharing [7] , in other words, working as cognitive coupled systems. These concepts emerge as values in the advancements of smart healthcare monitoring and management systems that are using big data analytics, such as iHealth, and m-Health [8] . The diversity of SIoT implementations points to problems of scale and interoperability in terms of aggregation of data for responding to a pandemic.",

To forecast events, digital technologies currently use artificial intelligence (AI) to process large amounts of data. However, AI applications require narrowly defined use cases and large training datasets to 'teach' the app how to forecast. This would result in a slow adaptability of AI to managing a new and fast changing pandemic. To use AI in pandemic management, social machines and connected devices will require a different approach to AI training, for example, selective repurposing of AI systems already trained for other uses, like temperature measurement. A social machine is defined as 'an environment comprising humans and technology interacting and producing outputs or action which would not be possible without both parties present' 1 .",

To achieve the targets of the UK's digital contact tracing programme, for instance, it was anticipated that a minimum adoption rate of 60 percent 2 of the UK population was needed 3 . However, where such apps require the capture and sharing of sensitive data with various entities such as the government, potential users can become wary and reluctant to participate. One study found that over 70 percent citizens were unwilling to download contact tracing apps 4 . Since this data is already shared by many humans on social media and mobile apps, this opens up questions on how to design a privacy preserving contact tracing app, that ensures that a sufficient percentage of humans will download the pandemic management app. To investigate this, we refer to social science methods and relate the concept of social machines, with digital health, and pandemic management. An additional approach is to use standard Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to gather data that is available in the public domain 5 . This includes searches to public repositories of Internet-exposed and vulnerable IoT devices (for instance, shodan.io).",

Such human-machine interactions could provide valuable feedback for pandemic monitoring apps. The social networks described in Table 1 have large numbers of participants and can provide answers to complex problems [6] . Hence, when designing pandemic monitoring apps, we should focus on the value of this human-computer interaction for large numbers of participants and a wide range of devices. An approach to managing new mass surveillance technology that links personal data would be to enable the consolidation of connected devices into virtual objects for remote access and control. This could create a dynamic virtual network connecting different domains and facilitating sharing of resources in a cloud environment [18] . This would allow us to initiate the development of a truly global response and monitoring of pandemics.",

Use of these could enhance the privacy of digital heath solutions. SIoT is in the same risk category. SIoT objects can anonymously establish communications and cooperate opportunistically with neighbouring IoT devices, but trust management in SIoT is a concern [7] . Therefore, existing performance metrics for security operations analysis [40] , and failsafe recommendations [41] should be consulted in the design of digital heath solutions.",

We designed the diagram in Figure 1 , with data from this study, using the 'draw.io' open access web software 8 .The different lines represent the spread of COVID-19 regionally, nationally, and internationally, leading to a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally (demonstrated conceptually in Figure 1 , without reliance on concrete data) even before most governments realised the need to act, for example, at the time of writing the first known case in France was in December 2019, almost a month before the French government announced the first case in France 9 . Therefore, studying regional approaches in detail at this stage, when we don't truly understand the data, would probably not produce the results that we require. Instead, focus was placed on the regions that performed best during the initial outbreak, with the objective to gather and accumulate knowledge on the effectiveness of different methods, and with the aim of making recommendations for replicating this success in the second wave.",

This approach supported proactive behaviour, where people who were concerned about being exposed had a tool to determine if they should self-isolate prior to developing symptoms. The authorities also had a tool to monitor people in self-isolation with a mobile phone based 'electronic fence' that traces mobile phone signals to track location and follow up with two phone calls every day to make sure people stay home. The Taiwanese system sends alerts to police if selfquarantined people leave their home, and the police would contact or visit the person within 15 min of the alarm being triggered.

The community data enabled more targeted responses that have proven more effective than in all other economies, including the US, the EU and China, at least in the first wave. The case of Taiwan has proven that social inputs and coordination can prove more effective in resolving complex fast evolving problems, than centrally run top down approaches that take a while to deliver and, in some regions, lack buy in by the population.

However, it's worth mentioning that AI and ML can also add value in purely digital approaches to solving problems. AI/ML applications generally work best with narrowly defined use cases accompanied by large, hand-built training datasets to 'teach' an application how to execute against its use case. This results in slow adaptability of AI/ML to new opportunities, unless an existing capability can be re-purposed. For example, consider the Kogniz Health product 11 -a stand-alone infra-red digital camera with an integrated ML trained to identify passers-by who show signs of fever, and send alerts in real time via a variety of standard messaging tools. The ML capability is possibly repurposed from an existing ML use case to monitor and alert on temperature variations beyond acceptable limits in an industrial setting. This approach could work in advanced economies because of partially existing infrastructure, strong know how and technological/financial strength. But it is difficult to see how these tools can be made operational in developing countries, at the required speed.",

Currently IoT enabled drones are used for public surveillance, enforcing quarantines and even for faster disinfecting with agricultural drones. IoT can be used for enforcing compliance of infected people in quarantine, by monitoring and tracing potential infections caused by breach in quarantine. The speed and scale of IoT connectivity could enhance the UK's National Health Service (NHS) ability to monitor high-risk patients in home quarantine. This is currently done with healthcare workers going door-to-door, posing a risk to them, and using up resources for home checks that could turn out to be unnecessary. IoT real-time live cameras could be used for patient checks, cloud databases could be used for patients to upload their temperature measured on home thermometer and drones could be used to check temperature with infrared cameras. The aggregated IoT mobile data from infected patients can be used for tracing people who might have been in contact with infected patients. The IoT is already used for remote monitoring of in-house patients with serious conditions. Self-reporting apps such as the 'C-19 COVID symptom tracker' enable quick build-up of maps and other data that support people to prevent infection and medical professionals to plan their response. One of the main benefits from app design that operates as a social machine is the speed of deployment and data collection. For example, the UK 'Covid Symptom Tracker' app reached 700,000 downloads and app registrations in 24 hours [46] . It is almost impossible to gather such large data sets with any of the traditional data collection tools. But societal participation in data collection, during times of crises, seems to be producing relevant data at a very fast rate.",

To compare the three-fields plot analysis with alternative mapping of scientific research on COVID-19, we designed a graph by corresponding author countries Figure 3 . To compare these results, with the entire 2,254 records on the Web of Science Core Collection, we used the Web of Science result analysis tool and found similar results as seen in Figure 4 . Although in Figure 2 , and Figure 3 , China is shown as the dominating country in the scientific research on COVID-19, we compared the three-fields plot analysis, by using the same data file of records and designed a collaboration network as a social structure Figure 5 . What is clear from Figure 5 is that the UK is performing strongest in collaborative research on COVID-19, and this collaboration is strongly represented between the UK, US and Canada. We continued this analysis by doing a historical search on the Web of Science Core Collection for scientific research on global pandemics. This resulted with 3,708 records, and we used the Web of Science tool for research analysis -see Figure 6 . The historic analysis showed that countries that have led the scientific research on global pandemics in the past, are not represented as strongly as China in the scientific research on COVID-19. Since China was first affected in this global pandemic, we could speculate that regional research effort is driven by the effect of the pandemic. It is possible that other countries would pick up and start producing more scientific research, but such comparison can only be confirmed when data becomes available. At present, these graphs represent statistical analysis of the current data, as a snapshot in time, compared with historical analysis in Figure 6 . ",

Complementing such paradigms, smart cities generate vast amounts of data, captured and stored in different heterogenous formats, that need to be transformed to be of analytical value [53] . IoT and big data analytics are emerging trends in new biomedical and healthcare technologies [54] . These various different types of data need to be integrated to ensure fast and effective response during pandemic management. Although there are concerns about data privacy, there are many types of data that are already shared openly in different community settings (e.g. skill set, goods sold, vehicles movement, etc). Some personal data needs to be evaluated with specific privacy requirements in consideration, but there is also a lot of data shared in open community marketplaces [55] .",

We reviewed all five publications and only one actually discussed big data solutions. This one publication is only a viewpoint, not a research article. A similar search on 'pandemics and big data', using historical records since 1900 (to 2020) produced only 59 records. On the other hand, search results on 'big data' alone, produced 88,410 records. It is unclear if this result is caused by lack of funding, or lack of interest in the past on this research topic.

There seems to be a consensus among governments about the benefits of such mobile apps.

In Figure 7 , these tools and measures are integrated, to design a more comprehensive data collection and migration, for epidemic monitoring of regional risk trends, and indices of high-risk people or areas. We designed this diagram with data from this study, using the 'draw.io' open access web software 19 . Although these digital solutions are already operational and can easily be adopted for pandemic management, without proper planning significant challenges could emerge. Some challenges could relate to capturing duplicate data, hence adding significant workload on medical workers that collect, manage and use the data. The design of these digital health solutions separately could lead to lack of interoperability when their integration is crucial for making evidence-based decisions. Individual design could also lead to complexity, for example, hindering the ability of medical professionals to use digital health systems.

A patients' information sharing marketplace could prevent information blocking, and if cyber-attack results in information blocking, permissioned blockchains would present two unique advantages. Firstly, anyone in the medical consortium could check how and when information and transactions are happening. Secondly, blocking the information would change the hash on which the unique ID is based. Considering the above, the advantages for digital health systems are that patients can transmit personal records without the risk of tampering because blockchains are immutable and traceable.

In the review paper, we identified a plethora of tried and tested non-contact predictive, preventive and personalised digital healthcare concepts (e.g. mHealth, virtual clinics), that could help with controlling and preventing future pandemics. Mass surveillance linking personal data from health professionals, should not be collected and used by governments, but to the non-contact digital health technologies. The surveillance approach promoted by tech companies, where data is processed on individual devices and only anonymised data is shared with approval of the device owner, seems safer than some proposals for creating national databases. The concerns that big tech companies would abuse our personal data are in some cases exaggerated. Such personal data is already stored in our mobile devices and shared on social media sites, in mobile health apps, wearable devices, or with our GP surgeries, in compliance with current data privacy regulations. Hence, focus should be placed on secure integration of this data, which is already shared, for the purposes of COVID-19 and future pandemics detection, monitoring and management.

This could be an opportunity for governments to enable tech companies to learn from the COVID-19 and develop predictive, preventive and personalised tools that could prevent or minimise the effect of future pandemics.

Most of the required predictive, preventive and personalised technologies (e.g. mobile phones, mobile apps, low cost connected devices (IoT), and internet connection), are present in developing counties. But the abilities of some developing countries to develop regional predictive, preventive and personalised pandemic monitoring systems are questionable.

Then, a historic search parameter was used to identify methods applied in research on previous pandemics.From the first search result, we searched for 'COVID-19' and out of 2,264 records, we used the Web of Science filter and downloaded the most relevant 500 records.

In some case, only a single record. It is unclear if this result is caused by lack of funding, or lack of interest in the past on this research topic. Although we used all data records from the Web of Science Core Collection, there could be gaps in the data we are using. It could be too soon for publications with COVID-19 to have been published-and we should compare how different will it be in a year's time. We plan to rerun these queries again to see how the results have changes. In future studies we should be focused on publication times, and if a vaccine is identified in the next few months or years, we should investigate how many papers have been published, comparable to the increase in Covid-19 activity. Future studies should also look at other factors of the virus in literature.",

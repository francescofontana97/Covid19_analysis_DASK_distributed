Many countries have implemented mandatory requirements for wearing face masks in public. The use of face masks by general populations can reduce the spread of COVID-19, but it also causes severe problems for the environment. It is estimated that the daily face mask use in Africa is more than seven hundred million, while this number is more than 2.2 billion in Asia every day (Nzediegwu and Chang, 2020; Rowan and Laffey, 2020; Sangkham, 2020) . To the best knowledge of the authors, there is no up to date statistics of the daily number of face mask use around the world; however, it was estimated in June 2020 that monthly, 129 billion face masks were discharged into the environment . These numbers come back to the dates before the mandatory face mask policies enforced in several countries around the world. Thus, it is anticipated that currently, the global use of face masks is more than 129 billion every month due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the model of the daily global face mask proposed by Nzediegwu and Chang (2020) , the authors estimate that 6.88 billion (approximately 206,470 t) face masks are generated around the world each day, which are ultimately sent to landfills or incinerated.",

Even if the masks are thrown in trash bins or sit in landfill sites, due to the lightweight nature of the masks, wind and rainwater can move the masks freely into city streets or rivers and oceans, where the plastic-based masks can be fragmented into microplastics. Thus, throwing away the masks or improper waste management of the used personal protective equipment can end up causing problems for wildlife or killing animals and marine life (Fadare and Okoffo, 2020; Hirsh, 2020; Prata et al., 2020) . Furthermore, the single-use masks are made of non-biodegradable plastics, which means that they take hundreds of years to break down in the environment (Dhawan et al., 2019) . Therefore, multidisciplinary collaboration is urgently required to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the environmental risks associated with the disposal of used PPE.",

Consequently, large amounts of natural resources are being used in civil engineering. Besides, the extraction of virgin materials results in large quantities of greenhouse gas emissions (Saberian et al., 2019a) . Moreover, the construction sector, compared to the other waste generators, is responsible for the generation of significant amounts of waste materials (i.e. almost about half of the global generated wastes), which are mainly produced by demolishing buildings and other infrastructure projects (AzariJafari et al., 2016; Saberian and Li, 2019; Kazemi et al., 2020; Hajforoush et al., 2019) . Fortunately, to alleviate the negative environmental impact caused by the wastes, the possibility of recycling and reusing construction and demolition waste in civil engineering projects has significantly surged (Li et al., 2018a; Lei et al., 2018) . Construction and demolition waste comprises a wide variety of materials including recycled concrete aggregate, reclaimed asphalt pavement, crushed brick, crushed glass and crushed rock. Among these, concrete waste is produced from the construction and demolition activities of concrete structures (Saberian et al., 2019d) . The concrete waste constitutes a significant proportion of the construction and demolition wastes at about 45%. Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is obtained from crushing the concrete chunks into aggregates. The 20 mm nominal size of RCA is generally used in pavement applications (Saberian et al., 2020b) .",

This research proposes an innovative way to reduce pandemic-generated waste by recycling and reusing the shredded face mask (SFM) and mixing with recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) for pavement constructions. For the first time, a series of experiments, including modified compaction test, unconfined compression strength test and resilient modulus test, was performed to evaluate the feasibility of using SFM with RCA as road pavement materials. The outcomes of this study can provide practical guidance on the application of SFM and RCA.",

Compared to the control sample (i.e., 0% SFM), the UCS value of 99RCA1SFM (1% SFM) increased by 17% (from 185 to 216 kPa).

A similar trend was observed in previous studies on the strength properties of polypropylene-reinforced clay soils (Zaimoglu, 2010; Tomar et al., 2020) . The potential effects of short plastic fibers with low aspect ratio on the compressive strength of clay soil were also evaluated by Mishra and Gupta (2018) . Fig. 2 shows that an addition of 1% SFM provided the highest UCS value (216 kPa). As the SFM was increased to 2% and 3%, the UCS of the blends reduced to 204 kPa and 178 kPa, respectively, indicating that there is a threshold value of SFM content beyond which the UCS reduced. Therefore, although an introduction of the SFM improved the integrity and strength of the RCA, increasing the SFM content would lead to decreasing UCS because the excessive fiber inclusion would result in the loss of stiffness of the blended sample due to high amount of voids. This is consistent with previous studies on the polypropylene-reinforced clay soil (Chen et al., 2015) . Also, it can be stated that with the SFM content beyond 2%, the quantity of RCA matrix available for holding the fiber is insufficient to develop an effective bond between fibers and the RCA resulting in balling of fibers and poor mixing. A similar observation was also made by Pradhan et al. (2012) on the effect of random inclusion of polypropylene fibers on strength characteristics of cohesive clay soil. They reported that the inclusion of more than 1% of the fibers to the soil led to some difficulties in the soil compaction since the fibers stuck together and formed lumps, which caused pockets of low density.",

            "text": "Furthermore, Fig. 3 shows the bridge effect of the SFM in an underloaded situation of RCA sample along with the expansion and the deformation of the RCA. As can be seen, the SFM fibers played a reinforcing role in binding the RCA particles, and therefore, the bridging effect of the fibers in the RCA could obstruct the further development of tension cracks. Similar results on reinforced soils with polypropylene fibers were reported by Tomar et al. (2020) and Bojnourdi et al. (2020) . Fig. 2 shows the changes in the deformability of the samples as well. The flexibility of pavement layers is very important for flexible pavements (Saberian et al., 2019c) . The flexibility can be evaluated by Eq. (2), which formulates the deformability index (I D ) that is the ratio of the failure strain of a given sample incorporating an additive (\u03b5 f SFM ) to the failure strain of the control sample (\u03b5 f co ) (Jahandari et al., 2019) . According to the I D results, the inclusion of the SFM into the RCA led to increasing the deformability index. This can be related to the higher tensile strength of the SFM with more flexibility compared to the RCA particles. In fact, by the introduction of the SFM fibers to the RCA, the strain at the failure tends to happen at higher strain levels due to the mobilization of the tensile strength of the SFM fibers. This finding is in agreement with previous results of Correia et al. (2015) and Venda Oliveira et al. (2018) . , 1993; Saberian et al., 2019b) . It was found that the M r value was highly dependent on the axial cyclic stress and confining stress. Similar to the UCS results, the inclusion of 1% SFM to RCA provided the highest M r result at 314.35 MPa. In other words, the optimal SFM content was 1% by the dry weight of RCA. The increase in M r values can be attributed to the increased stretching resistance between RCA particles by the inclusion of short SFM fibers. Further increasing of the SFM content led to a decrease in M r , due to the high amount of voids and tangling of the excessive SFM fibers together in some parts of the samples that obstructed bonding between the fibers and RCA particles.",

Based on the results, it can be concluded that the test data demonstrated an excellent fit for both models. In fact, the accuracy of the predictions with both models is noticeably high (R 2 > 0.99). This implies that the existing models can also be used to predict or evaluate the resilient behaviour of RCA reinforced with SFM fibers. The methodology proposed in the current study would be restricted to pavements and not building materials. Although the research has reached its aims, there was a potential limitation.

(2020) conducted a comprehensive review of the disinfection technologies to control/prevent the novel coronavirus spread and the proper management of COVID-waste. Doan (2020) recommended the microwaved method for disinfecting disposable medical masks. In this method, an antiseptic solution (i.e., 0.9% physiological saline) must be sprayed on the masks to maintain the moisture. Then, the moist masks have to be heated in a microwave oven, having a default capacity of 800 W, for about 1 min. It is worth to mention that the sprayed sides of the masks have to be faced up. This sanitizing method can effectively kill 99.9% of viruses (Doan, 2020) . Xiang et al. (2020) reported that dry heat at both 60\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C for 1 h could ensure the decontamination of the surgical face mask while maintaining its filtering efficiency. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and hydrogen peroxide plasma can also be used for the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 from the masks (Barcelo, 2020; Hamzavi et al., 2020; Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez-Cervantes et al., 2020) . To eliminate the risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus during transportation and construction, it is suggested to keep face masks, after the disinfecting, in an open and restricted area, and exposed to sun and air for a week prior to pavement construction. Delivery trucks should be covered with tarps or a similar covering used to prevent dust. Trucks and road construction machinery need to be disinfected by using good hygiene practices and safe cleaning techniques. Since the main aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using SFM as a road pavement material, a comprehensive discussion on the disinfecting and sterilizing methods is beyond the scope of this paper.",

A feasibility study, similar to one reported in this paper, needs to be conducted to investigate the potential use of other waste PPE with recycled concrete aggregate as pavement base/subbase materials. For future works, it is also recommended to assess the feasibility of using non-plastic face masks as another sustainable option to mitigate pandemic-generated waste. ",

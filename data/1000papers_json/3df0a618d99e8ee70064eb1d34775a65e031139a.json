Our aims were to analyze epidemiological characteristics of infants with bronchiolitis over 10 consecutive seasons and to evaluate whether there are any clinical differences between infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis during epidemic peak months and infants in non-peak months. We enrolled consecutive enrolled 723 previously healthy term infants hospitalized at the Paediatric Emergency Department, \"Sapienza\" University of Rome over the period 2004-2014. Fourteen respiratory viruses were detected from nasopharyngeal aspirates by molecular methods. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from clinical charts. Viruses were detected in 351 infants (48.5%): RSV in 234 (32.4%), RV in 44 (6.1%), hBoV in 11 (1.5%), hMPV in 12 (1.6%), co-infections in 39 (5.4%), and other viruses in 11 (1.5%). Analyzing the 10 epidemic seasons, we found higher incidence for bronchiolitis every 4 years with a peak during the months December-January. Infants hospitalized during peak months had lower family history for asthma (P \u00bc 0.003), more smoking mothers during pregnancy (P \u00bc 0.036), were slightly higher breastfed (0.056), had lower number of blood eosinophils (P \u00bc 0.015) and had a higher clinical severity score (P \u00bc 0.017). RSV was detected mostly during peak months, while RV was equally distributed during the seasons. We found some variations in bronchiolitis incidence during epidemics, and discriminative characteristics in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis during peak months and in non-peak months, that might reflect two different populations of children.",

It is well known that the number of infants with bronchiolitis rapidly increases from the beginning of the epidemic, it reaches a peak with a plateau during the 2-3 central months and then rapidly decreases during the last months. The identification of a virus is higher during the peak months of the epidemic and it is lower at the beginning and at the end, but it is not clear whether patients who have bronchiolitis during the peak months have different demographic and clinical characteristics, comparing to those who have bronchiolitis during the non-peak months. 1,2 Furthermore, it has been shown that also the number of patients with bronchiolitis may change from 1 year to the other probably due to viruses' characteristics and the immunological status of the patients. 3 Because of the conflict that exists in the definition, a more homogenous material, following strict inclusion criteria are needed.",

The peak of hospitalization for bronchiolitis tended to come early to January and showed an increase of cases every 4 years. RSV was confirmed as the most common agent of bronchiolitis, followed by RV, hBoV, and hMPV; coinfections have been detected in 5.4% of children. In our study, we confirmed that RSV infection was present in younger and more clinically severe infants, while infants with RV had higher number of blood eosinophils. Finally, differences in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics have been found between infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis during the peak months and ones during non-peak months.",

Otherwise, the American Pediatric Academy defines bronchiolitis as the first episode of acute viral wheeze occurring in infants less than 2 years. 1 In order to exclude infants with virus associated episodes of wheezing, having wheezing alone was not considered sufficient for inclusion in the study. 10 Comparing hospitalization for bronchiolitis during different years, we found a peak of incidence in the 3rd and 7th seasons in respect to the subsequent year indicating that respiratory virus circulation apparently increase every 4 years. Alternating circulation of RSV types A and B could explain different rates of hospitalization in different epidemic seasons, but unfortunately, as stated below as a study limitation, we did not test for viruses' subtypes along the whole study period. Moore et al. studied duration of immunity after RSV infection assuming the need of a sufficient number of infected people at the same time to gain population immunity also considering that immunity could wane several months before the onset of a subsequent RSV season. Differences in viral circulation during the years could be linked to the circulation of different viral genotypes or, than, to the \"herd immunity.\" 8, 13 In fact, the spread of a new RSV A subtype (ON1) has been recently demonstrated in Rome. 14 Our finding of an anticipation of the month with the higher incidence of bronchiolitis (December or January instead of March) could be linked to changes in climatic conditions, such as temperature or humidity, and to air pollution modification over different years. 15 This fact could influence viral spread along with predisposition of patients to respiratory infection.",

            "text": "Comparing bronchiolitis from different viruses in 10 consecutive seasons, we confirmed RSV as more severe agent affecting younger infants. Moreover, while RV was equally distributed during the year, most of RSV was detected during winter months, strongly correlating with bronchiolitis incidence trend, as other studies have already shown. 16 We think that this fact may be caused by climate factors, such as temperature, air pressure, and pollution modifications could modulate even the seasonality of viruses, as other studies already evidenced. 17, 18 In fact, the study by Herv as et al. concluded that the mean temperature and atmospheric pressure were the main factors for RSV activity. 18 Observing the distribution of bronchiolitis during the year, we were able to isolate peak and non-peak months of hospitalization for this disease with some differences between the two populations. An association between peak bronchiolitis, incidence, and clinical severity was found. It could be linked to our finding of higher incidence of RSV in peak months with respect to the non-peak months. Having both parents with asthma and the number of eosinophils were significantly lower during peak months. These facts may justify the different characteristics of this population hospitalized in a period with lower viruses detection and less severe viral infections. On the other hand, analyzing risk factors for respiratory diseases, infants exposed to maternal smoke during pregnancy were hospitalized more during peak months; this could be linked to modification of respiratory mucosa and subsequent predisposition to viral infection, in particular from RSV in at risk infants. Noakes et al. studied that smoke increases early susceptibility to infection and, then, the subsequent IgA responses. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Our study has some limitations. First, as we discussed in our previous article, 10 although the sensitive and comprehensive PCR method, our virus detection rate was poor. It could be partly due to technical problems related to collecting and storing samples. Otherwise, some of the virus negative cases may be related to undetected pathogens. Finally, we did not test for viruses subtypes.",

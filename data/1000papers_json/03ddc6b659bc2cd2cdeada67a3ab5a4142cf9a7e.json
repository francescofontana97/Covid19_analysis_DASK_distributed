The objective of this study was to describe and compare the psychological impacts of COVID-19 isolation and quarantine. Methods: This was a cross-sectional retrospective study. Participants were Bahrainis aged >18 years who had undergone either isolation or quarantine. Eligible participants were identified from the COVID-19 contacts (quarantine) and cases (isolation) database of Bahrain. Validated questionnaires for self-reported depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies -depression [CES-D]), posttraumatic stress (Impact of Event Scale -revised [IES-R]), and perceived stigma (Stigma Scale [SS]) were administered. Results: Mean CES-D, IES-R, and SS scores were 16.76\u00b15.65, 13.50\u00b114.67, and 25.29 \u00b17.99, respectively. In sum, 40% (205 of 502) of participants showed clinically significant depression, and <20% (98 of 502) had indications of some posttraumatic distress, with greater depression and distress in those isolated than those quarantined. Perceived stigma was reported by 53.4% (268 of 502) of participants, more prominent among those quarantined. Depression and posttraumatic stress scores were significantly higher in females, college students, those with a history of mental health conditions, knowing a COVID-19 fatality, and experiencing social conflict. Age was a significant variable correlated with all three scales, with younger participants indicating more distress, depression, and stigma. Duration of segregation was significantly correlated with CES-D, score showing more depressive symptoms as the duration of isolation increased. Significant predictors were age, sex, history of mental illness, and COVID-19 status. Conclusion: Isolated and quarantined individuals reported depression, perceived stigma, and to a lesser extent distress. Psychological interventions identifying and targeting people with different-severity psychological burdens are in urgent need.",

            "text": "On 30 January 30, 2020, the WHO director-general declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. To prevent the spread of the virus, individuals testing positive for the disease should be placed in isolation, (\"separation of ill or infected persons from others\"). 1 Discharge required clinical recovery with two negative sequential RT-PCR results within 24 hours, which was later updated to 10 days after symptom onset plus a minimum of 3 days without symptoms for symptomatic patients and 10 days after a positive test for asymptomatic patients. 2 In addition to isolation, quarantine (\"separation of persons who are not ill, but who may have been exposed to an infectious agent or disease\"), 1 measures were introduced. Individuals identified as contacts (eg, providing direct care without the use of personal protective equipment, having face-to face-contact within 1 m >15 minutes) of laboratory-confirmed cases required 14 days of quarantine from the last time they were exposed to the patient. 3 Although isolation and quarantine have distinct meanings in practice, they both involve the separation of an individual from their loved ones, normal activities, and routines for the purpose of infection prevention. The psychological impact of quarantine and isolation was exacerbated by the harmful effect of limited physical activity and changes in dietary practices. 4 Such changes may result in dramatic and long-lasting psychological impact. A study on quarantined and isolated individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 reported posttraumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. 5 In a study on health-care workers who had survived the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in Saudi Arabia in 2015, participants explained a variety of painful experiences of rejection and avoidance by their colleagues and neighbors postrecovery. 6 Similar avoidance was reported by SARS survivors, along with perceived barriers to service access and employment 7 and well beyond the initial outbreak. 8 Stigma, including being shunned, insulted, marginalized, and rejected in the domains of work, interpersonal relationships, use of services, and schooling was also reported. 9 In the context of the current pandemic, reports from China have showed rates of up to 30% for anxiety, 10 17% depression, 11 and 35% traumarelated distress symptoms. 12 Similar rates have also been reported in Italy following implementation of lockdown measures. 13 Furthermore, reports from India and Bangladesh have described suicidal behaviors (eg, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and actual suicide) for various reasons. 14, 15 In the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, the Bahraini containment strategy includes the rapid identification of laboratory-confirmed cases, isolation, and management. In parallel, comprehensive contact-tracing measures are conducted using the BeAware Bahrain app, which notifies individuals of close contact with suspected cases, facilitates COVID-19 testing, enables close vigilance of self-isolation/quarantine, and provides relevant and accurate information from a reputable source. 16 The containment strategy includes the International COVID-19 Repatriation Programme, with repatriates clinically segregated from the general population to complete quarantine and testing before being formally admitted to the country. 2 The objective of this study was to describe and compare the psychological effects of COVID-19 between those placed into isolation and those placed into quarantine.",

We used validated and translated tools to measure depression, distress, and perceived stigma associated with the pandemic. About 40% of participants showed clinically significant depression, with those isolated exhibiting greater depression than those quarantined. Less than 20% had indications of distress, with greater distress in those isolated than those quarantined. Distress and diagnosis of PTSD were also more pronounced in Table 3 Associations between demographics and scale scores (ANOVA and t-tests) DovePress participants that had undergone isolation. Perceived stigma was more prominent among those quarantined than those placed in isolation. This is higher than that reported among the general population in Bahrain during the pandemic, with about a third reporting depressive and stress symptoms, 26 but similar to ta study on the general population from Saudi Arabia, both studies utilizing a snowball social media-sampling technique. 27 Social stigma and discrimination have been described in detail in other infectious respiratory diseases, such as tuberculosis, SARS, and MERS-CoV. 28 Stigmatizing language, eg, \"tuberculosis suspect,\" has been criticized by activists, as well as \"COVID-19 suspect.\" 29 COVID-19 cases and close contacts have been compared to criminals. 29 Stigma toward those who have recovered from COVID-19, undergoing treatment, or presumed to be affected has been well described in the literature, especially in developing countries. 30 Although most reports have indicated that men with COVID-19 have a poorer prognosis, there is an increasing body of evidence to confirm that the psychological impact is more profound in women. 26, 27, 30, 31 This agrees with our results, which showed that females exhibited more psychological depression and distress. College students were the most affected among occupational categories in this study. Although the number of college students that participated in this study was low, this result is consistent with other studies reporting that the mental health of college students has been significantly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. 26, 27, 32, 33 Concerns of personal health, health of family members, and finance, particularly for those impacted by prolonged closure of employers, have been reported. 34 The added impact of quarantine has led to high occurrence of distress, depression, anxiety, stress, and even self-reported suicidal thoughts. 33 Loss of income, poor-quality housing, history of psychiatric follow-up, symptoms compatible with COVID-19, low levels of physical activity, not living with family, weak sense of integration, low quality of social relations, and receiving low-quality information were associated with all mental health issues. 33 Consistently with a recent systematic review, our findings suggested that people with preexisting mental conditions are at highest risk of psychological distress and should be targeted for psychological assessment and appropriate intervention. 31 Based on the results of this study and others, female college students with mental health conditions may be particularly vulnerable to psychological impact due to isolation and quarantine. Given the immediate and long-lasting effects, such groups must be the focus of psychological screening, intervention, and future research.",

It is evident from the literature that those with infectious disease have fears of infecting others during quarantine. 5 Fear of infecting others or becoming infected, potentially exacerbated by ignorance of infection transmission, may have resulted in avoidance within the home beyond required social distancing measures. Such experiences of avoidance from family members, as opposed to trained healthcare professionals, may have led to feelings of great hurt and shame, increasing the burden of stigma. Other contributing factors were losing one's job, experiencing social conflict or breakup, transmitting the infection to others, or knowing someone who had died due to the disease. Duration between isolation/quarantine and interview did not have a significant effect on psychological outcomes, which could reflect the longlasting effect of segregation. In one study, alcohol abuse and dependence symptoms were reported among quarantined individuals 3 years after the SARS outbreak. 35 ",

Further, this is one of the few studies in the region describing the psychological impact of COVID-19 for cases (isolated) and contacts (quarantined) at two times of segregation. However, this study is not without limitations. Due to the escalating nature of this pandemic, we were unable to compare psychological outcomes immediately after quarantine/isolation (baseline) and months later among the same cohort. Instead, we recruited two groups at two stages of segregation and compared outcomes. These selected periods might not be representative of the whole period. Another limitation was that we did not capture psychological effects related to travel for religious purposes, which was perceived as a threat in terms ofspreading the infection, ultimately resulting in government-led repatriation.",

In many cases, social media can operate as a crisis platform to generate community crisis maps [29] , [30] . There are four types of connection between the users of social media during a crisis: i) the authorities communicate with citizens (statements, information, instructions, etc.), ii) authorities communicate with other authorities for an inter-organizational crisis management, iii) citizens to citizens (photographs, information, communities) and iv) the citizens communicate with authorities [31] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 756, "end": 760, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 763, "end": 767, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1166, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "As was expected, social distancing due to Covid -19 resulted in an increase in social media use.

The reaction was impressive between the citizens, who used social media to tackle the shortage of PPE and to help the doctors and nurses during the pandemic. Worldwide, social media groups exchanged ideas, drawings, schematics and technical instructions, in order to produce face shields, reusable respirators, ventilators and other PPE [39] . One of the most important actions of social media users is the use of 3D printing technology to produce specific PPE. Social networks have the potential to combine both information from the official sources and popular information from citizens in a short period of time, making them a valuable tool in crisis management [40] . Previous studies show that in times of crisis, citizens seem to be more cooperative and better able to respond to authorities' instructions via social media [41] . The main advantage of using these tools, is the dynamic capability they provide to disseminate the information [42] . Unfortunately, the use of media has not only advantages, but also disadvantages, such as unreliability of the information, and inefficiency and dispersal of panic [12] , [43] . At the time of the Covid -19 pandemic, the network platform use rose by at least 20%, communicating information for the virus spread and for the shortages of PPE [44] . This information has motivated the global community to look for possible solutions to these problems.

In most cases, the largest percentage is due to the impact of social media users on news / blogs and WEB, due to the fact that social media groups display their products/results on news websites. Proof that the teams were organized through social media is that in the PPEs that can be printed (Face Shields, Respirator but also Valves and ventilators) show increased percentages on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, while in the rest they are zero. Although several designs have been developed for 3D printing, the biggest concern is whether all of them can be used. Some of these designs have been approved by NIH and FDA. Particular attention should be paid to the materials used for their production, but also to the way they are used so as not to endanger human lives. The American Society of Anesthesiologists made a statement about the possibility of having multiple patients per ventilator. Characteristically, they state a number of reasons why it is impossible to do so, for example, \"Volumes would go to the most compliant lung segments. Positive end expiratory pressure, which is of critical importance in these patients, would be impossible to manage.\" [47] . For such types of reasons, even after about three months from the beginning of the pandemic, licenses for the manufacture of respirators by individuals in the vast majority, have not been issued In figure 5 a proposed process used before 3D printing is illustrated. The need for PPE and medical supplies triggers the beginning of the process. Individuals are usually searching for designs and solutions for the problems concerning the local community through social media. Accordingly, they should verify whether the final product has been approved by the competent authorities. In case the proposed design lacks a license, a similar design that has the relevant license should be selected. Following, the prototype is printed and inspected from the local healthcare professionals for micro adjustment, if necessary. Finally, if all the previous steps are completed, the product can be printed in mass quantities. The QALY allows for the combined study of outcomes of any health-related actions and their effect on mortality into a single indicator, thus establishing a method that enables comparisons across multiple disease areas. Throughout their life, people have different health states, which are weighted based on the preassigned utility ranks. The QALY model was applied as shown in figure 4 , taking into account that one of the main reasons of viral infection affecting the respiratory system is the non-usage or poor application of protective equipment as well as the fact that health professionals are more exposed and subsequently .

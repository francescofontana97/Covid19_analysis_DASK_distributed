Drive-through delivery of healthcare was modeled in a training exercise as a safe and efficient mechanism to provide large populations access to testing during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [2] . During the current pandemic, drive-through screening has processed large volumes of patients more efficiently than conventional in-clinic assessment, while reducing potential healthcare exposures and personal protective equipment (PPE) use [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, there are limited data regarding patient characteristics or outcomes in the drive-through setting [8] [9] [10] [11] 15] . Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) (San Antonio, TX) implemented drivethrough screening for SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020. We describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of screened individuals and report test turnaround time and hospital admissions as safety-outcome measures.",

            "text": "A potential risk of drive-through screening is that patients who would otherwise require further medical evaluation due to complex or concerning presentations could be missed due to anchoring on the presence or absence of indications for SARS-CoV-2 testing. In our analysis, <1% of patients screened were dispositioned to the ED, and approximately 1% of patients screened required hospitalization within 14 days, although we did not capture admissions to outside facilities. Our proportion of cases hospitalized (4.3%) was similar to that seen in a Seattle drive-through for healthcare workers (3.2%) [15] . Nonetheless, the median time from screening to admission suggests that some patients requiring additional medical evaluation may have reported to the drive-through. Positioning the drive-through in close proximity to the ED [2, 4, 5] and having provider oversight may have mitigated risk for our program. Recognizing the need to mitigate risk, the Mayo Clinic has incorporated (1) telehealth follow-up for confirmed cases and (2) an in-person clinic for those with respiratory symptoms who tested negative but needed further evaluation [8, 9] ; by contrast, a drivethrough program in Malaysia transported all confirmed cases to their hospital via ambulance [13] . The use of an algorithm to identify more seriously ill patients and linkage to primarycare and/or emergency follow-up are essential elements of a drive-through program. Reflective of active-duty military, our analysis had a high proportion of young and healthy patients. Drive-through platforms drawing older patients and/or those with more comorbidities may require an even greater emphasis on triage to follow-up or immediate care.",

This significantly delayed contact tracing, which is critical in mitigating COVID-19 [16] . Current guidance for outpatient testing states that SARS-CoV-2 results should return within 48 hours of collection to inform decision making at the individual-patient and public health levels [1] . Other drive-through centers have reported a 24-to 72-hour turnaround time [9, [12] [13] [14] . Because access to testing with a relatively quick turnaround is important to optimize drive-through effectiveness, BAMC eliminated outsourced testing after the analysis period and added a rapid SARS-CoV-2 assay. An additional limitation was that some patients who had symptoms recorded by questionnaire were not tested. Although specific reasons were not captured, this may have been due to variability in self-reporting of symptom severity [17] , additional clarification after provider review (eg, chronic or resolved symptoms), or ineligibility for testing due to lack of militarybeneficiary status. However, none of the screen-only patients later tested positive or were hospitalized for COVID-19 within 14 days. Although our testing protocol focused on symptomatic patients, a universal-testing program in South Korea found that 2.6% of asymptomatic patients without a history of close contact tested positive [11] . Broader testing criteria to include asymptomatic individuals can be considered if resources allow to inform medical or public health decision making [1] .",

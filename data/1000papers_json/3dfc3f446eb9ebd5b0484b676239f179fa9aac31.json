For many people, social distancing can translate into social isolation, when they are prevented from travelling, physical meetings with friends and social activities, in some cases even from leaving their home other than for essential activities. Social isolation is a wide term without a consistent definition in the literature. Three indicators of social isolation are commonly used in research: low number of social contacts, loneliness and living alone. 1 The number of social contacts is a behavioral measure that can -at least in theory -be objectively quantified.",

For weighing up this potential impact in policy decisions, the existing evidence needs to be considered. Against this background, we conducted a systematic umbrella review to synthesize the evidence on the association between social isolation and physical and mental health outcomes.",

Items addressing the following criteria were considered as critical: Clear research question including definitions of population, intervention, control group, and outcomes (PICO), adequacy of the literature search, and adequate assessment and/or consideration of risk of bias in the primary studies. Typically, high and moderate ratings reflect the presence of one or more non-critical weakness, while low and critically low ratings indicate one or more critical weaknesses. Any discrepancies among the independent raters were discussed until consensus was reached. Table 1 . living alone as an objective characteristic of the living situation. The meta-analyses differed with respect to whether they kept these three measures of social isolation separate of whether they combined them (see Tab. 1).

The reported results in Table 1 were based on sample sizes ranging from 1,451 11 to 113,374 12 participants, with three meta-analyses not reporting on the sample size. Four meta-analyses were based on longitudinal studies only, one on cross-sectional studies only, and the remaining five on a combination of both crosssectional and longitudinal studies. Only one of these studies was conducted with children and adolescents. 13 The meta-analyses revealed that there is a significant association between social isolation and the following health problems: chronic physical complaints in children and adolescents, 13 cardiovascular disease, 14 coronary heart disease and stroke, 15 and frailty in older male (but not female) adults. 12 Additionally, social isolation was associated with early mortality, 7,16 malnutrition, 17 hospital readmission in heart failure patients, 18 and vaccine uptake amongst older adults. 19 One meta-analysis 11 reported mostly non-significant results on a positive 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y 14 association between social isolation and inflammation (acute-phase C-reactive protein and fibrinogen).",

Secondly, half of the included meta-analyses for both physical and mental health outcomes had an overall quality rated on AMSTAR-2 as low or critically low, with inadequate consideration of risk of bias being the most frequent critical flaw. Thirdly, the quality of the primary research studies that went into the included meta-analyses also varied and their different have an even greater impact on health outcomes than has been suggested in this review. Arguably, an even greater impact can be expected for certain risk groups, such as older people who are more threatened by COVID-19 and socially disadvantaged groups who often face even more economic adversity than before the pandemic. Further research is required to identify which populations are at particular risk to suffer health problems as a result of social distancing and to explore whether the resulting social isolation may -at least to some extent and in some people -be compensated through positive effects of the pandemic, such as strengthened local communities and increased options for online social activities. 40 ",

            "text": "Three indicators of social isolation (also referred to as social connections) are commonly used in research: few social network ties, living alone, and loneliness. [2] [3] [4] Social network ties is a behavioral measure that can -at least in theory -be objectively quantified. Living alone describes a basic characteristic of an individual's social situation which can be associated with reduced social relationships, but is not necessarily so. 5 Loneliness, on the other hand, is an individual's subjective assessment of the quality and quantity of their social relationships, reflecting a belief that they have too few or too poor relationships, or both. Accordingly, social network ties and living alone represent structural indicators, whereas loneliness represents a quality measure of social connections. 4, 5 Although these three indicators capture distinct aspects of social isolation, they commonly overlap and are associated with each other. Literature suggests that many individuals are socially isolated or lonely or both and that social isolation and loneliness may occur unequally across age groups. For example, Hawkley and colleagues 6 reported that loneliness decreased with age through the early 70s and then increased again. Several studies indicate that at least a fifth of adults report frequent 7, 8 and that more than 40 percent of adults aged 60 and older report feeling lonely. 9 The extent to which individuals are socially isolated can have a profound impact on both physical and psychological well-being. 5 Social isolation is thought to influence health through behavioral and biological pathways. 10 Several studies demonstrate that social isolation is associated with health-relevant behaviors, such as lack of physical activity, poorer sleep, obsessive behavior, as well as neuroendocrine dysregulation, 10 chronic allostatic load, 11 high blood pressure and poor immune functioning. 5, 12, 13 Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect of social isolation on mortality may be equivalent to or exceed the impacts of deleterious behaviors such as excessive drinking or obesity. 3 Physical distancing may increase social isolation therefore have a negative impact on physical and mental health. For weighing up this potential impact in policy decisions, the existing evidence needs to be considered. Against this background, we conducted a systematic umbrella review to synthesize the evidence on the association between social isolation and physical and mental health outcomes. As recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), we explored relevant meta-analyses by means of a rapid review of evidence. 14",

Items addressing the following criteria were considered as critical: Clear research question including definitions of population, intervention, control group, and outcomes (PICO), adequacy of the literature search, and adequate assessment and/or consideration of risk of bias in the primary studies. Typically, high and moderate ratings reflect the presence of one or more non-critical weakness, while low and critically low ratings indicate one or more critical weaknesses.

Living alone describes a basic characteristic of an individual's social situation which can be associated with reduced social relationships, but is not necessarily so. 2 Loneliness, on the other hand, is an individual's subjective assessment of the quality and quantity of their social relationships, reflecting a belief that they have too few or too poor relationships, or both. Accordingly, social isolation and living alone represent structural indicators, whereas loneliness represents a quality measure of social connections. 5, 2 Although these three indicators capture distinct aspects of social connection, they commonly overlap and are associated with each other. Literature suggests that many individuals are socially isolated or lonely or both and that social isolation and loneliness may occur unequally across age groups. For example, Hawkley and colleagues 6 reported that loneliness decreased with age through the early 70s and then increased again. Several studies indicate that at least a fifth of adults report frequent loneliness, 7, 8 and that more than 40 percent of adults aged 60 and older report feeling lonely. 9 The extent to which individuals are socially isolated can have a profound impact on both physical and psychological well-being. 2 Social connection is thought to influence health through behavioral and biological pathways. 10 Several studies demonstrate that social connection is associated with health-relevant behaviors, such as lack of physical activity, poorer sleep, obsessive behavior, as well as neuroendocrine dysregulation, 10 chronic allostatic load, 11 high blood pressure and poor immune functioning. 2, 12, 13 Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect of social connection on mortality may be equivalent to or exceed the impacts of deleterious behaviors such as excessive drinking or obesity. 4 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   6 Physical distancing may increase lack of social connection and therefore have a negative impact on physical and mental health. For weighing up this potential impact in policy decisions, the existing evidence needs to be considered. Against this background, we conducted a systematic umbrella review to synthesize the evidence on the association between social connection and physical and mental health outcomes. As recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), we explored relevant meta-analyses by means of a rapid review of evidence. 14",

It can include a full lock down and curfew, specific guidelines for meetings and gatherings of people, physical distancing in public, and a recommended or mandatory wearing of face masks. The type, degree, and duration of physical One can only speculate as to whether and, if so, to what extent the increased lack of social connections resulting from physical distancing measures in the current situation will have an even greater impact on health outcomes than has been suggested in this review. Arguably, an even greater impact can be expected for certain risk groups, such as socially disadvantaged groups (e.g., individuals in need of mental or physical health care or individuals with low income) who often face even more economic adversity than before the pandemic. Further research is required to identify which populations are at particular risk to suffer health problems as a result of physical distancing and to explore whether the resulting lack of social connections may -at least to some extent and in some people -be compensated through positive effects of the pandemic, such as strengthened local communities and increased options for online social activities. 47, 50 Conclusions",

The existing literature suggests that social isolation and loneliness may affect both physical and mental health outcomes and include an excess mortality. However, the potential impact of physical distancing on social isolation and loneliness and ultimately on physical and mental health outcomes need to be thoroughly examined. In addition, the existing knowledge on the association between social connection and physical and mental health should be considered in clinical practice.

Further research is required to identify which populations are at particular risk to suffer health problems as a result of physical distancing and to explore whether the resulting social isolation may -at least to some extent and in some people -be compensated through positive effects of the pandemic, such as strengthened local communities and increased options for online social activities.47,50 ConclusionsIn governmental decisions about future physical distancing measures, a potential negative impact of the resulting physical isolation on the health of the population needs to be considered. The existing literature suggests that social isolation and loneliness may affect both physical and mental health outcomes and include an excess mortality. However, the potential impact of physical distancing on social isolation and loneliness and ultimately on physical and mental health outcomes need to be thoroughly examined. In addition, the existing knowledge on the association between social connection and physical and mental health should be considered in clinical practice.

Physical distancing as part of measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 is different from the situations considered in the research synthesized in this review. Firstly, for the vast majority of the population, the required physical distancing leads to a much more pronounced lack of social connection than what they have experienced before. Secondly, physical distancing is externally imposed and not due to individual life style decisions, lack of material means, poor social skills or other barriers to socialize. And thirdly, physical distancing is requested from people in an overall context of uncertainty that comes with further stressors, health risks, and often a reduced accessibility of health care.",

Accordingly, we should not assume that physical distancing inevitably leads to social isolation and For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml loneliness. However, physical distancing is likely to have a disproportionate effect on those most vulnerable, in particular older adults, individuals in need of intensive physical or mental health care, and individuals with limited access to technology who lack the means of engaging in creative forms of contact with loved ones. Older patients, for example, may lose access to important parts of their usual routine (e.g., day care programs or informal gatherings with significant others).

Existing volunteer friendly visiting programs or psychosocial group interventions 48 may need to be redesigned to the point that they can be readily implemented in in accordance with existing rules of physical distancing. Creative All the included studies assessed social isolation as it occurs in a normal societal context. Physical distancing as part of measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 is different from the situations considered in the research synthesized in this review. Firstly, for the vast majority of the population, the required physical distancing leads to a much more pronounced social isolation than what they have experienced before. Secondly, physical distancing is externally imposed and not due to individual life style decisions, lack of material means, poor social skills or other barriers to socialize. And thirdly, physical distancing is requested from people in an overall context of uncertainty that comes with further stressors, health risks, and often a reduced accessibility of health care.It is important to note that physical distancing is a broad umbrella term that incorporates a wide range of potential measures, with highly divergent implications for social routines. It can include a full lock down and curfew, specific guidelines for meetings and gatherings of people, physical distancing in public, and a recommended or mandatory wearing of face masks. The type, degree, and duration of physical distancing measures have been variable across countries and will affect how isolated different groups in the population become.One can only speculate as to whether and, if so, to what extent the increased social isolation resulting from physical distancing measures in the current situation will have an even greater impact on health outcomes than has been suggested in this review. Arguably, an even greater impact can be expected for certain risk groups, such as older people who are more threatened by COVID-19 and socially disadvantaged groups (e.g., individuals in need of mental or physical health care or",

Ten meta-analyses reported associations of social isolation, living alone, and loneliness with physical health outcomes, and 15 with mental health outcomes. Different indicators of social connection were measured in the included studies. We considered as structural indicators of social connection: social isolation defined as an objectively quantifiable variable of one's social network ties irrespective of its perceived quality and living alone as an objective characteristic of the living situation. Furthermore, we defined loneliness as a quality indictor representing the subjective emotional appraisal of the extent and quality of social relationships.2  The meta-analyses differed with respect to whether they kept these three measures of social connection separate of whether they combined them (see Tab. 1).Figure 1 &Table 1A total of 276 primary studies were included in the 10 meta-analyses on physical health. However, there was some overlap in samples in meta-analyses that examined cardiovascular disease17,18  and early mortality.4,19  Steptoe and Kivim\u00e4ki 17 and Valtorta et al.18  shared one primary study.

            "text": "19 analyses were conducted with longitudinal studies. In particular, longitudinal data indicate that social connection is associated with increased risk of several physical and mental health outcomes, cardiovascular disease, hospital readmission in heart failure patients, early mortality, cognitive impairment, and depression.4,17,19,25,27,39,40,28,30,29 However, the findings are all based on observational studies and do not provide evidence on the causal direction of the association. Poor physical and mental health can lead to lack of social connection, and lack of social connection can lead to poorer health. For establishing a causal relationship and examining the strength of the predictive relationship of social isolation and loneliness with health outcomes experimental studies are required, which were not the subject of this review.5,41 Experimental research with animals, however, suggests that lack of social connection increases mortality.42 Furthermore, experimental studies with humans indicate that randomly inducing loneliness or exclusion leads to different health relevant physiological responses than being randomly assigned to a support condition.42 For most of the considered outcomes in this review, a causal effect of social connection is plausible and likely to explain at least part of the identified associations. The casual direction is definite in case of the greater risk of isolated people to die early.4  For an explanation of the damaging effect of social connection on health outcomes, one may refer to different theoretical models. Theorists from different perspectives have postulated that the impact of social connection on health is mediated by impairments in social capital, 43 social control, 44 social identification,45",

All samples were collected from individuals who reported no symptoms associated with COVID-19 on the day of collection. From these, 1,405 positive cases were identified. The distribution of viral loads within these asymptomatic individuals was indistinguishable from what has been previously reported in symptomatic individuals.",

During the ensuing world-wide pandemic, already more than two million lives have been lost due to the virus. Spread of SARS-CoV-2 has thus far been extremely difficult to contain. One key reason for this is that both pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals can unwittingly transmit the virus to others [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Further, it is becoming clear that certain individuals play a key role in seeding super-spreading events [14] [15] [16] [17] . Here, we analyzed data from a large university surveillance program. Viral loads were measured in saliva, which has proven to be an accessible and reliable biospecimen in which to identify carriers of this respiratory pathogen, and the most likely medium for SARS-CoV-2 transmission [18] [19] [20] . Our dataset is unique in that all SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals reported no symptoms at the time of saliva collection, and therefore were infected but asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. We find that the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads on our campus is indistinguishable from what has previously been observed in symptomatic individuals. Strikingly, these datasets demonstrate widespread differences in viral levels between individuals, with a very small minority of the infected individuals harboring the majority of the infectious virions.",

The distribution of the Ct values of these 1,405 individuals, with each of the two primer sets used, is shown in Figure 1A . Overall, the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 viral load fits under a log-normal distribution centered around the geometric mean of 7.3x10 5 virions/mL (CU-E primers) or 1.5x10 6 virions/mL (CU-N primers). The highest observed viral load was over 6 trillion (6.1 x 10 12 ) virions/mL, which was only observed in 1 individual, while the lowest viral load detected was 8 virions/mL.

(which was not certified by peer review) To verify that these viral load distributions were not influenced by the specific RT-PCR primers used, we determined the agreement between the CU-N and CU-E primers with regard to the Ct values produced from samples. We find a tight correlation at Ct values < 30 (Pearson correlation coefficient of CU-N and CU-E Ct values = 0.92), but this correlation breaks down at higher Ct values (Pearson correlation coefficient of CU-N and CU-E Ct values = 0.10, Figure   1B ). At high Ct values (i.e. low viral loads) weaker correlation is likely a result of stochasticity in reverse transcription or initial rounds of PCR. This is supported by an in-depth analysis .

ND = no data, as the viral load is below the RT-qPCR detection limit.

Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) are shown within and beyond the Ct=30 arbitrary cutoff.

We identified 404 datapoints that met such criteria, which we collated from the 10 studies listed in Supplementary Table S1 . Similar to the geometric mean that we observed in our campus asymptomatic population (7.3x10 5 virions/mL), the viral load in symptomatic patient saliva samples shows a log-normal distribution with a geometric mean of 4.0x10 5 virions/mL and varied from very high viral loads (9.5x10 10 virions/mL) to viral loads near the limit of detection (1.3 virions/mL) (Figure 2A) .

This can be understood because Ct is a linear representation of logarithmic increases in vial load, so that the viral load increases exponentially as the Ct value decreases (Supplemental Figure S1) . Thus, there is a highly asymmetric distribution of viruses within both populations, with just a small number of people carrying the vast majority of the virus. It remains unknown whether these are special individuals capable of harboring extraordinarily high viral loads, or whether many infected individuals pass through a very short time period of extremely high viral load (see further discussion below).

In both asymptomatic (blue line) and symptomatic populations (red line), the portion of population that harbors 90% and 99% of the circulating virus is highlighted by the dashed lines. We estimate that only about 50% of individuals who test positive for the virus actually harbor live virus, based on the observation that live virus has rarely been isolated from samples with viral loads <10 6 virions per mL [28, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . For context, typical limits of detection of three major SARS-CoV-2 testing paradigms are shown. RT-qPCR on purified RNA is the most sensitive, with RT-LAMP and antigen tests performed directly on biological fluids being less sensitive. However, all testing paradigms will capture virtually all infectious individuals and virions, in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic populations alike. Limits of detection are taken from [36, 37] .",

These findings corroborate similar trends observed elsewhere [14] [15] [16] [17] 25] . Although it remains to be seen exactly how transmission probability relates to viral load, a strong implication is that these individuals who are viral super-carriers may also be super-spreaders. Higher viral loads have been shown to increase the probability of transmission to others in China [38] , in Spain [39] , and between pairs of roommates on our University campus (Bjorkman et al, in prep). A higher rate of spread by viral super-carriers would be consistent with recent contact tracing analyses suggesting that 80-90% of infections are spread by 10-20% of infected individuals [14] [15] [16] [17] . A higher rate of spread by viral super-carriers would also be consistent with the surprisingly low transmission rates being reported between roommates (Bjorkman et al, in prep), schoolmates [40, 41] , and household members [42] , which could be explained if only a small fraction of infected individuals have high enough viral loads to facilitate active transmission.",

Community screening to identify viral super-carriers within pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic stages of disease will be important, since these individuals will continue to sustain and drive the epidemic if not located. Finding viral super-carriers will have a disproportionately large impact on curbing new COVID-19 infections, yet individuals without symptoms don't tend to seek out testing so screening will need to target healthy populations. Modeling approaches show that one of the most important factors in screening for SARS-CoV-2 will be the speed with which infected people receive their test results (also referred to as turnaround time) [50] . The longer it takes for people to receive their results, the more time goes by where they might unwittingly infect others. Therefore, it is imperative that we find virus super-carriers, and inform them of their infection status in a way that is fast, easy, and accessible. Although sensitivities vary between current monitoring and diagnostic paradigms, all are more than capable of finding the majority of infected individuals and the vast majority of infectious virions (Figure 3) .",

Samples were incubated at ambient temperature for 15 minutes and then heated to 95 0 C for 5 minutes to inactive the Proteinase K. Next, 5 \u00b5L of saliva was used as template in a 20 \u00b5L reaction that also contained 1X TaqPath 1-step Multiplex Master Mix, nuclease free water and primer and probe sets at concentrations described here. The RT-qPCR was run on the BioRad CFX96 qPCR machine using the same program described for the CU assays. Along with residual saliva samples, a duplicate serial dilution of contrived positive samples made from healthy donor saliva and heat inactivated viral particles were carried through the SalivaDirect protocol [20] .

Ct values from all campus testing efforts were communicated to us as de-identified data.Focused analysis of 105 SARS-CoV-2 positive samplesFor smaller subsets of samples, as described herein, we did a side-by-side comparisonof 3 different quantitative RT-PCR multiplex assays commonly used in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. We thawed 105 frozen, de-identified saliva samples which had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the campus screening operation. We performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis using different primer probe combinations. First, 25 \u00b5L of thawed, previously heattreated saliva was transferred into a 96-well plate where each well had been pre-loaded with 25 \u00b5L 2xTBE buffer supplemented with 1% Tween-20. Next, 5 \u00b5L of the diluted sample was added to separate 96-well plates containing 15 \u00b5L reaction mix composed of: TaqPath 1-step Multiplex Master Mix (Thermo Fisher A28523), nuclease-free water and CDC triplex primer mix or CU triplex primer mix (sequence and concentration specified in the table below). The reactions were mixed, spun down, and loaded onto a Bio-Rad CFX96 qPCR machine. Quantitative RT-PCR was run using the standard mode, consisting of a hold stage (25 o C for 2 minutes, 50 o C for 15 minutes, and 95 o C for 2 minutes) followed by 44 cycles of a PCR stage (95 o C for 3 seconds, 55 o C for 30 seconds, with a 1.6 o C/sec ramp up and ramp down rate). Each plate also contained wells with 5 \u00b5L negative control template containing nuclease-free water diluted 1:1 with 1%Tween-20 and 5 \u00b5L positive control template containing synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Twist Biosciences 102024) diluted to 1000 genome copies/\u00b5L and total human reference RNA (Agilent 750500) diluted to 10ng/\u00b5L in nuclease-free water.",

Using 105 SARS-CoV-2 positive saliva samples, we examined the Ct values obtained with different RT-qPCR multiplex assays and compared them via correlation analysis. For 105 virus-positive saliva samples, 8 different Ct values were generated all in one day from each sample, in a side-by-side direct analysis of the performance of each primer set. Ct values from the Centers for Disease Control primers (CDC-E, CDC-N or CDC-RNaseP) are reported on the X-axes. On the Y-axes are plotted the corresponding Ct values resulted from our university screening primers (CU-E, CU-N or CU-RNaseP) and primer sets used in the SalivaDirect [20] test (SalivaDirect-N and SalivaDirect-RNase P) primer sets.",

Liquid chalk 29 is a commonly used accessories in gyms and is comprised of magnesium carbonate and alcohol 30 that quickly evaporates on the hands to leave a layer of dry chalk. We investigated whether 31 liquid chalk is an antiseptic against highly pathogenic human viruses including, SARS-CoV-32 2, influenza virus and noroviruses. Chalk was applied before or after virus inoculum and 33 recovery of infectious virus was determined to mimic the use in the gym. We observed that 34 addition of chalk before or after virus contact lead to a significant reduction on recovery of 35 infectious SARS-CoV-2 and influenza but had little impact on norovirus. These observations 36 suggest that the use and application of liquid chalk can be an effective and suitable antiseptic 37 for major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games. 38 39 Introduction 40 The use and application of hand sanitizers in preventing the spread of infectious 41 microbial diseases is primarily based on the 60-80% v/v of alcohol included within these 42 products [1, 2]. The use of hand sanitizers has been an important control measure in limiting 43 the spread of virus during the recent COVID-19 pandemic in some settings [3, 4]. Liquid Chalk 44 is a product that comprises of magnesium carbonate (chalk), 40-80% alcohol (generally 45 ethanol, methanol or isopropanol), water and sometimes other additives including resins or 46 proprietary materials, depending on the manufacturer. When applied to the hands the liquid 47 chalk is distributed across the surface of the hand and then dries into a thin chalk layer as the 48 alcohol evaporates. Due to the high percentage of alcohol, liquid chalk has been suggested to",

The infection with SARS-CoV-2 is 110 covered by our Institutional Biosafety Committee approval number 2020/028. 111 112 Results 113 Experimental rationale 114 In our experimental design we investigated two different approaches to represent the 115 scenarios encountered within the gym environment. Firstly, we tested the application of liquid 116 chalk on a surface that already contained the virus, and secondly, we tested the ability of liquid 117 chalk to prevent transmission once applied to a surface with subsequent addition of the virus. 118 For the virus first experiments, a volume containing a known titre of virus (SARS-CoV-2, IAV 119 or MNV) was applied to a plastic surface. Subsequently, a known volume of four commercially 120 available and widely used liquid chalk products was added, smeared to thin layer and then 121 allowed to dry. The entire layer was then resuspended in tissue culture media and the chalk 122 particulate was removed by centrifugation. The resultant supernatant was then diluted and 123 added to Vero (SARS-CoV-2), MDCK (IAV) or RAW264.7 cells (MNV) and virus infectivity 124 was measured by TCID 50 /mL. For the chalk first experiments, the exact same procedure 6 125 described above was performed except the volume of chalk was applied first and allowed to 126 dry and then the volume of virus was added to the dried chalk. 127 128 Liquid chalk prevents the recovery of infectious SARS-CoV-2 129As can be observed inFigure 1, all four liquid chalk products significantly impacted 130 the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 virus from the surface to which it was applied. Intriguingly, 131 Chalk #1-3 all displayed complete loss of the recovery of virus (to the limit of detection)",

In this assay, the alcohol 135 contained in the liquid chalk product was allowed to evaporate prior to contact with virus, 136 suggesting the dried chalk provided a viricidal activity. To confirm the antiviral effects of 137 alcohols, we treated SARS-CoV-2 virus preparations with differing amounts and types of 138 alcohols (including those commonly found in Liquid Chalk products). As summarised in Table 139 1, we observed that all alcohols had a virucidal effect on SARS-CoV-2. Thus, our results 140 indicate that the application and implementation of Liquid Chalk can be a suitable antiseptic 141 against the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Liquid chalk itself was not cytotoxic to any of the 142 cell types used in this study at the concentrations shown to be effective in reducing virus 143 recovery (Supplementary Figure 1). SARS-CoV-2 is rendered non-infectious by gym Liquid Chalk. All chalks tested 146 significantly reduced the amount of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in the sample compared to the no 147 chalk control (ND = not detectable) when added either before or after the viral inoculum.

When chalk was first applied to 163 the surface, all chalks induced an approximate 2-4 log decrease in virus recovery. Overall, 164 these results indicate that the application of liquid both to IAV or onto a surface can reduce the 165 recovery of IAV.166 Influenza A virus is significantly inactivated by Liquid Chalk.

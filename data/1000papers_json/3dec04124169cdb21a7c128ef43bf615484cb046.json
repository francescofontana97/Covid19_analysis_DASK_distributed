Did countries with more effective COVID-19 control programmes \u2500 those that reported fewer cases and deaths \u2500 have flatter epidemic curves? How has the scale and shape of European epidemics been changed by interventions, especially physical distancing under lockdown? Figure 2 approaches these questions with respect to the number and distribution of deaths through time for 24 European countries. Rather than using a dynamic epidemiological model to describe these epidemics, such as an SEIR model which is constrained by assumptions of, for example homogeneous mixing and exponentially distributed time periods (Supplementary Materials), we used an empirical model (skew-logistic) to measure the rate of epidemic growth, the maximum number of deaths per week, the period of growth (time from one death to the maximum number of weekly deaths), and the rate of decline. The empirical model gives an excellent description of COVID-19 epidemics across Europe; it is also more discriminating between epidemics than estimates of the time-varying case reproduction number (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6 ). The total number of reported deaths was 5.6 (95%CI 0.29) times the peak number of weekly deaths across the 24 countries (R 2 = 0.98, Figure 3a ). The principal determinant of variation in the number of deaths among countries was neither the rate of epidemic growth (R 2 = 0.01, Figure 3b ) nor the rate of decline (R 2 = 0.03, Figure 3c ), but rather the duration of growth \u2500 the period over which the epidemic was allowed to expand (t = 3.91, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.41, Figure  3d ).",

In other words, the effect of population size is accommodated within the measure of net growth. There is a hint in these data that the size of a COVID-19 epidemic increased more than linearly with national population size (N, millions), such that the number of deaths, = 51.1 . . The implication is that population size is more than an epidemic scaling factor, with effects that are not fully captured as deaths per capita. However, the exponent 1.32 is not significantly greater than unity (t = 1.64, p > 0.05). In any event, epidemics expanded more, and caused more deaths, in countries with larger populations.",

Unusually, Belgium has reported more COVID-19 deaths than all excess deaths, but only around 15% more (Supplementary Materials), whereas observed and expected COVID-19 deaths differ by a factor of 10 in Figure 4 . Sweden never achieved a Stringency score as high as 70% (maximum 46%) and reported a relatively large number of deaths (4900) among Scandinavian countries (fewer than 600 in each of Denmark and Norway). However, the general relationship in Figure 4 predicts a far higher death toll. The reasons why Belgium and Sweden do not conform to the general pattern in Figure 4 remain to be determined.",

However, a comparison of COVID-19 deaths and all excess deaths in Switzerland (Fig 1, Fig S3 below) questions the completeness of death reports at the peak of the epidemic. Nevertheless, the large differences in numbers of reported deaths between countries, and in number of deaths per capita, are very unlikely to be due solely to differences in diagnostic and reporting methods (2) . Indeed, the clear patterns of association in Figs 3 and 4 of the main text suggest that both the data and the empirical model portray real effects, rather than artefacts, of COVID-19 epidemics across the 26 countries studied in this investigation.",

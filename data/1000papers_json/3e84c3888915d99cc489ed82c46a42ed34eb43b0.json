Mast cells (MCs) are polyfunctional 3 immune cells present in the airways, where they respond to certain viruses and allergens, often 4 promoting inflammation. We observed widespread degranulation of MCs during acute and unresolved 5 airway inflammation in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice and non-human primates. In humans, transcriptional 6 changes in patients requiring oxygen supplementation also implicated cells with a MC phenotype. MC 7 activation in humans was confirmed, through detection of the MC-specific protease, chymase, levels of 8 which were significantly correlated with disease severity. These results support the association of MC 9 activation with severe COVID-19, suggesting potential strategies for intervention. 10 11 12 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Clinical 15 disease ranges from asymptomatic to mild to severe, and manifestations include upper respiratory tract 16 symptoms, pneumonia and, in some cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1) . Fever, cough 17 and anosmia are most commonly experienced at disease presentation and complications involving the 18 vascular system can occur during severe disease (1) . The lung is a major target organ of SARS-CoV- 2 19 infection due to abundant expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a cellular 20 entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (2) . The virus is typically shed from the nasopharyngeal tract and 21 disseminated by coughing, but it can also be detected in fecal excretions (3) . Various mouse and non-22 human primate (NHP) models have been utilized to study COVID-19 (4) . Non-human primates (NHPs) 23 and human ACE2 (hACE2) knock-in mice both have been shown to experience infection and recapitulate 24 human signs of disease in the lung, including lung pathology (4) . In human autopsy studies of severe 25 disease, infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lung tissue concurrent with edema and hemorrhage are 26 frequently described (5) . It is believed that lung pathology during COVID-19 is immune-mediated and 27 compounded by the infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils and subsets of T cells (6) . Interestingly, 28",

Tissue resident MCs have a mature phenotype and express a variety of pathogen recognition 36 molecules on their surface and inside cytosolic compartments (11, 12) . Their granules are loaded with pre-37 formed mediators such as histamine, serotonin and unique MC-specific proteases, chymase and tryptase, 38 among others. Some of their mediators, including soluble cytokines and lipid mediators, may be also 39 produced by other granulocytes and immune cells (13) . MC-derived products not only promote tissue 40 inflammation through the recruitment of cells such as monocytes, neutrophils and T cells, they also have 41 significant effects on vascular permeability and vasomotor control (9, 12, 14) . The influence of MCs on 42 vasomotor control, including vasoconstriction and vasodilation, may also contribute to hypoxia that occurs 43 through shunting, which can influence vascular and tissue integrity (15) . The tissue-specific 44 microenvironment where a MC resides influences its phenotype. For example, MCs in the atopic lung 45 express higher levels of IgE receptor, Fc\u03b5R1 than in the skin (16, 17) and lung MCs are well characterized 46 to contribute to pathological lung inflammation during conditions such as asthma (18) . MCs are known to 47 coordinate effective immune responses against invading pathogens, including viruses(12) but their 48 activation has also been linked to severe tissue damage, such as during dengue virus (DENV) 49",

In a human cohort, prospective analysis of the transcriptional signatures of MC-precursors 63 were highly enriched in the blood of patients who presented with severe COVID-19 disease, suggesting 64 modulation of this cell type during disease, as were several host response pathways for prominent MC-65 derived products.

Given the association of MCs with chronic airway inflammation, their immune sentinel role for certain viral 74 pathogens, and knowing that severe lung inflammation also characterizes COVID-19, we first questioned 75 whether MCs are activated in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used an established mouse 76 model where the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, hACE2, is delivered to the lungs using an adenovirus 77 vector (25) . After hACE2-AAV inoculation, mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1A) . Blood was 78 collected at multiple time points to assess MC-associated inflammatory products and tissues were 79 collected on days 5 and 7 post-infection for virus quantification by PCR. Mice showed the highest 80 infection burden in the lungs, but for at least some of the animals, SARS-CoV-2 could also be detected in 81 the spleen, liver, kidney, brain, and bone marrow (Fig. 1B) , while the brachial lymph nodes were PCR-82 negative at both time points (Fig. S1) .

The trachea tissue 86 from control uninfected animals also appears healthy and compact, while the thickness of the trachea 87 tissue in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals appears increased as a result of inflammation and swelling (Fig.  88   1C ).

Proximal to blood vessels there was also evidence of infiltration of immune cells into the 119 tissue ( Fig. 2G ) and fibrin deposition (Fig. S3) . In multiple locations within the lung, including in the 120 trachea and the lower lung lobes, as well as near bronchi and near alveolar spaces, hypodense MCs 121 could be observed after staining of tissue sections with toluidine blue, suggesting their recent 122 degranulation (Fig. 2H) . Free granules could be observed extracellularly near MCs (Fig. 2H) , also 123 indicating degranulation. This widespread activation of MCs was confirmed by fluorescence staining to 124 detect heparin-containing granules in the lung tissue ( Fig. 2I-K) . We noted that activated MCs were 125 especially densely located and degranulating within the hemorrhagic regions of the infected lung tissue 126 In healthy humans, MC precursors make up a minor component of the blood, ~0.005% of cells (26) . MCs 134 are known to have a unique transcriptional profile that clusters separately from other immune cells and 135 gene expression patterns have been identified that are either MC-specific or that typify both MCs and 136 basophils (27) . Although MCs are not present in mature form in the blood, we considered that their 137 activation in peripheral tissues could influence the MC precursors or lead to transcriptional activation 138 profiles in immune cells that are consistent with responses to systemically elevated MC-associated 139 products. To investigate this, we examined whole blood transcriptomics data from a cohort of 4 mild and 6 140 severe COVID-19 patients, where clusters of genes that were temporally modulated during severe 141 disease progression and resolution were identified (28) . Consenting patients were prospectively recruited 142 and were defined as severe on the basis of requiring supplemental oxygen during hospitalization. In the 143 patients with severe disease, the gene expression levels were monitored from -4 days to 13 days, 144 relative to the day when their condition peaked in severity of respiratory distress, which was defined as 145 time=0 (28) . Interestingly, many genes associated with the MC lineage ( Fig. 3A-B) or MC and also 146 basophil lineages (Fig. 3C-D) were differentially modulated in the blood of human COVID-19 patients with 147 All rights reserved.

Upregulation of several genes 148 associated with the MC-or MC/basophil transcriptional signature (27) occurred during the acute phase of 149 severe disease (Fig. 3A,C) , while others were differentially regulated at the time of disease resolution 150 (Fig. 3B,D) . The increased MC gene expression changes that were observed during the acute phase of 151 disease tracked tightly with respiratory function and resolved commensurate with respiratory improvement 152 (Fig. 3E) . In contrast, these MC-associated transcripts were not collectively changed temporally 153 throughout the period of monitoring in mild COVID-19 presentation (Fig S4A-E) , although some genes 154 that were associated with these signatures were still modulated, but to a lesser extent than in severe 155 patients ( Fig. S4A-D) . Pathway analysis of the temporally modulated genes over the disease course of 156 severely ill patients revealed significant perturbation of pathways downstream of key MC-associated 157 immune receptors (Fig. 3F ) such as KIT (Fig. 3G) , the receptor for stem cell factor, which is an important 158 stem cell-associated gene that is retained on MC precursors and mature MCs and regulates MC survival 159 and proliferation (29) , and Fc\u03b5RI (Fig. 3H) , which is upregulated with MC maturation, although also 160 expressed by other cell types such as basophils (26, 27) . These data show an enrichment of MC-161 associated transcripts in patients with severe COVID-19 and support a potential role of MCs in shaping 162 disease severity. 163 164",

This cohort was chosen since they have many of the risk factors of COVID-19 patients and are of 186 a similar age. In both mild and severe COVID-19 cases, the plasma sample was collected at the time of 187 diagnosis for the majority of patients. These results indicated that hospitalized COVID-19 inpatients have 188 significantly higher levels of plasma chymase compared to community cases (Fig. 4B) . This difference 189 was emphasized when the chymase levels in community cases were compared to hospitalized patients 190 that required intubation (Fig. 4B) . Published reports highlight the importance of microvascular 191 abnormalities in defining COVID-19 severity (31) and are supported by the demonstration of alveolar 192 edema and hemorrhagic lesions in our murine and NHP models. MC activation has direct impact on 193 vascular function and integrity and, therefore, we tested if MC activation was linked to vascular barrier 194 dysfunction. For this, we measured Angiopoietin (Ang)-1 and -2 levels as markers of endothelial 195 activation, which are strongly linked with disease severity in ARDS(32) and COVID-19 (32) and found no 196 change in Ang1 levels (Fig. 4C ), yet higher Ang2 levels (Fig. 4D) , resulting in higher Ang2/Ang1 ratios 197 (Fig 4E) in hospitalized and intubated vs. community COVID-19 cases. We also recruited a smaller 198 number of COVID-19 patients in Singapore. Indeed, this second cohort of COVID-19 patients also had 199 elevated chymase that was much higher than healthy controls and also averaged higher than the 200 concentrations detected in acute dengue patients (Fig. S5) . These data were not stratified by severity due The activation response involves a degranulation and release of MC-associated pre-formed mediators, 208 which was confirmed visually by imaging of tissue sections as well as quantitatively by detection of MC-209 specific chymase in the serum. MCs are present in the lung tissue, even prior to birth, and they are 210 important for regulating lung tissue inflammation during homeostasis and disease (33) . The heightened 211 levels of persistent activation of MCs that we detected through the acute phase of natural and 212 experimental SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to be important for amplifying inflammation, which could 213 be detrimental to recovery from infection and return to tissue homeostasis following infection clearance. In 214 mouse and NHP lung tissue, MCs were observed to be strongly degranulating, and their increased 215 density and morphological appearance of activation was associated with areas of tissue damage 216 characterized by edema, hemorrhaging and necrosis. This is consistent with the role for MCs in mediating 217 inflammation and pathology in the lung that was suggested by mouse models of highly pathogenic 218 influenza (22, 34) . The persistent activated state observed in the lungs of NHPs, with sustained evidence 219 of MC activation at the relatively late time point post-infection when samples were no longer PCR-positive 220 for virus detection, suggests that ongoing inflammation in the tissue may occur even after infection has 221 All rights reserved.

(C) No significant changes in ANG1 levels in inpatient and intubated patients compared to community cases and non-COVID-19 controls. (D) Significantly increased plasma ANG2 levels and (E) ANG2/ANG1 ratios in inpatients compared to community patients. One-way ANOVA was performed and considered significant for post-test p-values <0.05. For panels, B-E, non-COVID-19 patients n=12-15; For community, n=13; for inpatients n=24; n=7.

Whether MCs can also be activated by autoantibodies that are evoked in the absence of an 233 active infection remains to be elucidated and might be relevant to long COVID-19 with persistent 234 symptoms. 235 236 We also observed transcriptional responses of severe COVID-19 patients that coincide with peak 237 respiratory distress and which point to the enhanced function or abundance of cells having a MC-like 238 phenotype. Pathways characteristic of pro-inflammatory responses of responder cells to MC-derived 239 products were also modulated. Since mature MCs are not present in the blood(10) and only present in 240 tissues, the MC associated phenotype described here is likely more consistent with MC precursors than 241 with mature MCs. We noted that transcripts of proteins that are specific to mature granulated MCs, such 242 as chymase, were not identified as a component of the MC-associated transcriptional profile that was 243 induced along the time course of peak severity. These results are highly suggestive of the expansion or 244 increased maturation of MC precursors in the blood, but further studies are needed to fully understand the 245 responses of this cellular compartment to infection. A limitation here is the potential to only monitor 246 transcriptional responses in the human blood, yet, our animal model data supports that there is expansion 247 of MCs in the lung tissue as well. This is consistent with the observation in a murine model of H1N1 248 influenza infection where recruitment and maturation of MC progenitors in the lung was suggested to 249 occur approximately 2 weeks after the infection(34). We also noted an unusually high density of MCs in 250 damaged and hemorrhagic regions NHP lungs at 3 weeks post SARS-CoV-2 infection.

As exemplified by the 280 endothelial activation in severe COVID-19, this highlights a potential causal role of MC activation in 281 critical features of COVID-19 disease, including abnormalities of pulmonary blood flow leading to shunting 282 and hypoxemia or loss of endothelial integrity leading to tissue edema. Notwithstanding its role as an 283 angiotensin converting enzyme, a more direct effect of chymase in cleaving endothelial tight junctions or 284 potential contributions of other MC products, such as tryptase and serotonin(12), in COVID-19 related 285 vascular pathologies cannot be ruled out. As such, we found intriguing parallels to DENV as another virus 286 that induces MC activation. Although DENV does not specifically infect the lung, DENV infection is also 287 characterized by increases in microvascular permeability and bleeding, which are augmented through the 288 actions of MCs. It is noteworthy that in dengue, MCs play an important role in limiting virus burden in early 289 disease, but drive clinical deterioration in disseminated disease(12). As a result, drugs targeting MCs and 290 their products are promising as a therapeutic strategy to prevent severe clinical courses in DENV 291 infection and may bear similar promise in preventing severe COVID-19, which warrants further evaluation.",

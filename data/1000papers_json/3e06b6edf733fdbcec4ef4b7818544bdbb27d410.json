Also,\u03c1 = 32.1667 days shows that the time for virus infection is very close to one month period. Using the parameter estimates from Table 3 and the latent proportion (\u03b8), we reached information about the peak from SIR curve for the COVID-19 transmission in Brazil, that is the time when the proportion of infected individuals reaches its maximum.

The model was estimated considering COVID-19 data in Brazil, assuming a reporting rate between 0.05 and 1.00, varying every 0.05. Aiming the practical point of view, we conduct a simulation study to investigate the effects of under-reporting in the parameters of the SIR model and how it impacts on the pandemic curve behavior. For each value of \u03b7, a chain of 300,000 interactions was generated, with a burn-in of 10,000 and a thin of 300. Figure 2 shows the point estimates and 95% credible intervals for \u03b2 and \u03b3 versus the reported rate values.

The graphics with the point estimates and 95% credible intervals for R 0 and infection period \u03c1 versus the reported rates are shown in Figure 3 , from which we observe that R 0 decreases as the reported rate increases and \u03c1 keeps roughly invariant, then we can conclude that the reproduction rate and infection period can be underestimated when under-reporting is ignored, affording an unreal impression on a tiny mean number of secondary individuals that a primary individual can infect, when in fact it is large. Figure 4 shows the estimated SIR curves for COVID-19 versus reported rate, from which we observe that the lower the reported rate, the earlier the peak is reached with a higher proportion of infected individuals.

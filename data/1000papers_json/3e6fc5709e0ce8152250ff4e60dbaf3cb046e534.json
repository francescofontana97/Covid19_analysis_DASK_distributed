A large number of cities across the world entered \"sleep mode\" sequentially due to the stay-at-home or lockdown policies. This study exploits the impact of pandemic-induced human mobility restrictions, as the response to COVID-19 pandemic, on the urban air quality across China. Different from the \"traditional\" difference-in-differences analysis, a human mobility-based difference-in-differences method is used to quantify the effect of intracity mobility reductions on air quality across 325 cities in China. The model shows that the air quality index (AQI) experiences a 12.2% larger reduction in the cities with lockdown. Moreover, this reduction effect varies with different types of air pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , and CO decreased by 13.1%, 15.3%, 4%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively). The heterogeneity analysis in terms of different types of cities shows that the effect is greater in northern, higher income, more industrialized cities, and more economically active cities. We also estimate the subsequent health benefits following such improvement, and the expected averted premature deaths due to air pollution declines are around 26,385 to 38,977 during the sample period. These findings illuminate a new light on the role of a policy intervention in the pollution emission, while also providing a roadmap for future research on the pollution effect of COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Many cases of viral pneumonia were found in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in central China since early December of 2019, which were subsequently confirmed to have been caused by a new kind of virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) officially named this new virus as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on February 11, 2020, which was confirmed to have the capabilities of human-to-human transmission (Chan et al. 2020) . The large-scale spread of this COVID-19 occurred during China's Spring Festival, which is a period of the world's most massive annual migration. The mass migration movements provide COVID-19 with an active environment for its spread; the virus spreads from the epicenter of the pandemic, Wuhan, to the rest of the world. The fast-spreading COVID-19 has been reported to have infected 8,385,440 people, with 450,686 deaths across 216 countries, areas, or territories as of June 19, 2020, 1 according to the statistics of the WHO, and the growth trend in the number of infected persons is still ongoing, which suggests that one of the worst global pandemics is looming. At the onset of COVID-19 outbreaks in early December of 2019, the academia and citizens have little knowledge about the virus transmission, resulting in the delay of effective measures to counter this deteriorating situation. At least it was not until 10:00 am on January 23, 2020, when the imposed lockdown of Wuhan was put into implementation, in the other remaining cities of Hubei Province after a few days. As of February 29, 2020, different levels of lockdown policies were issued across 107 cities in 22 provinces. 2 These lockdown policies have created the most extensive quarantine in public health history, with impacts on every aspect of lives, including the environment. Since the lockdown policies strictly restricted human mobility and the logistics suffering from staffing shortages, both have resulted in a remarkable decrease in industrial activities and vehicle use in cities. Consequently, most cities experience a considerably low level of pollution compared with normal conditions (Lewis 2020; Freedman and Tierney 2020; Monks 2020; Singh and Chauhan 2020) . Concerning China, almost all researchers found a strong positive association between the reduction of air pollution and human mobility restrictions during this pandemic, focusing on different regions in China (Li et al. 2020; Bao and Zhang 2020; Xu et al. 2020) . The improved air quality and the possible associated health benefits may be the only light in the \"darkness\" caused by negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

On the one hand, both the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding measures to contain it have been unprecedented in modern times, including a better understanding of every aspect of the economic, environmental, and health impacts of this pandemic, contributing to hastening the recovery and drawing some lessons for the future pandemics. A city-level lockdown offers us an opportunity to examine how different pollutants may respond to human mobility restrictions, which provides a reference for policymakers and planners in considering milder forms of restrictions on human activities to reduce pollution. Moreover, through calculating the lockdown-induced pollution, the authors identify the pollution costs accrue from reliance on fossil-based transportation and power generation during normal times. On the other hand, the improved air quality caused by the lockdown is also conducive to lessening the strain on health services by reducing morbidity and mortality, since air pollution has been the most substantial single environmental health risk (WHO 2014), particularly leading to an increase in cancer incidences, such as lung cancer and cancer of the urinary tract/bladder. While the continuing increase of various pollutants in China over the past four decades makes it worse; for instance, the concentration of PM 2.5 has increased more than twofold from 1980 to 2015 to 66.90 \u03bcg/m 3 , which is more than five times as much of the criteria of PM 2.5 in the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of the USA. 3 Given the severity of air pollution in China, hospital attendance and admissions would almost certainly have even been higher in the absence of air quality improvement. Besides, the positive connection between exposure to pollution and COVID-19 mortality has been confirmed by the research of Wu et al. (2020) . Therefore, the lockdown-induced air quality improvement can play a role in relieving the pressure on hospitals in terms of accommodating COVID-19 patients and reducing the associated death rate.",

Given the potential problem of endogeneity in simple time-series regressions, this study adopts a human mobility-based difference-in-differences (DID) analysis as our main specification to address this concern. This study may contribute to policy intervention-air quality literature in the following four areas. First, the intracity population migration data from Baidu Migration is used to measure the magnitude of human mobility change caused by lockdown policies instead of using a binary variable to represent the sample period before or after the lockdown date. Second, the meteorological data and daily city-level concentrations of six pollutants (particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and air quality index (AQI) data) at the monitorlevel are merged to investigate the causal impact of city lockdown on air quality. Third, this study adopts the human mobility-based DID, according to Correia et al. (2020) , in combination with Sant' Anna and Zhao (2018) and Callaway and Sant'Anna (2018) researches to handle DID with multiple time periods. Last, this paper adds to the existing literature exploring policy interventions-related impacts on pollution and offers a reference for the central and local governments in air pollution reduction through milder forms of restrictions on human activities in normal times.",

On the one hand, sun and high temperatures can function as catalysts for chemical processes of air pollutants. In contrast, on the other hand, air pollutants will be removed from the atmosphere by precipitation. Because of the unit of analysis based on daily data, a set of time fixed effects (year, month, weekend, and holidays) was also added. The meteorological data used in this study were all collected from local meteorological stations across China.

This migration data is captured from Baidu's mapping app that records the real-time locations through individuals' smartphones. Considering the monopoly of Baidu in search engines due to China's ban on using all Google search sites, this dataset can precisely reflect the human mobility at the city level. 7 Three daily migration intensity indicators, including in-migration (IM) index, outmigration (OM) index, and the within-city migration (WM) index, are available in 364 cities of China, with all of them being consistent across cities and time. A higher value is directly proportional to a higher degree of population mobility, as one index unit in the former two indicators and WM index corresponds to 90,848 and 2,182,264 person movements, respectively, according to the estimation of Fang et al. (2020) . Since the focus of this study is pandemic-induced air quality change in each city of China, the inter-city population mobility cannot reflect the change in the share of fossil-based transportation and power generation in the destination cities. Moreover, the daily WM index is capable of reflecting the change of economic activities of a specific city, which is generally correlated with the air pollution level of the corresponding city. Therefore, the WM index was employed to measure the intensity of pandemic-induced human mobility restrictions. Figure 1 depicts the change in the migration statistics and the number of new cities to come under lockdown during the sample period, which shows a remarkable discontinuity in the average intracity migration around the Wuhan lockdown date. Meanwhile, the largest share of cities to come under lockdown happened followed by the significant decline in the intracity migration intensity during February, 2020.",

The final balanced panel covered 325 cities (the spatial distribution of them is shown in Fig. 2 ) with at least one meteorological station within 100 km from each city's centroid and one air quality monitoring station within the urban area of each city. Figure 2 illustrates the change in the average value of AQI from cities that imposed lockdown policies during the sample period; it can be seen that all cities in the treatment group experienced a varying degree of reduction in air pollution.

Interestingly, this negative relationship still retains its robustness across columns (2) to (5), indicating that there exists a negative correlation between city lockdown and air pollution levels.

According to the difference in population, GDP level, per capita GDP level, electricity consumption by city, and geographical distribution (i.e., South and North along the Huai River), all cities in this study were divided into different subgroups. For instance, when a city's population is higher than the mean population, it will fall into a \"high\" group, otherwise the \"low\" group. Table 6 presents estimates of the regression specification for the different subgroups. It shows that northern cities experience a more significant lockdown effect on air quality compared with the southern cities. The main reason may be attributable to northern cities relying more on coal for electricity and heating. City lockdown significantly reduces people's travel needs and associated consumption in coal for power or heating, which consequently results in the reduction of air pollution. In contrast, the effect becomes less substantial for cities with smaller GDP and population, which is consistent with our expectation that The dependent variable is ln(AQI) in columns (1) to (4) and column (6). ln(AQI_lag) represents the ln(AQI) with 1 day lag *** Significant at 1% ** Significant at 5% * Significant at 10% more agglomerated economies consume more energy.

Elasticity denotes the sensitivity of mortality to a one-unit change in air pollution level; since its estimate is not the focus of interest in this study, we use the estimates from existing researches that provide the estimated effects of changes in air quality on human health. Since the estimated effects may vary over time, researches on this topic using data from earlier years may be less effective as the reference. In addition, in view of the credit of estimates based on quasiexperimental studies compared with those based on associated regression models (Graff Zivin and Neidell 2013), we identify academic articles and book chapters that meet these criteria based on Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and other databases. Finally, two main references are chosen after the article selection. Specially, Fan et al. (2020) , in their empirical study based on a regression discontinuity (RD) analysis, found that a 10-\u03bcg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 would lead to a 2.2% increase in mortality rate. The other one is He et al. (2020b) , who indicated that this rate could reach over 3.25 percent based on an estimation of the effect of straw burning on air pollution and associated health problem in China. Therefore, we set the range of mortality increase as 2.2~3.25% following a 10-\u03bcg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 . BaseMR i represents the annual mortality rate in city i at the base year, and Popu i denotes the population in city i at the same time. Considering the data availability, we set 2018 as the base year of mortality rate and population. The results suggest that the total number of averted premature deaths is around 26,385 to 38,977 due to the air quality improvement during the sample period. Meanwhile, China's total number of deaths attributable to the COVID-19 (4643 as of May 3, 2020 according to the statistics of WHO 9 ) is much less than these numbers. They also reflect the enormous social costs out of air pollution during the normal time.",

Through a quantitative analysis on the effect of pandemic-induced lockdown on the air quality across Chinese 325 cities, this study contributes to the fast-growing literature on COVID-19 pandemic-related shock effects, mostly on changes in air pollution concentration associated with specific causes. Through leveraging daily air quality data and the within-city migration index of 325 cities from January 1 to May 2, 2020, in China, this study discovered that the pandemic-induced lockdown improves urban air quality based on a set of empirical specifications. Specifically, the results showed that the air quality index experiences a 12.2% larger reduction in the cities with lockdown, with the result being statistically significant at the 1% level. With respect to other air pollutants, this reduction effect is 4%, 13.1%, 15.3%, 3.3%, and 3.3% for SO 2 , PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , and CO, respectively. The paper also examined the various effects of lockdowns across different classifications of cities in terms of spatial distribution, income level, and industrial structure. It shows that these effects are more remarkable in northern, higher income, more industrialized, and more economically active cities. Despite the enormous economic and political turmoil created by the pandemic, we may benefit from the improved air quality due to city lockdown in terms of health benefits. The expected averted premature deaths due to air pollution declines are around 26,385 to 38,977 during the sample period. Our findings imply that anthropogenic activities are significantly positively related to the air pollution. Although our results show a temporary air quality improvement resulting from the lockdown, other than AQI, PM 10 , and PM 2.5 , the reduction ratios of the other three air pollutants were small. Therefore, the effectiveness of the driving restriction policy or the license-plate lottery policy that directly bans some vehicles \"_H\" and \"_L\" indicate the \"high\" group and the \"low\" group, respectively. The socio-economic data involved in this table for the classification are measured in 2016 as the base year. Panels (A) to (F) reported the results for AQI, PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , and CO, respectively *** from driving so as to curb the air pollution should be given a comprehensive assessment. Moreover, our findings suggested important policy implications for enforcing environmental regulations such as milder forms of restrictions on human activities to decrease pollution and associated health loss in the post-pandemic period . Future research could explore the specific health benefits from the lockdown-induced changes in air pollution levels, particularly from a long-term perspective. A comparative assessment of the economic damage and health benefits out of this pandemic-induced lockdown would help policymakers to make a rational decision for future air pollution abatement policy formulations (Bherwani et al. 2020 ). This pandemic also provides us a tremendous opportunity for natural experiments to understand how Chinese economy respond to the changes in pollution emission, which could play an important role in guiding the industrial restructuring in the future (Balsalobre-Lorente et al. 2020). Furthermore, the heterogeneity of the reduction effect on different pollutants results from city lockdown also requires further analysis. As the pandemic has spread to more than 200 countries around the world, travel restrictions are also imposed in many other countries; hence, future study could replicate these results in other contexts and unpack the specific channel through which city lockdown affects air pollution.",

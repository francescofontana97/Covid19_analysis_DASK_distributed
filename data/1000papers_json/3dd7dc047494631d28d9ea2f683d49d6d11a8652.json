In an early review from China, it was reported that over 90% of children with COVID-19 had mild or moderate disease, 4.4% were asymptomatic, and very few presented with hypoxia (5.3%) or critical illness (0.6%). 4 It remains unclear whether children are less likely to be infected with COVID-19, if they are infected and manifest less severe disease, or if there is a combined effect. 5 Children have comprised a very small proportion of overall confirmed COVID-19 cases in both Italy and China, with only 1 confirmed death reported. 6, 7 In the United States, as of April 3, only 1.7% of all confirmed cases are children (< 18 years), and children are less likely than adults to have symptoms of fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath. Children are also less likely than adults to be hospitalized or to require intensive care. Thus far, in the United States, there have been 3 pediatric deaths reported and reviews are underway to determine whether the cause of these deaths was indeed COVID-19. 8 As hospitals around the world prepare and respond to this crisis, pediatric centers have been affected to a lesser degree. We aim to describe the stages of pandemic response at 2 major academic freestanding children's hospitals on the West Coast of the United States, to highlight the operational changes implemented and barriers encountered during the response, and to discuss the transition from preparing for a surge of pediatric patients to supporting regional hospitals as pediatric volumes remain low.",

Staff worked together to limit their frequency of entering rooms, and attending physicians coordinated with trainees and advanced practice practitioners to limit patient exams.

They quickly increased capacity, which briefly permitted unrestricted testing. However, due to a swab and universal transport media shortage, testing was prioritized to high-risk patients.

Symptomatic patients with respiratory symptoms would be admitted to the PUI unit prior to test results. Asymptomatic patients requiring admission would also be tested, but, in an effort to conserve PPE, would wait in the ED until COVID-19 results were completed, which has led to lengths of stay between 7 and 20 hours. All non-emergent procedures (operative and interventional radiology) also require COVID-19 testing results prior to the procedure to conserve PPE and equipment for negative patients. Though our microbiology laboratory has actively been ramping up testing and decreasing TAT, requiring test results for this large group of patients has resulted in significant delays, depending on the time that the COVID-19 test was sent. However, given the low census and the overall needs of the hospital, the ED has continued this protocol.",

However, we soon noted the decline in symptomatic patients seeking emergency care. Therefore, on April 6, we changed our zones to have 3 asymptomatic zones and 1 symptomatic zone.",

A small supply of N95 masks was placed by the resuscitation room for emergent use. As staff adopted extended CAPR use, staff already wearing CAPRs responded first to resuscitations so that they can enter the room faster. Iterative simulation was employed to design, test, and orient staff to a modified resuscitation team structure using telehealth equipment. We placed a tablet inside of the room and computer outside of the room to create a 2-way video and audio connection to decrease the number of staff physically in the room, to reduce PPE use, and to limit staff exposures during resuscitations. This decreased the number of staff in the room for resuscitations by approximately 50%-70%. Additional simulations refined the COVID-19 intubation process. We have also been working with Anesthesiology to standardize the process of intubation for a PUI, using extra protective drapes and video laryngoscopy.",

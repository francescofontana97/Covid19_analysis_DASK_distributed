Importantly, that definition goes on to state: \"A disaster is a function of the risk process. It results from the combination of hazards, conditions of vulnerability and insufficient capacity or measures to reduce the potential negative consequences of risk.\" Disasters may occur in many forms (Table 32 .1); in different settings and levels of complexity; with variable amounts of warning and very different consequences for people. The number of natural disasters have increased in the last century and doubled within the last 30 years, with many more people affected. During the same period the proportion of disasters that are manmade has increased from 16.5% in the 1970s to 42% in the 1990s (not including \"complex emergencies\") [3] . As the density of population across the world increases (related both to population growth and increasing urbanization) it is likely that the frequency and impact of disasters will continue to increase. Climate change (with associated extreme weather conditions; change in regional weather and associated change in distribution of pathogens and vectors) is likely to exacerbate this trend.",

Often the environment following a disaster may be highly contaminated (toxins, sewerage, dead bodies, etc.) with limited access to clean water and frequent overcrowding of survivors. In that context infections spread via hands are particularly frequent unless particular attention is paid to hand washing. Many survivors may have wounds, which again have risk of being contaminated, either during the incident or soon thereafter.

A deep concern is that the people and systems that are put in this position are fully competent to deal with children's issues. These concerns arise from the recognition of the following: 1. It is often relatively easy to get resources (often the wrong ones) in the short term, but much more difficult over a longer period of time. 2. The need to get the correct resources, and not what the people in other countries want to give. 3. The need to work out how to deal with \"excess resources\" and make sure that these are not actually sources of development of ongoing crime and corruption.",

However there is considerable evidence of major deficiencies in the training programs for staff who may be required to care for pediatric mass casualties [72] .",

Its labeled indication is for the treatment of malaria. Its use in the Covid-19 is therefore off-label. That is why its use in the context of Covid-19 is rising many controversial questions: Is it ethical not to treat a patient while a treatment exists and is used for other indications than Covid-19 for which it's not proven yet? If yes, is a randomized controlled trial to prove the hydroxychloroquine for the Covid- 19 First of all, randomization is the best way to avoid selection and information bias and equipoise is the main justification for randomization. It could be overlooked only when a treatment is clearly superior, and in this case, randomization will put one group of patients at a disadvantage. Many historical examples for effective treatment were based only on observational studies that were adequate enough to show effectiveness without recourse to randomization, e.g. penicillin for bacterial infections; smallpox vaccination, \u2026",

Based on this conclusion, the question, related to the prescription of this drug as a treatment for covid-19, is not answered yet. However, one could argue that the worldwide emergency, the rapid spread of the disease, and the high rates of disease mortality mainly at the beginning of the pandemic [9] , are sufficient reasons for prescribing this off-label treatment for covid-19 patients. If the answer is yes, there remain the questions of what are the main ethical principles to be applied in this case? and is there other evidence based pathway other than Randomized Clinical Trial to support new purposes of this drug?",

MEURI (Monitored Emergency Use of UnRegistered Interventions) Framework group stated that, in such emergency situation, it can be ethically appropriate to offer individual patients experimental interventions on an emergency basis outside clinical trials [11] . This is even more true when the best available therapeutic option fails, and patients demand new approach or new treatment and physicians promote patients' interests by prescribing products off-label [12] , and also when the use of the \"best available drug\" is supported by some expert opinion [11] , which is the case of the hydroxychloroquine. However, the clinical use of such drugs, should adhere to the MEURI framework [11] and the four principles of medical ethics (respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice) should be respected.",

Having said that, Agarwal propose a pluralistic evidence instead of a Randomized Clinical considering all available sources and types of data, including laboratory studies on mechanisms of action, in vitro experiments on human biopsies, in vivo animal models, quality of life data, clinical trials of offlabel drug use, etc [16] . The pluralistic evidence approach may be feasible and acceptable in the covid-19 pandemic. It can provide: data of sufficient quality to \"fill the evidence gap\" for the efficacy and safety of such off-label medicine, a more complete causal association while minimizing the potential biases, and practitioners can be more confident and less reluctant for its prescription.",

However, at some point in an emergency context, decisions are still very difficult to make especially when it comes to the weight to be given to treat patients in pandemic context compared to other important public health priorities [17] . This should not be a reason to not include clinicians and patients in this decision-making process. Otherwise, this decision may be considered unacceptably paternalistic.",

This challenge is even more complicated in developing countries, considering the context of multicultural specificity (different dialects), medical paternalistic decisions often required by patients, the social vulnerability which is deepened more and more by the pandemic (high level of illiteracy, low socioeconomic level). In addition, because in some countries [6] , the treatment has been recommended for all patients even for those who are asymptomatic, some doctors argued that the treatment should be given only to moderate to critically ill patients. Such targeting of the treatment, however, may be viewed from a public health emergency perspective, as to be less effective in reducing the spread of the disease in the contact patients and the whole population. Such attitude may undermine the public health goal as individual interests outweigh the collective ones.",

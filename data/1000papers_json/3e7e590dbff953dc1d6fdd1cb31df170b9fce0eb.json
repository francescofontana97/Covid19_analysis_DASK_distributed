He did not complain of fever, respiratory symptoms (as cough or dyspnea), headache, malaise, sore throat, nasal congestion or diarrhea. He had no history of family exposure and he was taking strict social distancing measures due to the Spanish Government restrictions applied on 13th March 2020. Physical examination showed edematous and erythematous to violaceous plaques on the dorsal toes of both feet (Fig 1) . These lesions were clinically compatible with chilblains. A nasopharyngeal sample was obtained and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was negative for SARS-CoV-2. Serologic tests Due to known potential thromboembolic complications related to COVID-19, the patient was referred to the Ophthalmology Department, despite being visually asymptomatic and not reporting any ocular complaint. An ophthalmologic exam was performed: his visual acuity was 1 in both eyes, and the pupils were reactive and symmetric. The slit lamp exam showed no pathological findings. An examination of the ocular fundus showed retinal vasculitis located on the equator of the left eye, as well as one perivascular infiltrate as well and extended retinal exudates (Fig 2A and 2B ). The vitreous was clear, and the macular structure was preserved on the optical tomography image. No retinal inflammation was found in the right eye. These findings were compatible with retinal vasculitis.",

These lesions typically occur in asymptomatic and healthy children and young adults. In these patients, chilblains mainly affect the feet, although they can also appear on the hands. Dorsal toes are the most frequently affected and lesions are described as rounded, well-circumscribed erythematous to violaceous plaques or nodules. They can sometimes become bullous. Most of these lesions are asymptomatic; however, some patients have reported pain or pruritus. We suspected these chilblains could be related to COVID-19 because they had arisen along with warm springtime and in clusters during this COVID-19 pandemic.",

Further investigations and prospective studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Meanwhile, dermatologists and other physicians must be alerted to these clinical presentations of COVID-19 infection. These patients need to be immediately tested and isolated to prevent transmission until we can explain the nature of these findings. To date, the pathogenic origin of these types of lesions remains unknown. Due to the clinical and histopathological similarities to chilblains in lupus erythematosus (LE), some authors have mentioned an autoimmune pathogenic mechanism of these COVID-19 features. Some studies in the literature have sustained this autoimmune theory. Recently, a case series of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection strengthens the link between COVID-19 and autoimmunity 5 . Another possible pathogenic mechanism related to these features is the type I interferons (IFN-I) response to coronavirus infection. This type I IFN response is observed in other viral infections, in LE, and in some auto-inflammatory interferonopathies. Among these syndromes, we would like to highlight Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome, STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), familial chilblain lupus, retinal vasculopathy with",

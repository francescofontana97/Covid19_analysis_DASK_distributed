The proteases responsible for virus-cell membrane fusion were expressed but not regulated with remodeling. In addition, a new candidate for CoV-2 cell binding and entry was identified, the integrin ITGA5.

The prevalence of cardiac complications in patients without underlying heart disease ranges from 20-30% (7) (8) (9) , which when present worsens prognosis. In the initial report of patients receiving intensive care, evidence of cardiac injury was associated with a 50% mortality compared to <10% without such evidence (3) .

In addition, there are other possible mechanisms of virus internalization such as binding to integrins (16, 17) , some of which also bind to ACE2 (18, 19) . Although CoV-2-cell internalization has been investigated in model systems (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) and is beginning to be evaluated in the human heart (20) it is unclear if the virus enters human cardiac myocytes, and if the necessary biologic constituents are expressed in the heart. Of particular importance is the role of ACE2; in human ventricular myocardium ACE2 is a highly functional enzyme present in cardiac myocytes (20) that breaks down angiotensin II (ANG II) to the counter-regulatory peptide angiotensin-(1-7) (21,22). In explanted human heart preparations from patients with end stage reduced ejection fraction heart failure (HFrEF), ACE2 enzyme activity (22) as well as gene expression at the mRNA (20,23) and protein (20,22) levels are upregulated compared to organ donor controls. This is potentially important because upregulated ACE2 might be a mechanism by which CoV-2 myocardial involvement is more prominent in patients with underlying heart muscle disease (20).",

The only integrin that achieved unequivocal evidence of remodeling association was the laminin binding cardiac and skeletal muscle integrin ITGA7, which has not been reported to bind to ACE2 or pathogenic viruses and which, like ACE2 and NPPB, can be viewed in a counter-regulatory context (37) . Five of the ten integrins evaluated contained motifs for binding to an RGD domain, common in pathogenic viruses as a means of cell surface binding and virus internalization, and recently identified in CoV-2 (16) . Of these, only ITGA5 and ITGB3 were up-regulated, meaning if Cov-2 did utilize RGD-integrin binding for internalization these two monomers might predispose to greater cell entry. However, these integrins do not dimerize with each other (44) , and the ITGA5-ITGB1 or ITGAV-ITGB3 protein product heterodimers, both commonly used by pathogenetic viruses for cell entry, would need to be formed. If RGD binding is disregarded (17) , the other up-regulated integrin (rated as possible evidence) was ITGA4, which also doesn't dimerize with ITGB3 (44) . Alternatively, upregulated integrins could affect virus replication in cardiac myocytes via interaction with integrin linked kinase (45), a pseudokinase adaptor molecule known to bind to ITGB1 and ITGB3 (46) .",

We show that ACE2 is upregulated in eccentrically remodeled/failing LVs, and then decreases expression with reverse remodeling. This regulatory behavior was independent of RAS inhibitors as doses of ACEIs or ARBs weren't different in patients that reverse remodeled compared to those that didn't. ACE2's remodeling expression behavior was identical to NPPB, another counter-regulatory gene that leads to generation of the antiproliferative vasodilator peptide BNP. Upregulated ACE2 should be viewed as beneficial to a remodeled, failing heart, although it may increase the risk of CoV-2 cell invasion and cytopathology. It stands that any therapeutic approach involving ACE2 should focus on inhibiting CoV-2 binding, while maintaining enzyme activity.",

MYH6, PLN and ADRB1 all had remodeling associated ratings of evidence (P <0.002), while ATP2A2 (Serca 2a) rated possible evidence.IntegrinsReverse remodeling changes in integrins are given inTables 2 and S4. For the P <0.05 baseline changed genes, ITGB3, ITGB6 and ITGA5 had at least one platform showing significant change on reverse remodeling and thus qualified for evidence of a remodeling association(Table 3). ITGA4 and ITGA6 expression did not significantly change on reverse remodeling, and their baseline changes therefore qualified as possible evidence. For ITGA7, both microarray and RNA-Seq data met criteria for dynamic downregulation of the baseline upregulated expression and a rating of unequivocal evidence of a remodeling association, with a pattern identical to ACE2 and NPPB. Thus, of the ten integrins examined five had at least some evidence of an association with remodeling.DISCUSSIONIn patients with mild-moderate F/NDC, myocardial ACE2 gene expression dynamically regulates with LV remodeling independent of RAS inhibitor treatment, and may explain heightened COVID-19 clinical risk associated with underlying heart muscle disordersFigure 4illustrates the positioning and role of ACE2 within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

Figures 2 and 3 show the parameter estimates for the 50 \u00d7 50 subset of countries with most infections. The number of non-zero coefficients in A 1 by country ranges from 1 to 32 (out of 100), while the total number is 1741 (out of 10,000). Similarly, the number of non-zero coefficients in A 2 ranges from 6 to 35, with a total number of 1614 non-zero coefficients. In a second step, the coefficient \u03c1 of the spatial error component model in Equation (4) is estimated by Gaussian maximum likelihood, see e.g., Bivand et al. (2013) [23] . The model obviously depends on the specification of the spatial weights matrix W, for which we used inverse distances modulated by the relative population sizes, as in Equation (3). Distances are measured as the geographic distance in kilometers on the WGS ellipsoid between the centroids of two countries. This specification led to the highest likelihood among a set of alternative specifications including unweighted inverse distances, k-nearest neighbor and contiguity matrices. We obtain an estimate of 0.2805 with associated standard error of 0.0518, which suggests that spatial correlation is highly significant and important to be included in the subsequent analysis.

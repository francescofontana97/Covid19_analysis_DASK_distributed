On the 16 th of March, the Swiss Federal Council declared an 'extraordinary situation' and introduced stringent regulations to slow down the spread of the virus [COVID-19 Ordinance 2; 4] during the so-called first wave; citizens were advised to stay home whenever possible and gatherings of more than five individuals were prohibited shortly thereafter. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was not confined to people's working and social lives, however. First and foremost, it affected their access to health care, including psychiatric care. Following the declaration of the 'extraordinary situation', medical treatment providers, including psychiatrists and psychotherapists, were obliged by the government not to offer treatment that was not considered to be medically urgent in order to decelerate the spread of the virus [5] . At the same time, psychiatrists and psychotherapists had a duty to maintain psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care of the Swiss population by delivering indicated treatment that could not be delayed [see e.g. 6].",

In other words, psychiatrists and psychotherapists were advised to resort to telepsychiatric treatment whenever possible, even though this form of treatment provision was only partially reimbursed by health insurers [9] . If on-site treatment was necessary and unavoidable, significant changes to the course of a session had to be made. Based on the recommendations of the Federal Office of Public Health and the FMPP [10], the internal regulations of the outpatient clinic in which the present study was conducted included: (1) following hygiene rules before the session (supervised hand disinfection and temperature measurement including a check for symptoms of a possible COVID-19 infection at the entrance of the building), (2) observing distancing rules during the session, and (3) the therapist wearing a face mask during the session. Thus, continuing psychiatric or psychotherapeutic treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic required substantial changes to the way sessions were usually conducted, either by resorting to telepsychiatry or by making significant adjustments to on-site sessions.",

In addition to telepsychiatry, on-site sessions are also conceivable, especially if face masks are used in addition to strict adherence to hygiene and distance rules. While questions relating to the potential effects wearing face masks might have on therapy sessions and the therapeutic relationship have been discussed in recent Letters to the Editor [11] [12] [13] [14] and discussion papers [15] , little is known about their actual impact. A randomised controlled trial from Hong Kong in 2011, which examined patients' reaction to their general practitioner wearing a face mask during the consultation, found negative effects on patients' perception of the general practitioner's empathy, an effect that was more pronounced for more established general practitioner-patient relationships [16] . We are not aware of a study that has investigated psychiatric outpatients' experience of the session or the therapeutic relationship when the therapist is wearing a face mask.",

Also, patients seem to be as satisfied with tele-mental health interventions as they are with in-person treatment [25, see also e.g. 26] . Some therapists, however, have expressed concerns that the lack of physical interaction in a telepsychiatric setting could hinder the development of a healthy therapeutic alliance (TA) [see e.g. 27] , which is often conceptualised as (1) an emotional bond between patient and therapist and (2) collaboration and consensus between the two parties on the goals and tasks of the therapy [28] . A thorough understanding of the impact of treatment modality on TA is essential given that TA has been found to be one of the strongest predictors of treatment outcome in face-to-face psychotherapy [29, 30] ; despite this, the specific relevance of TA and its individual sub-components in telepsychiatric settings still warrants further investigation [31, 32] . Reviews of the literature suggest, however, that concerns about TA in telepsychiatry may be unfounded. Patients' ratings of TA are fairly comparable for in-person and telepsychiatric interventions, for both video therapy [33] and therapy delivered via telephone [34] , although results from the latter review may have been influenced by the fact that most of the studies included used non-randomised opportunity samples.",

Some adults with ADHD succeed in developing compensation strategies to mitigate the impact of their symptoms on their work and social life [50] . However, these strategies may no longer be sufficient in situations of exceptional stress, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely disrupted people's everyday routine (e.g. introduction of home office or home schooling).

Moreover, the setting in itself, using a media device like a smart phone or computer, might lead to patients carrying out activities simultaneously to the psychotherapeutic session. Thus, we see tangible risks for increased distractibility with this form of psychotherapy in this specific group of patients. On the other hand, telepsychiatric interventions could counteract the negative effects of patients' disorganisation, e.g. by saving travel time and thus alleviating experiences of stress due to difficulties in time management [52] . Furthermore, adults with ADHD may experience a range of financial problems [53] , and telepsychiatry would allow those affected to save on costs associated with traveling to the therapy sessions.

We intended to address two questions in particular. First, does telepsychiatric treatment offer a viable (temporary) alternative to face-to-face treatment in adult ADHD? As discussed, this question is important as several symptoms often associated with ADHD might result in telepsychiatry being particularly challenging for these patients. Second, how does on-site treatment with the therapist wearing a face mask compare to telepsychiatric treatment options? We are not aware of a comparative study investigating this question.

Our results indicate that patients who attended a face-to-face session with the therapist wearing a face mask experienced significantly more depth to their session than patients who received telepsychiatric care. Descriptively, depth was lowest in the video-conferencing group, but further exploratory analyses suggested that depth in that group increased with the number of sessions. Thus, over time the difference in session depth between modalities might decline, which would be in line with the findings reported by Morgan and colleagues [70] , who did not observe statistically significant differences in session depth for telemental health vs face-to-face psychological or psychiatric services. We can only speculate about possible explanations for an initially lower session depth rating in the telepsychiatry group.

Due to ADHD's high prevalence in adults, often demanding continuous treatment, and its frequent presentation with severe psychiatric comorbidities, patients with ADHD are a particularly important group to study. This research offers a valuable contribution to that still understudied topic. While our ADHD sample was comparable in terms of certain aspects such as comorbidity of major mood-disorders [e.g. 71], the comorbidity of substance abuse was lower than what has been reported in other studies [72, 73] . Moreover, the number of patients with high educational achievements was above average. These aspects should be taken into account in terms of the generalisability of the findings to other patients with ADHD.",

First findings on the impact of such adjustments reported in the study at hand are encouraging; both options -on-site with the therapist wearing a mask and telepsychiatry -seem viable alternatives for continuing therapies during a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Although telepsychiatric sessions, particularly those involving videoconferencing, were experienced as less deep by the participants, no differences were observed in post-session positivity, and the difference concerning depth might decline over time. Also, no differences in terms of client satisfaction or TA as perceived by both patient and therapist were observed. While the majority of patients would prefer an on-site solution that does not involve the therapist wearing a face mask, patients' comments on the on-site session focused more on positive elements such as being able to attend the session/speak to their therapist rather than on issues related to the therapist wearing a face mask. Therapists seemed to be more concerned about potential negative impacts of the masks, and a similar observation was made regarding the lack of visual cues in telephone sessions.",

Conversely, if the topic is more general in nature (e.g. discussing medication), a telepsychiatric solution could be considered. Second, does the session contain therapeutic elements, such as drawing up plans and using whiteboards, that may be difficult or impossible to implement in a telepsychiatric setting and would not having access to these elements be particularly detrimental to the session (aims)? This is particularly relevant to sessions over the phone; advances in technology may make this question obsolete if videoconferencing is used and both parties are technically sufficiently skilled. Finally, some patients mentioned a lack of (physical and/or temporal) distance to their everyday life if the session was off-site. It may therefore be helpful to advise patients to take a short break (e.g. from working from home) prior to their telepsychiatric appointment or go to a specific location (e.g. separate room or place) when participating in a therapy session.",

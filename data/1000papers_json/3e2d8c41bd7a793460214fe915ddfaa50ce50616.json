We developed a methodology to assess the public's contribution through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in developing sofosbuvir. Using key terms from the timeline of sofosbuvir, we identified articles in PubMed; linked them to federal funding using the NIH RePORTER; reviewed the title, organization, and investigator of each resulting award for relatedness; and converted related awards to 2018 US dollars. Of 6043 unique awards, we identified 29 directly (N = US$7.7 million) and 110 indirectly (N = US$53.2 million) related awards dispersed to important academic institutions and companies engaged in the development of the drug. These findings indicate that public funding had a key role in developing sofosbuvir, with an estimated US$60.9 million provided in NIH funding.",

However, controversy arose when its manufacturer launched the drug at US$84 000 per course of therapy, or US$1000 per pill [3] . During its first year on the market, sofosbuvir cost the US healthcare system nearly US$8 billion dollars [4] . Although prices have since fallen with the introduction of other direct-acting antivirals, Medicaid (the state-and federal-supported health insurance program for lowincome patients) spent US$12 billion on HCV drugs from 2014 to 2017, which amounted to 5% of the total spending of the program for all outpatient prescriptions during that period [5] .",

A US Government investigation found that Pharmasset spent US$62.4 million (US$70 million after adjusting for inflation) developing sofosbuvir [4] . Although most of these funds originated from early-phase private investors, the start-up also received direct support from the Federal Government. Six highly related awards were directed to Pharmasset [62] . However, once better infrastructure is developed to adequately track Government investment, this tool could be used for other drugs.",

Another recent proposal aims to ensure drugs developed with Federal funding are affordable and accessible by preventing companies from exclusively licensing drugs used to treat or prevent COVID-19 [63, 64] . Although the proposal only covers drugs developed in the context of COVID-19, it could be expanded to include other drugs, such as transformative drugs or those essential to the public health. In the case of sofosbuvir, the drug was taken to the cusp of FDA approval by public funding and private support of Pharmasset, and patients and payors could have benefited from limitations on pricing the drug.",

For example, we did not consider NIH awards to Emory's Center for AIDS research that supported the Virology Core led by Schinazi or the Drug Discovery Core led by Liotta, which received nearly US $2.5 million during the years the amounts were reported.",

First, by identifying articles through PubMed using key terms, we were only able to identify awards that resulted in a publication. Thus, while academics are incentivized to publish their work, researchers at start-up or spinoff companies might not have the same incentive, meaning that the costly failures in basic and translational research are not considered by this method. Second, the search terms selected might have unnecessarily limited the resulting articles in PubMed, which in turn would limit the awards linked through the NIH RePORTER. Third, the award titles and abstract provided in the NIH RePORTER were sometimes vague, making relatedness classifications difficult, or the amount of the award was not provided. Fourth, of the different agencies that provide data on awards to the NIH RePORTER, those agencies provided data during different time periods; for example, the VA provided data only from 2009 onwards, meaning that we could not account for any financial support from the VA in our estimate [10].",

The NIH estimates that it has invested > US$1 billion dollars in small businesses (e.g., R43 awards), including Pharmasset, to commercialize research [59]. This policy has been criticized as NIH's 'socialization of risk with privatization of gains' in drug development [60]. Precisely estimating federal funding remains difficult, and it is more challenging when funding amounts do not appear for related awards in the NIH RePORTER. One award still lists a nominal funding amount of US$1. To shed more light on what the Federal Government invested in Pharmasset, we submitted a Freedom of Information Act Request to the NIH about this US$1 award in 2006. Upon receipt of the cover page and subsequent progress report of the award for the year in question, it appears the award amount for that year amounted to US$338 736 [61]. Thus, it remains difficult to estimate NIH funding when award amounts are not readily accessible.

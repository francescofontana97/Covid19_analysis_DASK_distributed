The pharmaceutical supply chain involves some level of commingling of a collection of stakeholders such as distributors, manufacturers, wholesalers, and customers. The biggest challenge associated with this supply chain is temperature monitoring as well as counterfeit drug prevention. Many drugs and vaccines remain viable within a specific range of temperatures. If exposed beyond this temperature range, the medicine no longer works as intended. In this paper, an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor-based blockchain framework is proposed that tracks and traces drugs as they pass slowly through the entire supply chain. On the one hand, these new technologies of blockchain and IoT sensors play an essential role in supply chain management. On the other hand, they also pose new challenges of security for resource-constrained IoT devices and blockchain scalability issues to handle this IoT sensor-based information. In this paper, our primary focus is on improving classic blockchain systems to make it suitable for IoT based supply chain management, and as a secondary focus, applying these new promising technologies to enable a viable smart healthcare ecosystem through a drug supply chain.",

            "text": "Transportation of pharmaceuticals (drugs, vaccines, supplies) from manufacturer to patient follows a stringent supply chain. The critical challenge of this supply chain management is safe transportation. The healthcare industry has an increasing number of counterfeit drugs on the market, and one in ten medical products are falsified in most developing countries. These medicines contain an incorrect ingredient or no active ingredient. Take for example, the current global pandemic of COVID-19. A British Broadcasting Channel (BBC) News investigation found fake drugs for sale in Africa, where counterfeiters are exploiting growing gaps in the market. The World Health Organization (WHO) said taking these drugs could have \"serious side effects\" [1] . The other key challenge is many pharmaceuticals are supposed to remain viable or effective only within a certain range of temperatures. If the temperature becomes too hot or cold, these medicines become ineffective, thus do not work as they are intended to. Being able to verify the temperature conditions and authenticity of medicines allow medical professional or patients to discard medicines that are no longer active or effective. When proper medication is found, the supply chain of that medication will need to be monitored closely both for the authenticity of medication as well as if any of the useful ingredients The QR code stores all necessary information regarding sensor, temperature range, temperature threshold, owner information, etc. The QR code has two blank information cells (low temperature and high temperature). During transit, if the temperature changes beyond a given threshold for that particular drug, then it stores that temperature in the QR code blank cells. The sensor also shows a red light if the temperature has ever gone beyond the threshold and blinks green if the temperature has remained under the threshold. Once delivery is completed, sensor data can be transferred to the cloud using QR code Readers (see Figure 2 ) and the hash of the QR code is stored in a blockchain. Nowadays, handheld smartphone devices are predominantly used as a QR code scanner and reader. However, the security of these sensor devices is another issue. Therefore, we need some digital signature scheme to confirm that the data is not modified by the attacker. The other issue with sensor networks is time synchronization of all sensors. Any form of sensor data fusion requires a synchronized clock. The problem of time synchronization in sensor networks was briefly described in the article [9] . To address the problem of time synchronization in sensor networks, the Berkeley algorithm [10] is one of the famous algorithms developed by Gusella and Zatti at the University of California, Berkeley.",

            "text": "One of the well-known drawbacks of blockchain technology is the scalability of the network. Scalability is defined as one of the most vital problems in blockchain technology and has been a prime focus in the blockchain community since its onset. The integration of IoT devices to the blockchain is challenging. IoT devices generate a large amount of data, and blockchains cannot handle them due to their low throughput or transaction execution rate. There are quite a few consensus algorithms available for blockchain that support high throughput; however, they require extremely high-performance for the network. In the proposed model, we used Raft consensus algorithms that provide high throughput, but Raft is only suitable for a small number of participants in the network. Increasing the nodes in the network decreases the efficiency and throughput of Raft due to low network scalability. The Raft algorithm expects very fast data transmission to provide high throughput. Therefore, we increase network performance by using the bloXroute [11] server concept. These bloXroute servers propagate the blocks very fast in the network. However, the bloXroute server propagates only encrypted blocks that prevent it from stopping the block propagation based on its content, and therefore node discrimination is not possible by servers. Please note that bloXroute is not a blockchain itself but it is a highly scalable distributed network only. Collecting encrypted data from resource-constrained devices, for example, the QR code scanner, is also a major issue. Currently, many applications like sensor networks or RFID are implemented on devices with very limited capabilities, and they require lightweight encryption. Many well-known standard algorithms, for example, AES, do not stand up to the basic requirements of constrained devices. This includes the need for minimal cost hardware implementation, minimal power usage, and minimal latency. In response to these problems, lightweight cryptographic primitives have been proposed in this model. These algorithms are usually smaller and faster for IoT based software implementation. Another major issue in need of addressing is the security of sensor devices with lightweight digital signature schemes. To know if the sensor data is coming from a reliable source, a digital signature can play an important role.",

Blockchains can be simplified in description to a distributed ledger, which can be append-only. There is no central authority who controls the data. All nodes in the network come to a consensus to verify a set of data that is saved in a block. Once a block of data is verified, it is appended to a chain of blocks. These blocks are connected by hash, and due to the use of hash and cryptographic signatures, it is almost very tough to alter data. This data chain is also called a blockchain, and the copies of this blockchain are stored at many places and therefore easy to access by anyone in the world. Each block (see Figure 4 ) in the network consists of Transactions and other information, such as Block Header and Merkle Root. Each block in the blockchain is identified by the hash, which is saved in the header. The first block of the chain is called Genesis. In order to integrate the blockchain with IoT devices, our primary goal is to build a scalable distributed network that provides high throughput. ",

Later we will discuss that these parameters cannot be changed arbitrarily. Due to the limited P2P propagation capacity, it is practically infeasible to increase the block size. The current processor maximum throughput is 1000 TPS while input-output disk can support 10 times of processors TPS. After mining a new block, the miner propagates the block for verification across all the network. In general, a peer-to-peer network consists of several nodes, and because of the slowest computer in the P2P network, it might be possible that the propagation speed is slow (see Figure 5 ).

This is because the miners have not yet got the latest mined block (see Figure 6 ). Hence, the block propagates time that is needed by a new block to reach it throughout the whole blockchain network, which opens the opportunity window where forks may occur. In other words, the longer the propagation time, the higher the probability that the fork will occur.

All the nodes in the network have three states: Leader, Follower or Candidate. Only one node can be a leader at a time. A leader node handles all the communication from the client and follower node response to incoming RPCs. The follower waits for an incoming message from the leader, and if not received, the follower assumes that the leader is dead (see Figure 9 ). A new leader is chosen on the basis of a new election. The same blockchain ledger can be used by many organizations and in cases where organizational groups want to hide data from other groups, in such cases, we need separate channels to store the data of different groups of organizations. Creating separate channels causes additional overhead (maintaining separate chains of blocks). Hyperledger Fabric offers the ability to create such kinds of separate channels or private data collections called chaincodes. Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation, which provides a collaborative environment for a permissioned blockchain. Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain that allows various components, such as consensus algorithm and membership services to plug and play. Fabric currently powers more than 400 prototypes and proofs-of-concept of distributed ledger technology and several production systems, across different industries and use cases. Hyperledger Fabric is the best choice for the B2B supply chain services that use a Raft consensus algorithm for higher throughput.",

In this process of packaging, counterfeit products can be merged at any level. The proposed framework (see Figure 11 ) is to create a blockchain and IoT based system that records and timestamps the transfer of goods at each point in the supply chain management. As the products and vaccines travel through the supply chain, every transaction of pharmaceutical products and vaccines should be timestamped with the current supply chain owner. The ledger stored in the blockchain is used to ensure the security and safety of the products. The patients, hospitals or pharmacy, anyone can access the full history of the products they received. The other key challenge is that many products like vaccines are viable with a certain temperature range, and in case there would be a break in the cold chain, the medicine becomes no longer active. Several solutions exist in the literature to prevent these risks, such as the use of refrigerated vehicles or use of thermoboxes/isothermal boxes. These isothermal boxes contain eutectic plates that allow constant cold diffusion to maintain a uniform temperature level. However, monitoring of temperature is still a big challenge.

In the last few years, several companies have introduced new QR codes that have more security features. In the proposed model, we recommend the use of digital watermark based clone proof QR codes (see [32] ), known as AR Codes. The QR code provided by them is clone-proof and provides a solution for trace and track and anti-counterfeiting. The QR code can be scanned using a normal mobile phone by using a mobile application or web application. Once the manufacturer produces the final product in a large extent and bundles them in packages, a QR code is created, which adds batch number and certificate of origin to these packages. Generally, in the case of self-certification, the manufacturer issues the electronic certificate of origin, and this certificate is also added to the blockchain. However, if third-party certification is required, first the certificate must be signed by the manufacturer and then countersigned by a local issuing body, such as a chamber of commerce (board of trade) or customs authority. All products that are packed under one manufacturer should have the same batch number. During the transit of packages in the supply chain, once the package is shipped from manufacturer to distributor or from distributor to retailer, it is scanned through a QR code reader. If the QR code information does not match the condition, for example, overheated temperature of vaccines or batch number modified, then the receiver does not accept the package (see Figure 13 ).",

With the growing number of resource-constrained devices in IoT, it becomes challenging to choose the encryption scheme based on system requirements.

In public-key cryptosystems, separate key pairs are used to sign and verify the data. The signer uses a private key to create a digital signature and receiver uses the signer's public key to verify the digital signature. Another good alternative is to create a digital signature by using a hash function (see Figure 16 ). The digital ring signature provides two important security properties: Signers anonymity and Signers correctness. The signer uses session key K session (key is already exchanged using ECDH over an insecure channel) and generates the hash value of the document. Similarly, the receiver also generates the hash value of the received copy with the same session key K session . If both hash values match, then the data is not modified.",

Data integrity guarantees that the data is not being tempered. Quick response code (QR code) security guarantees that the codes cannot be cloned and tempered by any defaulter. There are some other security requirements such as privacy, anonymity, and scalability that make the system model better and therefore, can also be used for the more general case. In Table 4 , we present how we address these security requirements. We considered a few attacks that could be possible in this model and find a security margin against them in our model. Security is evaluated in our blockchain-based model based on the three categories: Adversaries can be a trader who change the sensor data, blockchain server or a malicious node from the blockchain network. These adversaries can create false transactions, delete or change information, replicate fake nodes, discard transactions or modify watermarks. P2P nodes perform auditing in the server, and therefore, without discrimination, the server can propagate all blocks to gateways. However, except sensor tempering, we mainly focus on blockchain network security because once the data is stored in the blockchain, it enjoys the security properties of a distributed network.",

Blockade of IL-10 using antibody against 270 IL-10 or its receptor or genetic removal of IL-10 resulted in elimination of infection by 271 virus(61-63) or bacterial pathogen(64). Thus the elevated levels of IL-10 in severe 272 COVID-19 patients was initially ascribed to a negative feedback mechanism through its 273 anti-inflammatory activities(34). 274 However, in other contexts IL-10 was also observed to have an immuno-stimulatory 275 effect. Administration of recombinant IL-10 caused elevation in levels of LPS-induced 276 IFN-\u03b3 release in healthy volunteers(65), and levels of phytohaemagglutinin-induced 277 IFN-\u03b3 in moderate Crohn's Disease patients(66). In view of its pro-inflammatory nature, 278 Lu et al(67) have proposed a two-stage participatory role of IL-10 in COVID-19 disease 279 progression. At the initiation of viral infection, IL-10 acts as a countermeasure to the 280 pro-inflammatory modulators in a negative feedback mechanism. However, with 281 progression of the disease endogenous level of IL-10 increases bringing into action its 282 proinflammatory aspect and making contribution to the raging cytokine storm. 283However, this remains a hypothetical mechanism that needs to be tested in detailed 284 longitudinal studies. 285 IL-4 is another cytokine, originally discovered as a B-cell growth factor assisting 286 production of antibodies(68), that was found to suppress the levels of pro-inflammatory 287 cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in PBMC isolated from healthy volunteers(69-288 71). Similar anti-inflammatory nature of IL-4 was also observed in a mouse model of 289 arthritis(72). Studies with transgenic mice and further reviews have suggested 290 differential effects of IL-4 on different T-cell populations that can affect T-cell 291 infiltration and viral clearance for infections(73,74). However, our meta-analysis failed 292 to establish any significant difference of IL-4 level between severe and non-severe 293 patients, probably indicating a less prominent role of IL-4 in the acute inflammatory 294 phase of Though the levels of cytokines are increased in severe COVID-19 patients, it's 296 implication in a therapeutic perspective remains unclear. Corticosteroids that can on COVID-19 patients. The RECOVERY trial with 2104 patients receiving 299Dexamethasone compared to 4321 patients with standard-of-care showed that 300 Dexamethasone reduces mortality in severe patients with invasive ventilation or 301 oxygen support, but did not have any effect on patients with mild symptoms(75). 302However, a meta-analysis across studies involving infection of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 303 and MERS-CoV showed increased mortality risk ratio (RR 2.11, 95% CI: 1.13 -3.94) for 304 patients treated with corticosteroids(76).Theoharides and Conti(77)  argued that use of 305 dexamethasone as immunosuppressor may be beneficial in the short-term for severe 306 COVID-19 patients but in the long-term it would negatively affect recovery due to the 307 damaging effect of dexamethasone on protective function of T-cells and on antibody 308 generation ability of B cells. 309In an unique study, anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody drug, infliximab, was administered to a small310 group (n = 7) of severe COVID-19 patients without any pre-existing auto-immune 311 condition(78). Though the patients showed decrease in IL-6 level and increase in 312 lymphocyte count post-administration, the cohort size was not adequate to make any 313 conclusion on the end-point benefits. Few other studies used etanercept(79), 314 adalimumab(80) and infliximab(81) therapy successfully for COVID-19 patients, but 315 with pre-existing auto-immune conditions. On the other hand, there have been several 316 studies targeting IL-6 levels using siltuximab, an IL-6 inhibitor or tocilizumab, an IL-6 317 receptor inhibitor in severe COVID-19 patients. A retrospective analysis of 88 COVID-19 318 pneumonia patients who received at list one dose of tocilizumab showed clinical 319 improvement in 44% and 74% patients by day 7 and day 14 respectively(82), though 320 without any control group in the study. However a placebo controlled trial with 243 321 moderately ill and hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received either a single dose of 322 tocilizumab (n = 161) or placebo (n = 82) did not indicate any efficacy for tocilizumab to 323 prevent intubation or death(83). A recent review (84) on few such studies did not 324 reveal any conclusive benefits due to lack of appropriate control groups in design or 325 inadequate statistical significance. Further, the timing for anti-IL-6 agent administration 326 remains critical since an early administration may negatively affect the innate response, 327 while the late administration may not yield desired benefits. Some of the ongoing 328 clinical results using anti-IL-6 therapy will shed more light in near future. 329 Therapeutic strategy of targeting IL-10 has been a nascent topic for infective diseases(LCMV) infected mice when treated with anti-IL-10 antibody 334 exhibited enhanced T-cell responses resulting in increased IFN-\u03b3 production and 335 reduction in viral load(61). Blockade of IL-10 signalling using an antibody that targets 336 IL-10 receptor also reduced viral titre and persistence in LCMV-infected mice(62,63). 337 On the other hand, studies with administration of recombinant IL-10 or its pegylated 338 form in cancer patients showed an escalation in CD8+ T-cell response manifested by 339 increase of serum IFN-\u03b3(86,87). Such promiscuity of IL-10 both as an immune-response 340 suppressor as well as an immuno-stimulator renders it as an unreliable drug target in 341 any disease context. 342 Despite the unclarity on therapeutic potential of IL-6 and IL-10, their observed levels of 343 elevation in severe COVID-19 patients have prompted clinical researchers to explore 344 use of them as prognosticators. In an earlier study with pneumonia-affected children, 345 IL-6/IL-10 ratio on admission was found to be an indicator of severe disease with 346 sensitivity and specificity of 76.5% and 83.3% respectively (57). In COVID-19 context, 347 ROC curve analysis on an Italian cohort of 77 patients showed IL-6 as a prognostic 348 factor for combined end-point of progression to severe disease and/or in-hospital 349 mortality with AUC = 0.8(19). However, performance of prognosis for progression to 350 severe disease was poorer with AUC = 0.75. In the recently reported meta-analysis over 351 a large number of studies, classifier performance was found to be higher for neutrophil 352 count (AUC = 0.831), lymphocyte (AUC = 0.867) and D-dimer (AUC = 0.876) than using 353 IL-6 as covariate(AUC = 0.632)(13). Another research with 102 COVID-19 patients used 354 logistic regression to evaluate potential of multiple cytokines to diagnose severe and 355 critical patients(20). Results revealed best prognostic performance for IL-6 (AUC = 356 0.83), followed by IL-10 (AUC = 0.73) as individual covariates whereas the model with 357 all cytokines showed marginally better performance (AUC 0.86, sensitivity 80.0%, 358 specificity 75.9%). A more recent study with 80 COVID-19 patients established a 359 prognostic score with the slope of IL-6:IL-10 ration over the study period of 7 days 360 predicting decline in condition of patients at an improved classifier performance (AUC > 0.95) than using IL-6 level alone for prognosis(88). All of these results support our 362 finding of both IL-6 and IL-10 as prognosticator for severe COVID-19 disease. 363 Other than these cytokines, D-Dimer, CRP level and NLR are explored as diagnostic or 364 prognostic markers in COVID-19. Though a couple of studies focused only on their 365 diagnostic potential for COVID-19 positivity(89,90), ROC analysis in a study with 84 366 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia(91) showed modest performance of 367 NLR and CRP to predict a 7-day endpoint as AUC values of 0.69 (CRP), 0.76 (NLR) and 368 0.080 (both). Another study with 191 confirmed COVID-19 patients(90) established a 369 slightly higher performance with AUC values as 0.84(NLR) and 0.71(CRP) to distinguish 370 severe and non-severe patients. Pooled ROC curve analysis in a couple of meta-analysis 371 studies showed modest classifier performance for CRP and D-Dimer with AUC values as 372 0.84 and 0.69(92) and 0.88 and 0.77(93) respectively to discriminate severe and non-373 sever patients. Since in all these cases the AUC values are below 0.9, predictive values 374 for NLR, CRP and D-Dimer to diagnose severe patients may remain restricted. A recent 375 proteomics study(94) predicted excellent classification performance (AUC = 0.96) for 376 severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients using 22 serum proteins and 7 metabolites as 377 covariates. However, a proteomics infrastructure is not so common in a clinic, limiting 378 clinical utility of this test. 379 In this context, results of the meta-analysis and classification obtained in this study 380 assumes importance in multiple aspects. Firstly, synthesis of a large number of studies 381 (more than many of the cited meta-analyses) demonstrates a significant difference in 382 values for only two cytokines -IL-6 and IL-10 with counter-acting mechanisms, 383 reaffirming the dysregulation of immune response in progression to a severe state. 384 Secondly, even at the absence of individual patient data, ROC curve analysis with mean 385 values of IL-6 and IL-10 levels manifests a high level of classifier performance (AUC > 386 0.9) in distinguishing severe from non-severe group patients, which is higher than 387 classifier performance from individual studies(19,20). Our results are likely to be more 388 robust since variations from multiple patient cohorts are included in this synthesis. And 389 lastly, it opens the possibility of further research to establish a validated diagnostic test 390 using these two markers for management of COVID-19 patients. Since we are working 391 with mean values of markers in severe or non-severe patient groups and not individual 392 patient-level values, we have refrained from using IL-6/IL-10 ratio as the classifier as was done in the pneumonia study(57). However, availability of patient data from 394 multiple cohorts of severe and non-severe patients can firmly establish and validate the 395 test with the ratio or any other transform as the basis of classification. 396 Conclusion 397 Our findings, summarized over multiple studies, indicate a possible dysregulation in 398 immune response against COVID-19, characterized by two cytokines IL-6 and IL-10, 399 shifts the balance between non-severe to severe category of patients, and hence 400 measurement of both markers is necessary to demarcate the boundary. Measurement of 401 serum levels IL-6 and IL-10 are inexpensive and can be performed on admission to 402 clinics or care centres with minimum facilities. Such measurement will be key to 403 identify patients with a greater likelihood of progression to severe disease and thereby 404 to adopt necessary precautionary measures. 405 Further trials with multiple cohorts of COVID-19 patients or assimilation of patient-406 level data from existing cohorts will be needed to establish and validate the test. Other 407 than the diagnostic potential, option of possible therapeutic strategy targeting either IL-408 6 or IL-10 or both is likely to emerge through analysis of such data.

This has been particularly highlighted in environmental policy, given the rise of paradigms like 'One Health' that centre the interconnectedness of human health and the environment, and that have given conservation organisations a seat at the table in global health. For those communities of practice, COVID-19 has underscored issues with the sustainability and safety of contact between humans and wildlife, and concerns about how unsustainable practices could contribute to the future emergence of novel coronaviruses or similar pandemic threats. [1] [2] [3] More broadly, these conversations have pointed to a broader need to address the upstream drivers of poor health and disease burden outside of pandemic settings. In the One Health or planetary health tradition, pandemics can be viewed the product of several proximate drivers (eg, climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation), all of which share an ultimate cause: the explosion of consumption, and destruction of the natural world, caused by capitalism, globalisation, colonialism and neoliberal economic policies. Insufficiently addressed by national and international policies to date (and, possibly, by proposed solutions for future sustainable growth), 4 this process has pushed civilisation outside of a narrow zone that safely balances human well-being and economic growth against environmental preservation and long-term sustainability. 5 6 This emerging view suggests that the most effective solutions may lie upstream in rethinking this model and addressing its failures across sectors, from carbon emissions to quality of life.",

To facilitate that analysis, we here review the most significant drivers of viral emergence, and the current state of international cooperative agreements that might produce meaningful transitions towards sustainability and reduced disease risk. Given current geopolitical challenges (especially in environmental policy), we contend that the sum of conservationreliant approaches will still be insufficient to prevent future public health emergencies. To adapt pandemic preparedness to the Anthropocene, policymakers must focus on multilateral cooperation to develop stronger and more equitable public health governance, to strengthen health systems for universal health coverage, and to adapt viral surveillance to the pressures of a changing world. BMJ Global Health reduction. 7-10 However, the hypothesis that the Huanan 'wet market' was the site of a spillover event has since been eliminated, with the market more likely a location of human to human transmission. 11 Moreover, only a half-dozen of the hundreds of known zoonotic viruses have ever been linked to wildlife trade, 12 while its predominance in policy discussions has been intertwined with racism and international tensions, especially Sinophobia. [13] [14] [15] As a result, the predominance of wildlife trade in policy conversations-and the singulars urgency that predominantly Western conservation organisations have ascribed to these proposals-may have redirected attention away from bigger drivers of both spillover (like land degradation and climate change) and pandemics (like under-resourced public health and healthcare systems).",

As wild areas are destroyed and converted, encounters with displaced wildlife-often in poor health-create opportunities for zoonotic spillover. In rural areas, close proximity to livestock (and close proximity between livestock and wildlife) regularly exposes poor populations with potentially limited healthcare access to a number of zoonotic diseases. 17 In human-dominated areas, wild species that survive land conversion are predisposed to high stress and weaker immune systems, 18 reduced fear of humans, 19 and ultimately, to hosting zoonotic pathogens. 20 Together, these trends have driven a massive increase in infectious disease at the human-livestock-wildlife interface. 21 22 In the near future, land use change is only likely to accelerate as urban environments and agricultural production track growing populations, and the compound effect of these changes will be compounded by the worsening reality of anthropogenic climate change. As the planet warms and species' current habitats become newly uninhabitable, animals will migrate to higher latitudes and higher elevations, profoundly reorganising the global ecosystem. 23 24 As species meet for the first time, they are projected to share viruses with each other thousands of times. 25 Most cross-species transmission events will not affect human health, but a handful will include a mix of known threats, like Ebola virus (which could easily reach East African mammals in the next half-century); and unknown future threats, crossing into a new 'bridge host' that helps them reach humans (like civets for SARS-CoV, or camels for MERS-CoV).",

Flight could allow bats to easily cross continents, bringing many of the greatest zoonotic threats with them. Agricultural and human-settled areas will be hotspots of cross-species transmission, simply by virtue of their geography. 25 Perhaps the biggest complication is a non-linearity in ecosystem responses to climate change: species' habitats will move furthest in extreme climate change scenarios, but species will be more able to track shifting habitats when the pace of environmental change is slower. As a result, scenarios with only small doses of climate change and land use change might produce the greatest ecological disruption, and policy solutions that target land conservation and greenhouse gas emissions are unlikely to prevent climate-linked zoonotic emergence.",

While they identify and target drivers that underlie an accelerating rate of viral emergence, none can singlehandedly address the growing human footprint on the planet, or its underlying causes. A more radical vision of international cooperation could be imagined as a systemic alternative, one that starts from first principles with human rights, sustainability and futurism over the increasingly unstable balancing act between capitalism and human well-being. This may well become the norm in the first half of the 21st century, particularly given closely related trends like antiracist movements, pressure to decolonise global health. or massive populist organising for climate action focused on holding corporate power accountable. This may even sway multinational governance; already, major platforms like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have called for 'rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society'. 42 But even with significant, transformative social change, viruses with pandemic potential will still exist, and have plenty of opportunities to cross the barriers between species (just as they did for centuries before the industrial revolution). Even with every available solution to minimise viral recombination in wildlife and excess contact between wildlife and humans, livestock and synanthropic wildlife (those that live comfortably alongside humans) in urban environments can still easily act as a bridge for the next pandemic virus. A strategy for the upcoming century that tries to prevent every pandemic at the source-even one that coordinates across environmental sectors-risks not only failing, but providing a false sense of security that undermines the necessary steps for pandemic preparedness.",

Rather than lean into a worldview based in environmental determinism, where pandemics are the inevitable price of carbon emissions or deforestation, we suggest that global health already has tools to face a rising tide of emerging viruses. To borrow from the language of climate policy, the greatest global health governance need is a focus on 'adaptation' instead of 'mitigation': while ecological and economic solutions are necessarily devised to reduce upstream drivers of spillover risk, the global health community must prepare for the inevitability that spillover rates will still continue to growand must adapt to ensure that pandemic risk does not continue to grow commensurately. In any plausible future for climate change, global health and development, the world will have changed enough by 2050 that viruses cross between species thousands of times, many reaching humans for the first time. An Anthropoceneready health system must assume that inevitability, and prepare for both known and novel hazards.",

However, as the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, good governance is a critical but overlooked component of pandemic preparedness: information received must be used to inform and rapidly mobilise public health response. This requires clearly defined laws and policies for governance, alongside decision-making that is accountable, transparent, equitable, participatory and consistent with the rule of law. 43 Multilateral cooperation for pandemic preparedness is already undergoing significant review in light of the pandemic. This includes review of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), the primary BMJ Global Health instrument to prevent and respond to the international spread of global health threats. While the IHR have been drafted to capture a range of threats to global health, the six public health emergencies of international concern declared have all been for specific virus epidemics (influenza A H1N1 (2009), wildtype poliovirus (2014), Ebola virus (2014), Zika virus (2016), Ebola virus (2019), SARS-CoV-2 (2020)). In addition, the IHR do not provide sufficient guidance to states for 'response' activities. At present, there are no indications that any potential revisions of the IHR will include substantive consideration of environmental issues like land use and climate change. The cochair of the WHO's newly established Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, Helen Clark, has referred to a potential international convention for pandemics, 44 with the President of the European Council calling for a Pandemic Treaty under the auspices of the WHO. If appropriately situated, such as with the UN General Assembly, such a treaty could go beyond solely health expertise for pandemic preparedness and response, and include environmental, economic and social protection considerations. This could provide a synthesised and systematic preparedness and response framework for 21st century threats to health.",

To that, ensuring universal healthcare (UHC) is a critical element of both pandemic preparedness and adaptation to a changing world. 45 While there are a range of components to achieving UHC, strengthening primary healthcare can address 80%-90% of a person's health needs over their life, contributing to healthier populations and ensuring access to preventative care and treatment for acute and chronic conditions. 46 UHC is founded in the realisation of the right to health, and on the principles of ensuring that healthcare is available, accessible, acceptable and of sufficient quality, without discrimination. 47 For pandemic preparedness, UHC ensures that when people are sick, they can access healthcare immediately, without fear of economic hardship, while building the trust and preventive healthcare necessary for public health. 48 New evidence also suggests that in doing so, universal health coverage is also likely to improve conservation outcomes, and therefore reduce environmental degradation, in the communities where spillover risk is highest. 49 Addressing injustice within (and in some cases caused by) the healthcare system is critical to addressing the disproportionate burden of epidemic diseases on already vulnerable populations. Not only does realising UHC contribute to strengthening health systems for epidemic disease, it prevents illness and death from a range of non-securitized health challenges, including maternal and child health, non-communicable diseases and injuries. It is critical that any multilateral or global efforts for a postpandemic recovery focus on the precise preparedness necessary to alleviate human suffering and prevent deaths from viruses and other health hazards.",

Global health practitioners and advocates have long fought to centre the addressing of inequality, the realisation of human rights and the strengthening of health systems in political and financial decision-making. Despite best efforts, these objectives have historically been overshadowed by donor-driven securitisation narratives. There is a risk that in postpandemic efforts, these narratives will be redoubled-this time, supplemented by voices from other fields, who will likely be unfamiliar with the unintended consequences that securitisation can have, and how these consequences might jeopardise the mission of health for all and undermine current movements to decolonise global health.",

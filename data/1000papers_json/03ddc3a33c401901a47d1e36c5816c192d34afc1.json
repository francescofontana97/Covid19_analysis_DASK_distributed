The discussion, however, is applicable to many other practices the paper describes, and its relevance extends also beyond animal ethics. Some of the arguments discussed here for maintaining these traditions appeal to their positive aspects, such as their contribution to social or environmental harmony; other arguments focus on the impermissibility of one group criticizing another group's practices when its own are vulnerable to comparable criticism. Reflecting on the first kind of argument, the paper responds, building on the work of G. A. Cohen and T. M. Scanlon, that the value of tradition, if any, must be conditional. Reflecting on the second, however, the paper disagrees with Cohen and Scanlon on the impermissibility of casting the first stone.",

They do so because traditions involving human pain involve complications regarding consensual, endorsed, or pride-conferring pain, and the problems of brainwashing and adaptive preference formation. These considerations tend to be inapplicable to animals.",

For example, once we ban throwing goats from bell towers, as Spain now has, people can focus on making and throwing beautiful cardboard goats and have just as much fun or more. 5 When traditions are reformed, people adapt and forget the old ways, while, if no reform takes place, the suffering will continue indefinitely. The next section provides numerous examples.",

            "text": "A growing number of countries legislate against animal cruelty, generally understood as the needless, deliberate, or foreseeable infliction of intense or prolonged suffering, imposed to satisfy a desire to kill or dominate as a sport, ritual, or display, to impress, or to obtain other trivial benefits, such as alleged aphrodisiacs or entertainment. However, in tourist destinations, like Spain, cruel practices are increasing, with over 60,000 animals being sacrificed yearly for entertainment. Interactive maps explain what is done to each animal and when. 6 If the greatness of a nation can be judged by its treatment of animals, as Gandhi allegedly said, Spain is far from great. And while the number of professional corridas has decreased, amateur bullfighting at fiestas populares (local fairs) involving young cows and calves, and less experienced practitioners that typically cause slower, more painful deaths, has risen to 17,000 and continues to increase. 7 Bulls are also harmed outside the ring, for example, in Catalan correbous. Running scared through urban environments, as people tease them, hit them, and grab them by the tail or horns, bulls sometimes fall, and twist or break their legs, and people hit them to make them continue. Some bulls are dragged by ropes or knotted to a post (enmaromados) or have placed on their horns fireworks or inflammable balls that are set alight (embolados). Such horn-fires cause panic and burns. When the rope is placed around the bull's neck, it may choke from running scared. While on the bull's horns, the rope can cause trauma in the horn base and tears in the neck muscles. In Tarragona, Valencia, and Alicante, bulls are scared to the point of throwing themselves in the sea, as onlookers clap. Some fiestas amalgamate various practices, with participants stoning, beating, shouting, and spearing bulls.",

In Lekeitio, men tug at the necks of geese, pulling them in and out of the water, until their necks break. In Sagunto, ducks are thrown into the sea for men to play at catching them. In Huelva, horsemen spear wild boars. In Gerona and Valencia, greased pigs are released or thrown into the water so that men can try to catch them before they drown. In Galicia, horses are forced to walk on fire and have their manes uprooted by hand. In Castell\u00f3n, donkeys are hit and harassed to exhaustion. In C\u00e1ceres and Mallorca, newborn lambs are forced to walk the streets until they collapse, sometimes with dislocated bones. 8 There is still cockfighting in Andaluc\u00eda and Canaries, and ram fighting in the Basque Country. And across Spain, around 50,000 hounds are believed to be killed annually. 9 Repeated protests have recently achieved bans on throwing goats and turkeys from bell towers, on riding horses to chop hanging roosters with swords, on stoning kittens, hamsters, and squirrels trapped in clay pots hanging from a Judas crucifix, and on other activities celebrating a virgin or saint, with priests and bishops presiding over the celebrations. 10 Very similar practices are often defended as distinctive and unique, appealing to identity and tradition, because, as in other countries, tradition has become a lucrative business and a political tool.",

However, all whaling including the deceptively labelled Japanese practice of 'scientific whaling', as well as commercial whaling, is justified by appealing to tradition. 15 In fact, tradition is the justification used by the International Whaling Commission to allocate species quotas to certain countries. Tradition is the reason for whaling both in rich countries like Canada, where it survives only with subsidies, and in poorer places like Lamalera, in Indonesia, where whaling is so dangerous that people must be made to feel obliged by tradition to engage in it. 16 One might expect Japan and other parts of Asia, with their reincarnation faiths, to show more compassion for animals, but only half of Buddhists and around a third of Hindus are vegetarians. Jains are vegan, but not numerous. India has festivals like jallikattu where people are accidentally killed, 17 and many festivals where animals are killed. Hindus alone kill millions of animals yearly as sacrifices, to make a wish, or to bless a car or a flat. Some also drink blood directly from dying animals. 18 Buddhist temples practise sacrifices too. 19 In the largest animal sacrifice in the world, the Nepali Gadhimai, around a hundred thousand animals are incompetently maimed and killed, and around 10,000 goats are sacrificed in Dasain festivities yearly, with the government, army, and Gurka Palace sacrificing hundreds of water buffaloes as well. 20 Unfounded beliefs about the medicinal or aphrodisiac power of some animal parts are extremely deleterious. For example, in China and Korea, eating the raw penises of deer, tigers, turtles, and bulls-castrated while conscious-is said to increase sexual vigour. Besides causing suffering, the superstition-based trade in wild animals threatens biodiversity, and global health through zoonotic pandemics. 21 In Vietnam, health and prosperity are conjured by dipping money into the open bellies of living pigs. 22 Tourism is a major factor here too. In the Lijian River, I saw more cormorant fishing where there are more tourists, rather than where there are more fish, and although this practice is presented as uniquely Chinese, cormorants 13 https ://www.youtu be.com/watch ?v=0iyES wAkBR M. 14 See e.g. http://metro .co.uk/2018/01/24/russi a-prepa ring-slaug hter-stray -dogs-en-masse -world -cup- Gross (2015) and Kemmerer (2012) . 20 See http://turis mo-respo nsabl e.com/userfi les/file/dossi er-turis mo-respo nsabl e.pdf. 21 https ://elpai s.com/elpai s/2020/03/02/plane ta_futur o/15831 66211 _01788 1.html, https ://www.thegu ardia n.com/envir onmen t/2020/mar/18/tip-of-the-icebe rg-is-our-destr uctio n-of-natur e-respo nsibl e-forcovid -19-aoe. 22 https ://listv erse.com/2015/08/29/10-insan ely-bruta l-tradi tions -that-were-meant -to-do-good/.",

It is thus misleading to speak, as some do, of 'cultural survival', as if cultures could not be reformed, and would die, like an animal, from losing a part.

What Scanlon denies is that people who do not want to follow a tradition act unethically or contrary to reason. This supports the view that the reasons tradition gives, if any, are inconclusive. Scanlon denies that individuals have a duty to bear the costs of the traditions they reject, particularly when such traditions are harmful.

The latter weaker form of content-dependency resembles unconditionalism but does not balance the cruelty with the content-independent value of tradition but with other aspects of a tradition's content, such as the elegance with which the stabbing is performed. On the other hand, conditionalism is consistent with versions of a balancing view that incorporate the relevant conditionality. For here C refers to positions that balance any tradition with any cost but there are advocates of cost-benefit analysis that, for example, refuse to count as benefits the satisfaction of racist (or otherwise antisocial) preferences. These sophisticated advocates of cost-benefit analysis are also conditionalists since they attend to content and reject indiscriminate balancing.",

We resist such balancing not because we think that protecting our senses, health, or bodily integrity must always have lexical priority (an implausibly extreme view), but rather because when we face something that is fundamentally bad or wrong (such as universal blindness, illness, or involuntary intercourse), we should not proceed to list its pros and cons as we do when comparing two alternatives that initially stand on an equal footing. 37 We refuse to balance because the greater equality does not make a state of universal blindness or illness preferable, even in one way, and the greater utility enjoyed by an assailant does not make assaulting others less bad.",

For example, we should want to (1) reinforce permissible conventions (1), but not objectionable ones. Similarly, coordination (2) and date-fixing (4) are desirable only when what is facilitated is itself desirable.

The Makah are also divided between those who wish to return to whaling and associated power structures, and those who favour more inclusive alternatives, 53 and the Faroese, Norwegians, and Lamalerans are divided too. Protecting or subsidizing such activities while appealing to identity and self-rule makes them more divisive still, with many people rejecting how others construe their group identity. Cultural whaling is also a source of international conflict, causing tensions even between Greenpeace and cognate organizations. 54 Finally, additional division is caused because of increasing evidence that cruelty to animals is one of the best predictors of criminality, 55 and that it is an imitative behaviour. Most boys who terrorize dogs, eventually learn that this is not right. The people around them can encourage or discourage such behaviour. If, when boys engage in such acts, they receive praise from those they look up to-such as their elders, or religious leaders-discouragement is unlikely. It is thus unsurprising that illegal acts against animals are common in countries like Spain.

Either of them, however, can be buttressed by appealing to further considerations.

Discrimination may also increase if minority members are prevented from engaging in illegal or objectionable activities unrelated to any tradition. But the risk of increased discrimination remains a relevant consideration, and so should not be ignored. 74 In many cases, however, discrimination is unlikely to increase, and this risk does not always require us to remain silent and look away. 75 Sometimes, again, instead of doing less, it may be better to do more. And besides objecting to comparable majority traditions even more vigorously, and combatting discrimination and injustice, we may, in consultation with the relevant minority, find solutions that are better for everyone. For example, many minority members around the world have successfully transformed themselves into the guardians of the animals they formerly killed, becoming whale-watchers or park-rangers, with no loss of income, reputation or pride. No discrimination resulted from Greenpeace's successful campaign against Spanish whaling in 1985, or from the European Greens winning a vote against subsidizing bullfighting in 2015, and none will follow if Europe issues further restrictions on whaling or bullfighting.

            "text": "First, whales have extremely long lives to lose. Bowhead whales, for example, which the Inuit still hunt, can live well over two centuries. Longevity, which correlates with size, is even more strongly correlated with the number of neurons, which in turn correlates with intelligence. If bulls are killed rather than pardoned-as, unlike whales, they sometimes are-they may lose between six and ten more years. Whales, in contrast, stand to lose several decades or even centuries of a rich and complex life, exploring the world with their friends and relatives, weaving interesting biographies. 76 Second, highly intelligent, self-aware, and psychologically contiguous creatures-'persons', we might say-are more deeply connected to the future that we take away from them. This makes death worse for them than it is for animals that lack mental contiguity or future-oriented interests. 77 Third, bulls are gregarious animals that panic when forced into the ring alone. But whales are not only deeply social, but so attached to others that a traditional whaling technique consists of wounding an offspring to shoot those whales that come to assist. Whales have been seen carrying the dead bodies of their loved ones for weeks, with the whole group slowing down to allow the grieving relatives' corpsecarrying. Fourth, unlike bulls, whales have excellent memories, and may remember the massacre of their loved ones for their entire long lives. 78 Fifth, bulls endure 15 to 20 minutes of horrendous agony, but whales suffer too. Even medium-size minke 76 Herculano Houzel (2018). 77 McMahan (2002) , 232-240, Nussbaum and Nussbaum (2016) . The pilot whales that Danish and Norwegian whalers kill, for instance, have more neurons than humans in the areas of the neocortex associated with decision making, imagination, and judgment. See Mortensen et al. (2014) . There is a Declaration of the Rights and the Cetaceans, similar to the Declaration of the Rights of the Great Apes, because of the cognitive and emotional similarity between cetaceans and apes. However, whilst not even countries facing malnutrition license the eating of chimpanzees, some of the world's wealthiest countries are still whaling. 78 See eg. Bruck (2013). whales killed with the most modern methods suffer intensely for ten minutes. 79 It is far worse for whales that are larger, that swim away wounded, or that are killed by rudimentary methods to maintain tradition. Sixth, while bulls are killed publicly, once some whaling is allowed, it is easy to break the agreements regarding methods, quotas, species, and size. Seventh, while cultural whaling kills fewer whales than commercial whaling, when it is more of a pride-seeking than a protein-seeking activity, the meat thereby obtained is often forgotten in freezers and largely wasted. 80 It is unsafe to eat more than small amounts of whale and dolphin meat anyway, and so even local authorities regularly issue health warnings. Each bull, by contrast, is used exhaustively, and indirectly feeds those who also live off bullfight-related tourism. Eighth, since bulls are bred for bullfighting, in a sense their other option is not to be born. Whales, by contrast, are not bred and killed, but only killed. Finally, as explained earlier, whaling is an unmitigated environmental tragedy.",

We used to touch their amazing skin, enter their mouths, look into their massive eyes, and then see them hoisted and chopped into pieces, with rows of local men pulling out their endless intestines, and Japanese men climbing over them to chop their blubber into square chunks. We were told whale stories, and our house was decorated with vertebrae, baleens, and ribs. I still have a blue whale ear-bone next to me as I write. 82 And as soon as I spotted the Greenpeace boat on the horizon, I headed towards it in my little boat, relieved, ecstatic, and immensely grateful to these 'foreign busybodies' who had decided to make Spanish whaling their problem. For even as a child, growing up with whaling and bullfighting had only made me see the so-called 'cultural defence' as the sort of idea that may fool bien-pensant outsiders, but not those who know these traditions from the inside.",

This provides incentives for controlling pollution. These bateas belong to local families and benefit those who rent rooms and serve food. Thus, benefits and incentives are widely distributed. Now, while the adjacent bay, with its paper factories, has always smelled foul, ours is swarming with life. Fish and birds use the bateas to rest and feed; and sometimes swimming children, sometimes even dolphins approach the ropes. The neighbouring bay has a bullfighting ring, so animal rights protests are more common there. The most radical activists also find bateas impermissible, but it is hard to see sufficiently important differences between bivalves and plants to oppose what allows so many species to thrive. Now, between the morally impermissible and environmentally disastrous killing of long-lived, cognitively, and emotionally sophisticated whales, and the environmentally beneficial breeding of bivalves, there are many intermediate cases involving different animal species and different environmental effects. And it is not easy to see where to draw the line. Traditions such as whaling, bullfighting, and others described earlier, however, seem clear cases to me. And they cannot be defended by appealing to social cohesion, sustainability, or a critique of double standards. An environmental defence of any such tradition, moreover, would require scientific data regarding the environmental good allegedly preserved, not general claims about tradition that, as this paper has argued, have no unconditional normative weight. 83 Funding Casal is the PI of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness Grant, Der2016-80471-C2-2-R which supported research on this paper.",

This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of PUE on carotid arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) to provide the basis for the clinical application of PUE. Methods: Thirty male SHR and six male Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) aged 3 months were used in this study, SHR rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, PUE(40 or 80 mg/kg/d, ip) and telmisartan (TELMI) (30 mg/kg/d, ig) were administrated for 3 months. We use DMT myography pressure-diameter system to investigate biomechanical properties of carotid arteries, 10 \u03bcM pan-classical transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs) inhibitor SKF96365, 200 nM specific TRPC6 inhibitor SAR7334 and 100 \u03bcM Orai1 inhibitor ANCOA4 were used in the mechanical test.",

Mechanical characterization can be used to test hypertension treatments aimed at reversing mechanical remodeling changes that compromise human health. Large conducting arteries (aorta and carotid artery) in vertebrates are composed of a specialized extracellular matrix designed to provide pulse dampening and reduce the work performed by the heart. Intra-media thickness of carotid artery is a reliable indicator to reflect the changes of vascular function in clinical studies. When the matrix proteins of carotid arteries are altered in hypertension, the arterial wall can be remodeled, the mechanical properties changed, and leading to subsequent cardiac adaptation.",

Its chemical name is 8-C-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl-7,4-hydroxy-isoflavone and has a molecular weight of 416.382. PUE plays an important role in the treatment of angina pectoris, myocardial ischemiareperfusion injury, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases [4] [5] [6] . So far, anti-inflammatory [7] , antioxidative [8] and anti-arrhythmia [9] effects of PUE have been proven. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the antihypertensive effects of PUE is still not well understood. Recently studies have found that PUE could ameliorate pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in ovariectomized rats through activation of the PPAR\u03b1/PGC-1 pathway [10] . The latest research report that PUE exhibit high ACE2-targeting potential, it might be an ideal ponderable drug for COVID-19 through impairing the interaction between S-protein and ACE2 by SPR assays [11] , but whether PUE affects the vascular mechanical reconstruction of hypertensive rats has not been reported yet.",

The lumen and outer diameter of CCA were continuously recorded using a video camera, allowing real time quantification of the vasoconstriction and vasorelaxation respectively, incubated CCA with 10 \u03bcM SKF96365 (pan-TRPCs inhibitor), 200 nM SAR7334 (specific TRPC6 inhibitor), or 100 \u03bcM ANCOA4 (Orai1 inhibitor) for 30 min, then recorded the outer diameter and pressure changes.",

Both TRPC and Orai channels have been recently suggested to control phenotype of vascular cells and therefore to represent attractive novel targets for pharmacological prevention of vascular remodeling and aging [21, 22] . In order to further explore how PUE affects the biomechanical properties of CCA, we first used some Calcium ion channel inhibitors to gain further insight into the potential protective molecular mechanisms of PUE. We found 10 \u03bcM SKF could obviously decrease CCA pressure with endothelium compared to the control, and the effect of 10 \u03bcM SKF just equal to 25 \u03bcM in Fig. 6A . As shown in Fig. 6B , 200 nM SAR could also obviously decrease CCA pressure with endothelium. Figure 6C showed that CCA pressure with endothelium has little discernible change although ANCOA4 concentrations varied. So, we choose 10 \u03bcM SKF, 200 nM SAR and 100 \u03bcM ANCOA4 in the following experiment. As shown in Fig. 6D , pan-TRPCs inhibitor SKF and specific TRPC6 inhibitor SAR could obviously decrease pressure of WKY rats with intact endothelium, it illustrated some TRPCs channels played pivotal role in maintenance of mechanical properties. In Fig. 6E , the effect of SKF was still obvious in WKY rats without endothelium, the effect of SAR was not so obvious, so SAR might play roles through vascular endothelium. As shown in Fig. 6F , SKF and SAR could significantly decrease the increasing pressure level of SHR while the inner diameter increasing with intact endothelium, but without endothelium just SKF had obvious effect on decreasing the pressure in Fig. 6G , this further confirmed that some TRPC channels took part in CCA mechanics and remodeling of SHR rats. As shown in Fig. 6H , Ca 2+ -imaging experiment showed that PUE can reduce calcium influx induced by AngII in A7R5 cells. in Fig. 6I , PUE can obviously decrease cytoplasmic Ca 2+ concentration of A7R5 cells induced by AngII.",

            "text": "In the present study, we showed that PUE could significantly decrease SBP and DBP, obviously decrease thickness and inner diameter of CCA, the explanation is the apparently stiffer behaviors of the arteries in terms of a phenotypic modulation of VSMCs from more of a contractile to more of a synthetic phenotype. Arteries from all six groups retained smooth muscle and endothelial function and exhibited a similar partial tone and vasoactive capacity following mechanical test. Vascular agonists and Ca 2+ channel antagonists were applied outside of the pressurized artery(extraluminally), which is more representative of vasodilatory mediators released from surrounding tissue and/or parasympathetic or sympathetic innervation of vascular smooth muscle cells, allowing interaction with endothelium indirectly. This is a more physiological method of measuring the vascular endothelial independent reaction of vascular smooth muscle cells, not the circulating or endothelium-derived vasodilators. PUE affects multiple signaling molecules including the inhibition of oxidative stress, and the NF\u03baB and MAPK activation in vasculature and heart, which may contribute to its suppression of hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling and improvement of vascular function [24] [25] [26] . PUE produced vasodilation via an endothelium-dependent mechanism involving NO [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] and an endothelium-independent pathway mediated by the opening of K + channels in arteries [15, [32] [33] [34] . Vascular smooth muscle contraction is initiated by both calcium-dependent and -independent mechanisms, the structure and functional abnormal of calcium channels may lead to the occurrence and development of hypertension [35, 36] , but the effect of PUE on Ca 2+ have no consensus yet.",

Similarly to the endothelium, all members, except TRPC2, of all the TRPC subfamily have been detected in human vasculature by PCR, Western Blot, and/or immunofluorescence analysis [45, 46] .

While 12 weeks administration of PUE (40 mg/kg/d or 80 mg/kg/d) could reduce the passive NE-induced vasoconstriction, and SKF had no effect in these two PUE administration groups, the reasonable explanation was that PUE ameliorated Ca 2+ -induced constriction with the similar role as SKF, long term administration of PUE has decreased the expression of some TRPCs channel, or PUE has directly inhibited some TRPCs channels including TRPC6, but which specific TRPC channel PUE acts on remains to be further explored.",

PUE can also set off a chain of events and ultimately improves the mechanical properties and remodelings of CCA via blocking TRPCs. But in our study, the specific molecular target of PUE acts on and how PUE affect TRPCs should be assessed in follow-up work. Our findings raise some interesting additional questions about PUE that need to be answered.",

            "text": "According to anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroresponse in patients with COVID-19 from Croatia, we emphasised the issue of different serological tests and need for combining diagnostic methods for COVID-19 diagnosis. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG ELISA and IgM/IgG immunochromatographic assay (ICA) were used for testing 60 sera from 21 patients (6 with severe, 10 moderate, and 5 with mild disease). The main clinical, demographic, and haemato-biochemical data were analysed. The most common symptoms were cough (95.2%), fever (90.5%), and fatigue and shortness of breath (42.9%). Pulmonary opacities showed 76.2% of patients. Within the first 7 days of illness, seropositivity for ELISA IgA and IgG was 42.9% and 7.1%, and for ICA IgM and IgG 25% and 10.7%, respectively. From day 8 after onset, ELISA IgA and IgG seropositivity was 90.6% and 68.8%, and for ICA IgM and IgG 84.4% and 75%, respectively. In general, sensitivity for ELISA IgA and IgG was 68.3% and 40%, and for ICA IgM and IgG 56.7% and 45.0%, respectively. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody distributions by each method were statistically different (ICA IgM vs. IgG, p = 0.016; ELISA IgG vs. IgA, p < 0.001). Antibody response in COVID-19 varies and depends on the time the serum is taken, on the severity of disease, and on the type of test used. IgM and IgA antibodies as early-stage disease markers are comparable, although they cannot replace each other. Simultaneous IgM/IgG/IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing followed by the confirmation of positive findings with another test in a two-tier testing is recommended.",

In Croatia, this infection was soon recognised as a potential global threat, prompting the government and health officials to prepare a strategy for the emerging situation [3, 4] . Intensive epidemiological investigations were conducted in an attempt to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Active case finding and contact tracing coupled with the isolation of patients and the active health surveillance of their asymptomatic contacts were undertaken. Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases was increasing dramatically in neighbouring Italy. Epidemiological measures included the strict control of state borders and entry into the country, the closing of schools and shops, and the reorganisation of healthcare services in preparation for the care of a large number of severe cases [3] .",

Mild cases are not easily distinguishable from other respiratory tract infections as the first signs are similar. Early diagnosis and recognition of the disease are crucial for appropriate treatment and limiting viral spreading. During the pandemic, each patient with fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, sore throat, runny nose, or even diarrhoea should be managed as having COVID-19, and diagnosis can only be established with targeted microbiological diagnostics [2, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Clinical assessment of the symptoms and signs in accordance with the epidemiological data and medical history determines which specimens are drawn for diagnostic procedures. The main diagnostic clinical samples are nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs, and in severe cases sputum, endotracheal, or bronchoalveolar aspirate. In patients with no respiratory symptoms, stool and feco-anal swabs could be used [7, 9, [12] [13] [14] . Molecular diagnostics is a mainstay of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. COVID-19 should be confirmed by the positive reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2. The success of RNA detection depends on the specimen and the time of sampling from symptom onset, viral load, medical skills, and a PCR procedure with a negligible falsenegative risk [15, 16] .",

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG appeared later than IgA and showed different linear progressive trends, depending on the disease severity. A positive correlation between the severity of the disease and IgG antibody levels was also reported by Zhao [19] . Accordingly, it could be a useful marker of COVID-19 progression.

            "text": "Accurate COVID-19 diagnosis is a prerequisite for treatment and the implementation of epidemiological measures [8, 10, 25, 26] . In Croatia, molecular testing with RT-qPCR was organised shortly after the first cases were confirmed in Europe [3] [4] [5] 22] . Combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from all suspected COVID-19 patients were immediately tested, and positive RT-qPCR RNA confirmed the diagnosis. Although virus detection is considered fundamental, serological diagnostics have been introduced as a support White cell count: median (IQR) \u00d7 10 9 (3.4-9.7 \u00d7 10 9 ) 5 . 7 ( 4 . 6 -6.7) Lymphocyte count: median (IQR) \u00d7 10 9 for diagnosis. The risk of false-negative RT-PCR results is negligible, although possible faults must be considered even for sophisticated PCR due to various factors such as a low viral load in the upper respiratory tract, poor sampling techniques, sample quality, storage and transport conditions, and PCR reagent quality [7, 9, 11, 16, 26] . A combination of molecular and serological methods increases the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis, especially in a late phase of the disease [10] [11] [12] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Serological diagnostics have limitations. For a correct diagnosis, the application of different tests and methods is recommended, due to the lack of a gold standard. Furthermore, knowing the specificity and sensitivity, as well as the positive and negative predictive values, is important in the interpretation of the significance of the results. Different antigens, as antibody catchers, may have an impact on the results, creating incomparable data for monitoring antibody dynamics or for seroprevalence studies. Our anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG ELISA was based on the S1 antigen, and IgM/IgG ICA on the N and S protein fragments, but no statistically significant difference was found between these tests. However, the distributions of positive and negative findings for each method were significantly different, which suggests that, if only one method had been used, some of the subjects would not have been diagnosed correctly. All serological findings must be assessed in accordance with clinical and epidemiological data, taking into account the day of sampling and the gradual production of antibodies, as well as the different antibody classes detected with different methods [10, 11, [18] [19] [20] [21] . Host immunity has an impact on antibody production [20] [21] [22] . From days 2 to 4 after the onset of the disease, 5 patients developed IgM/IgA while 2 others had no detectable antibodies until day 10, and seroconverted on day 12. Seroconversion can be expected during the second week of symptoms [11, [20] [21] [22] 24] . The reasons for delayed immune response may be immunosuppression, low dose of infectious virus, or alternative virus entry routes. The high antibody titre determined in more severe cases could be correlated with virus abundance. Increased antibody levels are not always accompanied by virus removal, suggesting that antibodies alone are not sufficient to clear the virus [2, 19, 21] .",

The incubation time in COVID-19 is too short for antibody development, so antibody detection is mainly unsuccessful when clinical symptoms are appearing. In some patients, antibodies can be detected as early as the fifth day of illness and the detection sensitivity increases after the eighth day of illness. For serological diagnosis of acute COVID-19, at least two serum samples should be tested. The first serum should be taken during the first physical examination, and consecutive ones at intervals of approximately 7 to 14 days.",

For example, we rep o r t e d o n o n e p a t i e n t w i t h a u t o i m m u n e hypergammaglobulinemia and respiratory symptoms, who was RT-qPCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2 in two separate samples and showed low anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM reactivity but at the same time had detectable IgM against Lyme borreliosis, TBE, VZV, measles, and mumps. The similarity of coronaviruses may probably explain the false results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Furthermore, false anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA is also possible. In the evaluation of IgA assays, we encountered one acute EBV patient who had been diagnosed with IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although a limitation of this study is the small number of patients included, it is evidently important to detect the serological response in accordance with the duration and severity of the disease, the type of test, and the characteristics of the subjects. Testing consecutive samples and monitoring of the antibody kinetics are essential. Experience gained from low prevalence diseases points to the role of positive predictive values and the potential consequences of false-positive results.",

IgM and IgA antibodies as markers of early-stage disease are comparable, although they cannot replace each other. Simultaneous IgM/IgG/IgA antibody testing followed by the confirmation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive findings with another test in a two-tier testing approach is recommended. Even with the two-step testing approach, clinical interpretation is crucial for COVID-19 diagnosis.",

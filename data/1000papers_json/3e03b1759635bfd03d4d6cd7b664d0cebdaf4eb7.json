On this basis, analyzing single levels of tourism governance in an isolated manner without keeping their embeddedness into a broader framework in mind is of little value (Pechlaner and Volgger 2013) . Residents distanced themselves from specific physical spaces and certain social groups to maintain their positive image and the reputation of the place. Despite the spatial stigma in border towns, residents are still willing to support the development of tourism. Because now, tourism income became their primary source of income and freed themselves from another stigma related to social identity. We examine how a unique 'spatial stigma,' associated with a fatal disease and tourism mobility, is embodied in a wellness tourism destination. Moreover, emphasizes the need to look for alternatives to face the consequences of the current COVID-19 contingency, which from the understanding that international long-distance travel will not be possible in the coming months, shifts the focus towards regional tourism. Therefore, in addition to seeking national tourism, due to their strategic position, both cities seek bi-national collaboration. Both cities have experienced and recognition within the field of medical tourism, which allows them to generate attractive tourist products that motivate binational mobility. Ciudad Juarez has a cluster of health and medical tourism. This cluster allows a better position in the image of the city. Like a destination under this type of tourism, it could have another kind of opportunity. The historical attractions can reinforce with different programs such as Treasures of the Border, which seeks to generate interdependent agreements in the Buffer Zone (Paso del Norte Region) and position the city brand, reinforcing from an operational approach for workers and tourism service providers. San Luis Rio Colorado also identifies the lack of tourist identity. It seeks to position itself through medical tourism, backed by more than 50 years of experience, which is why it must face the low certification of tour operators and little cooperation to promote the destination. For this reason, the creation of a medical cluster sought. That will allow organized networks as well as the development of the mobile application that virtually promotes the destination.",

This prime was administered either at a low dose (LD) of 10 6 PFU or at a standard dose (SD) of 10 9 PFU, followed by a SD boost in all mice four weeks later. As expected, the LD prime induced lower immune responses relative to the SD prime.

            "text": "The data above suggested qualitative differences in T cell responses following a single shot with either a low or a standard dose of vaccine. It is known that after an initial antigen encounter, T cells differentiate into distinct subsets, including short-lived effector cells (Teff), effector memory cells (Tem), and central memory cells (Tcm). Teff and Tem subsets exhibit rapid cytotoxicity, but are short-lived. On the other hand, the Tcm subset is long-lived and exhibits enhanced recall capacity (2) . To evaluate if the priming dose affected the differentiation of these T cells subsets, we FACS-sorted SARS CoV-2specific CD8 T cells at week 4 post-vaccination (prime only), and performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Interestingly, SARS CoV-2 specific CD8 T cells elicited by a LD and a SD clustered differently, suggesting unique transcriptional signatures ( Fig. 3A ). CD8 T cells after a LD prime showed lower transcription of genes associated with effector function, such as Prdm1, Tbx21, Id2, Ifng, Gzmb, Gzma, Prf1, and genes associated with terminal differentiation, such as Klrg1 and Zeb2 (Fig. 3B) . Overall, the LD was associated with lower expression of genes associated with terminal effector differentiation ( Fig. 3C) (3). Importantly, CD8 T cells elicited by a LD showed higher transcription of genes associated with long-lived memory T cells, such as Tcf7, Id3, Bcl2, Ccr7, Sell (CD62L) and Il7r (CD127) (Fig. 3B ). Taken together, although the LD prime elicited a lower number of CD8 T cells, most of those CD8 T cells exhibited a Tcm signature with low terminal effector differentiation.",

In both LD and SD, TCR usage and diversity were similar and characterized by an oligoclonal expansion and a major and lower levels of the inhibitory PD-1 receptor (Fig. 5F ), relative to CD8 T cells induced after a SD prime.

We also reasoned that since mice that were primed with a SD harbor higher levels of virus-specific T cells and antibodies, this may result in more stringent competition for antigen during a subsequent booster immunization. To rule out these possibilities, we evaluated recall CD8 T cells in the absence of other pre-existing responses, by performing adoptive transfers of low numbers of purified SARS CoV-2specific CD8 T cells into na\u00efve hosts. Four weeks after priming mice with a LD or a SD, we FACS-purified splenic SARS CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells, and transferred these at equal low numbers (500 cells) into congenically distinct na\u00efve mice. One day after adoptive transfer, all recipient mice were vaccinated with the SD (10 9 PFU) of the SARS CoV-2 vaccine, and secondary CD8 T cell expansion was assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 6A ). We show that donor CD8 T cells from mice that were primed with a LD exhibited more robust secondary expansion compared to those primed with a SD (Fig.   6B -6E). These data show that a \"gentle\" antigenic prime elicits CD8 T cells that are intrinsically superior on a per-cell basis, and better able to mount a secondary response upon a booster immunization, irrespective of whether there are pre-existing vector or transgene-specific immune responses in the host. The adoptive transfer experiment above with normalized numbers of CD8 T cells was also consistent with our earlier scRNA-seq data showing that on a per-cell basis, a LD vaccine prime elicited less terminal differentiation with a superior Tcm differentiation.",

Therefore, we performed neutralization assays using SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus to measure the ability of vaccine-elicited antibodies to block viral entry. Consistent with the profound increase in GC B cells, the LD/SD regimen elicited a 43-fold improvement in neutralizing antibodies compared to SD/SD (Fig. 7D) .",

Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the anamnestic potential of antibody responses is also enhanced when the initial vaccine dose is reduced.

However, a possible trade-off of fractionating the priming dose is that it may initially result in lower immune responses, which may render the host transiently more susceptible to infection. Notwithstanding this potential concern, It is unclear what is the minimum level of immune responses required to protect against severe COVID-19, but a recent study demonstrated that even a low dose single-shot of an adenovirus-based SARS CoV-2 vaccine is sufficient to confer protection against severe disease in primates (7). Similarly, a single dose of a DNA-based SARS CoV-2 vaccine, which is ~1000-fold less immunogenic than a LD single-shot of our Ad5-based vaccine, was able to protect macaques from a SARS CoV- should be fractionated to allow more people to get vaccinated. A rationale for fractionating SARS CoV-2 vaccines is that it may result in wider herd immunity even if vaccine efficacy is only partial, and that this could have a more striking effect in blocking transmission at the population level. However, an argument against vaccine fractionation is that it has not been rigorously tested with SARS CoV-2 vaccines.",

A prior study by Ahmed and colleagues in the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) system showed that the duration of initial antigenic stimulation impacts T cell differentiation. This earlier study showed that CD8 T cells primed at the early stage of the infection preferentially differentiate into Tem, whereas CD8 T cells primed during the end of the infection preferentially differentiate into Tcm.

Thus, the effect of a LD prime on antibody responses is substantially more striking compared to its effect on T cell responses. Most of our mechanistic studies involve CD8 T cells, and our future studies will be aimed at understanding how a LD prime affects memory B cell differentiation. In vitro antibody neutralization is directly correlated with in vivo protection against SARS CoV-2 challenges (8) improved cross-reactive antibody responses compared to SD/SD.

These vaccines have already been administered to millions of people, and have shown potent immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy against severe SARS CoV-2 infection. TheCanSino and Sputnik V vaccines specifically utilize Ad5, which is the same vector platform used in our studies. Ad5 is among the most well-studied vaccine vectors, due in part to its extraordinary immunogenicity(5,6). Although SARS CoV-2 vaccines prevent severe disease and death, they do not always confer sterilizing immunity, warranting further optimization of current vaccine regimens. Another issue is that there is still an insufficient number of vaccine doses available to immunize the entire population, motivating health authorities to administer half doses of vaccines in order to double the number of vaccinated people, but there is little knowledge of how vaccine fractionation could affect vaccine-elicited immunity.",

These prior data suggest low levels of immune responses are sufficient to protect against severe COVID-19, which can explain the extraordinary success of multiple experimental SARS CoV-2 vaccines in the last year. There are historical examples of vaccine dose fractionation, also known as dosesparing, as a way to allow more people to get vaccinated. For instance, prior studies have shown that administering a fifth of the recommended dose of the yellow fever virus vaccine results in comparable immune responses relative to the recommended dose (9). Similar results have been reported for influenza, measles, polio and typhoid vaccines (10-12), which has led to discussions of whether SARS CoV-2 vaccine doses",

It is possible that our LD/SD regimen may confer a protective advantage relative to the SD/SD regimen at later times post-vaccination when vaccine-elicited responses wane. Therefore, in the long-term, a LD/SD regimen may potentially obviate the need for a third boost. The LD/SD regimen may also be useful to improve vaccine efficacy in individuals who develop suboptimal immune responses to vaccines, and who may benefit from having a higher level of immune responses.There are growing concerns about new SARS CoV-2 variants and their ability to evade immune responses elicited by vaccination or natural infection. There are also concerns about re-emerging coronaviruses, such as SARS CoV-1, as well as novel coronaviruses that may enter the human population in the future, and an important question is whether the current vaccines would protect against future coronavirus pandemics. We investigated this issue of \"immune coverage\" by analyzing cross-reactive antibody responses (SARS CoV-1-specific), and we show that the LD/SD regimen resulted in",

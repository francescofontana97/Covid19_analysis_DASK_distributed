Given a temporal digraph G with base digraph G, and subsets of vertices in time R 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , R k , i.e. sets of pairs (u, t) where u is a vertex of G and t a time stamp, here we investigate the many variations of finding (pairwise) disjoint spanning branchings with roots R 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , R k . Spanning can mean that one wants to pass by at least one appearance of each u \u2208 V (G) (called vertex spanning), or by all appearances of each u \u2208 V (G) (called temporal spanning). Similarly, edge-disjoint can have different interpretations, as it can refer to edges of G or to the appearances of these edges in G. We say that two branchings are edge-disjoint if they do not share any edge of G, and that they are temporaledge-disjoint (or t-edge-disjoint for short) if they do not share any appearance of an edge of G in G. We found that the only case in which this problem is polynomial (as its static counterpart) is when we want t-edge-disjoint temporalspanning branchings. We also found that if vertices are permanent (this is the more popular case where vertices are always active), the problem is polynomial for temporal-spanning branchings and NP-complete otherwise. Our results are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in the following main theorem. A digraph G is a in-star if there exists u \u2208 V (G) such that all the edges in G are incoming edges to u.

It remains to prove that each B j i is the edge set of a spanning branching of G j rooted at R j i . So, consider any i \u2208 [k].

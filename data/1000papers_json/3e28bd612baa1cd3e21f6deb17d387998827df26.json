According to the study, CoVs are a big family of virus common in diverse animal species, e.g. camels, cattle, cats, and bats which seldom transmit disease to humans except through epidemics. Examples of such epidemics in history have been the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which was almost entirely restricted to the Guangdong state of China for the first time in 2002 and 2003, as well as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS) first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and linked to countries around the Arabian Peninsula (e.g. United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Kuwait, Yemen, and Lebanon as well as Iran (Mardani, 2015) .

A study have shown that the geographical distribution size, shape and host body weight have significant effects on viral richness in bats (Maganga et al., 2014) . The study further suggested that viral abundance in African bats was greater in large-bodied species which had more uneven distribution and that increase of viruses may be associated with the historical variability of bat species distribution range, with hypothetically strong effects of distribution controls on virus spread (Maganga et al., 2014) . Moreover, there's a huge gap in knowledge about the relationships between COVID-19 and Africa's previous experiences of similar zoonotic infectious diseases outbreaks, such as Ebola (Richardson & Fallah, 2019) and Lassa fever (Sogoba, Feldmann, & Safronetz, 2012) . This may be important in improving understanding of management of public health concerns of particular geographical origin and their spread patterns in order to provide useful insights to meeting the sustainable development goal 3 to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. This paper therefore examines the onset, trends and geographical pattern of COVID-19 cases across Africa as a novel major outbreak caused by CoVs and since cutting-edge virological and genomic research has suggested that bats are reservoir hosts of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Sahin et al., 2020) , to investigate the links with the present spread to humans. Furthermore, noting studies have reported that most of the bat CoVs are the gene source of alpha-CoV and beta-CoVs, while most of the bird CoVs are the gene source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs, this paper also seek to ascertain the predominant strain of COVID-19 experienced in Africa.",

This is indeed very important in the medical geography assessment as limited employment of GIS has been documented of virus causing influenza-like respiratory disease outbreak such as COVID-19 (Sakai et al., 2004) . A recent study had considered the threat of ingress of COVID-19 into Africa from China especially subjecting this vulnerability to the weak capacity to respond.

Current population distribution among African countries however indicates serious unevenness as only few countries account for the high population stock of the continent, including Nigeria, clearly the most populous near the centre and surrounded at the fringes -Egypt, Algeria and Sudan to the north, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to east and South Africa to the south (see Fig. 2 ). Whereas, the share of Asia has been estimated to fall from 59% in 2020 to about 4% lower by the year 2050 and then to about 43% in 2100, global population growth is expected to concentrate in Africa going-forward regardless of the current decline rate in fertility. This population and the attendant rising population density is not only likely to increase ruralurban migration but, likely to exert more pressures on the already inadequate capacity of the continent especially infrastructure and human development requirements. This dwindling capacity of the continent of Africa to cater for its fast growing population, as indicated by the very low ratings of majority of its countries in the human development index, has become a new case for global worry.",

These variables serves as plausible precursors to COVID-19 cases across the continent. The derived model looks very positive, however, the individual contributions of each of the variables shows that there are too many predictors in the model with some being non-significant (p > 0.05) and thus suggesting that they do not contribute much to the entire model. It thus becomes very clear that only life expectancy at birth for female, population density and annual air transport show significant contribution to the model fit. The largest contributor having the largest positive standardized beta coefficient is the annual air transport (0.501, p < 0.05), followed by population density (0.418, p < 0.05), and then life expectancy at birth female (-1.746, p < 0.05).",

Within the period of 10 days, more than half of the continent, precisely thirty African countries took turns in reporting their first cases of COVID-19. This study has characterized these 10 days as Class IV -Astronomical onset, as thence was when the pandemic spread through the length and breadth of Africa.",

The fact that Africa prior to the outbreak lacked the capacity to test for the virus on a large scale as required to engage COVID-19. It is therefore not out of place to assume that the cases in Africa are under reported due to under discoveries and such that the countries with no cases may be due to the limits to their testing capacities.",

Generally, as presented in Fig. 5a -b, the spatial trend shows the more intense conditions being experienced both in the northern and the southern Africa region while steadily spreading hinterland towards the middle African countries from both ends.

Indeed, most of the countries bounded within the limits of the least distribution of cases coincides with the Least Developed Countries (LDC) in the continent and globally. This further underscores the links between development and the spread of COVID-19, as shown in the contribution of HDI (see Table 4c ) but more importantly, of population density and average annual air transport passengers carried, which were both found in this study as significant factors for the spread of the disease. The spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in Africa clearly follows a well discernable pattern as most of the countries with seeming more capacity for development have either been the first set to get plagued or have recorded the highest cases so far, Fig. 6 shows the result of the emerging hot spot analysis. Of particular note is the fact that about 60% of the continent is though categorized as not emerging due to no significant differences in the z-scores, however, the remaining 40% are categorized as emerging hot spots with about 30% being consecutive hot spots with significant z-scores at 99% confidence levels. This by implication indicates that the most densely populated regions on the continent are likely to experience increased number of COVID-19 cases.",

Older individuals are at higher risk compared with younger adults and children due to the presence of weaker immune functions. Healthcare workers are also at higher risk due to close proximity with the infected cases. Proper precautions and hand hygiene techniques can prevent the transmission of the disease. There is a dearth of evidence on how to manage the disease; therefore, protective measures might help to reduce the spread of infection. This article aimed to evaluate the preventive measure and use of protective equipment among healthcare workers and community settings. Subjects and methods Various recent literature searched in the following databases-Medline/PubMed, CINAHL, Scopusrecommendations from centre for disease control and prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) reports on preventive measures of COVID-19 were included. Results After reviewing the previous literature, we summarized proper precautions and hygiene techniques, use of PPE and applicability of surgical and N95 (can block 95% small particles but not resistant to oil) masks to prevent the transmission of disease. Conclusion This viewpoint can be considered as a unique example of information on infection control and protective measures. However, due to the lack of evidence, further research is required to compare the effectiveness of medical masks and N95 masks.",

In India, 49,391 cases have been reported, with 1694 deaths (WHO 2020). COVID-19 causes severe respiratory infection with a relatively high fatality rate in the most vulnerable populations. Until now, seven subgroups of coronavirus are known (Patrick et al. 2012 ). The 2019 outbreak of COVID-19 in the world caused by the novel coronavirus is the largest outbreak to date. COVID-19 can be transmitted to the healthy individuals by direct contact, indirect contact, and droplet method or aerosol mode. Several healthcare professionals also might also become infected with COVID-19. Additionally, people who recently travelled to China and other western countries and have fever and other symptoms have been evaluated for possible COVID-19 (Graham and Baric 2010; Li et al. 2020b ). The novel coronavirus belongs to the family coronaviridae, and is a large enveloped positive strand, RNA virus with high mutation rate. It is present in animals as well as humans and leads to mild to severe infections with respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic and neurological symptoms. The purpose of this viewpoint was to explore the knowledge of preventive measures and protective equipment to prevent the infection and transmission of disease.",

The virus enters the body, replicates in the upper respiratory tract, with further replication in the lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and might reach the brain. The incubation period is usually 14 days with onset of the disease to death from 6 to 41 days. The period depends on the age and health status of an individual. COVID-19 is highly transmissible by direct connect with infected individuals. Transmission via an indirect method and contaminated objects is possible (World Health Organization 2020). The principle mode of transmission in human outbreak is person-to-person transmission through direct contact and droplets. However, transmission through aerosols or from mothers to baby remain to be documented (Wang and Du 2020) .",

Person-to-person transmission followed and has affected a large number of people. Infection from humans can spread in several ways, including direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. Air borne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances during aerosols procedure performed such as intubation, open suctioning, turning a patient to the prone position, manual ventilation and tracheostomy (Wang and Du 2020) . Studies showed an increased number of leukocyte and cytokine in abnormal respiratory findings of infected patients (Li et al. 2020a) ; in liver biopsy, moderate microvascular steotosis and mild portal activity and in heart tissue, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates have been seen . In a case report of a patient infected with COVID-19, massive mucus secretions were seen in both the lungs (Lippi and BM 2020) . Laboratory findings showed leukopaenia with a leukocyte count of 2.91 X 10^9 cells/L of which 70.0% of cell were neutrophils (Li et al. 2020a ). In addition, increased C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and D-dimer might be observed (Qiu et al. 2020) . Human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) is broadly expressed in nasal mucosa, lung, heart, kidney, stomach, brain, etc. The first step of viral infection is the binding of receptor with host cells followed by fusion with cell membrane. Binding between the domains of virus spikes and cellular receptor of ACE-2 receptor suggested the entry of COVID-19 into the host via ACE-2 (Jin et al. 2020 ).",

To protect the airways from particulate matter (PM), such as dust, pollution, smoke, mist and droplets/aerosols, using a mask is crucial for healthcare workers while dealing with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19. People who are at very low risk can wear non-medical masks (cloth masks) or disposable masks and high-risk people should wear surgical masks or disposable masks. It has been recommended that to prevent spread of respiratory infections affected patients should wear masks 1. C (Clean)clean your hands frequently, with soap and water for at least 30 s or use alcohol-based hand rub 2. C (Cover)cover your mouth and nose with tissues/flexed elbow during coughing or sneezing 3. C (Call)call the healthcare professionals, if you feel unwell or having flu-like sign/symptoms 4.

Usually two types of masks are recommended to the individuals who are working in community or hospital settings. Triple layer, medical masks or surgical masks might provide barrier protection against large droplets and prevent hand to face contact, provide 94% (0.3 \u03bcm) of filtering efficiency and usually they are loose fittings (Neupane et al. 2019) . Whereas an N95 respirator mask is high filtration efficiency to airborne particles and designed to closely fit and provide a much tighter seal to the face, have high fluid resistance, good breathability and protect the individual from inhaling airborne particles during aerosol procedures. However, there is a lack of evidence that use of N95 masks can protect the individuals from COVID-19 virus infection (Bartoszko et al. 2020 ).",

Prolonged use of N95 masks might be problematic and feel uncomfortable to the wearer. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) that is exhaled can get trapped in the chamber of the mask and re-enter in the body and might lower oxygen delivery into the body. Re-entered CO 2 might cause hypercapnea and lead to symptoms of dizziness, fatigue, headache and disorientation (Sinkule et al. 2013) . The effectiveness of wearing a facemask to protect you from contracting the virus is thought to be limited. 3. Gloves -Gloves should be used while holding objects or touching surfaces potentially contaminated by a confirmed case of COVID-19. Nitrile gloves are preferred mostly because they resisit chemicals, including disinfectant such as chlorine. If not available latex gloves can be used. 4. Gowns -Use of gowns is to protect professionals from contact with blood or body fluids, organisms in the environment or from infected patients.",

From this viewpoint after reviewing recent databases, we found that limited evidence is available regarding the protective measures for COVID-19. Large clinical trials are needed to provide high quality evidence that can be used to form a systematic review and unique conclusions. Until that is accomplished, use of proper PPE when in contact with suspected and confirmed cases is recommendable to the community and healthcare workers. Take precautions, maintain hygiene and follow social distancing to prevent infection. The early detection and isolation of patients with COVID-19 might decrease the risk for the transmission in the community (Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4).",

In the RNAi-mediated antiviral pathway, virus-derived dsRNA (vi-dsRNA) produced from viral infection and replication can be sensed by the type III endoribonuclease Dicer and then cleaved into small viral interfering RNA (vsiRNAs) 21-24 nucleotides (nt) in length [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . These active vsiRNAs are integrated into the host Argonaute (Ago) protein to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) with the help of other host factors. Subsequently, RISC containing vsiRNAs directs the degradation of cognate viral RNAs by the endonucleolytic activity in a sequence-specific manner [6, 7] .",

VSR proteins are widespread among RNA viruses that infect plants and animals and have also been identified in some DNA viruses [10] [11] [12] . In mammals, a number of mammalian virus-encoded VSRs, including Nodamura virus (NoV) B2 [13] [14] [15] [16] , influenza A virus (IAV) NS1 [17] , enterovirus 3A [18, 19] , and dengue virus (DENV) NS2A [20] have been demonstrated to act as bona fide VSRs to antagonize antiviral RNAi in the context of authentic viral infections. Furthermore, hepatitis C virus (HCV) core and NS2 [21] [22] [23] , human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Tat [24] , Ebola virus VP35 [25, 26] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus N protein [27, 28] , the yellow fever virus (YFV) capsid [29] , and DENV NS4B [30] have been found to suppress the small hairpin RNA (shRNA)/siRNAmediated RNAi in vitro. The phenomena of numerous viruses encoding VSRs to suppress the RNAi pathway highlight the importance of antagonizing antiviral RNAi during viral life cycles.",

RuV is the sole member of the genus Rubivirus [31] , while humans are the only natural hosts of RuV. Postnatal infections of RuV are usually mild, resulting in low-grade fever, scarlatiniform rash, or cervical lymphadenopathy [32] . However, maternal infection by RuV during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage and/or other congenital defects in newborns, collectively defined as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) [33, 34] . CRS is typified by a characteristic pattern of birth defects that include cataracts, deafness, blindness, cardiac defects, and intellectual disability [35] . Up to now, the epidemics of RuV infection occasionally occur in developing countries and CRS remains a major public health concern all over the world [36] . To date, there are no approved antiviral therapies specific for RuV.",

The RuV capsid protein is the sole virus-encoded protein component of the nucleocapsid that participates in many processes critical for the viral life cycle, including membrane association, RNA-binding [37, 38] , modulating viral RNA replication [39, 40] , mitochondrial rearrangements [41] , and inhibiting host protein translation by a nonenzymatic mechanism [42] . Our previous study demonstrated that the capsid protein encoded by the Semliki Forest virus (SFV), an important virus belonging to the Alphavirus genus in the family of Togaviridae, is a bona fide VSR that antagonizes antiviral RNAi in the context of SFV infection in cells [43] . Because the genomic structure and expression pattern of RuV and alphaviruses are similar, it would be intriguing to exploit whether the strategy of using capsid protein to suppress RNAi by SFV is also shared by RuV.",

The R169A, D171A, or R169A/D171A mutation (capsid R169A , capsid D171A , or capsid R169A/D171A ) significantly suppressed the activity of the RuV capsid to inhibit RNAi ( Figure 4C ) in HEK293T cells.

As expected, the viral RNA accumulation of SFV K124A/K128A was lower than that of SFV WT in HEK293T cells, while the genetic ablation of the RNAi pathway by Dicer knockout (NoDice) rescued the replication of SFV K124A/K128A ( Figure 5A ). The viral RNA replication of SFV K124A/K128A in HEK293T cells was increased by ectopic expression of RuV capsid WT or SFV capsid WT , but not the VSR-deficient mutants of the RuV capsid (capsid R1169A/D171A and capsid \u2206B ) or SFV capsid (capsid K124A/K128A ) ( Figure 5A ).

In this study, we found that the RuV-encoded structural protein capsid displayed VSR activity that suppresses Dicer-mediated siRNA production by sequestrating dsRNA and siRNA-induced RNAi in mammalian cells. Moreover, the VSR activity of the RuV capsid can rescue the defective replication of VSR-deficient viruses.

A virus-encoded capsid usually contains RNA-binding and dimerization activities, as association with viral genomic RNA, dimerization, and further oligomerization are necessary for viral nucleocapsid formation and the assembly of high-order structure of virions. In the case of RuV, our mutational analyses showed that mutation of R169A and D171A or deletion of the \u03b2-strand B region abolished the dimerization and dsRNA-binding of the RuV capsid, and, in turn, substantially reduced the VSR activity. Interestingly, the mutant PVWP, which was previously reported to disrupt the interaction between neighboring RuV capsid dimers to form high-order structure [48] , have no influence on the VSR activity of the RuV capsid. These data indicate that dimerization, but not oligomerization, is required for the VSR activity of the RuV capsid, which is in line with previous findings that dimerization is a common feature for many VSRs, including NoV B2, EV-A71 3A, and SARS-CoV-2 N.",

These are viral diseases such as AIDS, Ebola, acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and in the present -Covid-19. Covid-19 is a disease of the coronavirus family. Although it is still too early for detailed data related to this virus that progresses as a pandemic, it is a viral disease that spreads quickly and can cause serious complications including death. Covid-19 is suspected when the patient has been in a high-risk area 14 days before the onset of the disease, has been in contact with a SARS-CoV-2 virus positive patient, and shows symptoms of sudden onset including fever and lower respiratory infection. Among the clinical findings of Covid-19 are signs of lower respiratory tract infection, such as fever, cough, as well as shortness of breath. Computed tomography (CT) is characterized by multiple irregular shadows especially around the lung and interstitial changes in the lung periphery in the early period. This condition then turns into ground glass opacity and infiltration in both lungs. It is stated that the number of white blood cells in the early stage of the disease is normal or decreased, while the number of lymphocytes will gradually decrease. 4 Information about the course of the disease is not yet clear. Therefore, the following points about Covid-19 should be taken into account in post mortem processes.",

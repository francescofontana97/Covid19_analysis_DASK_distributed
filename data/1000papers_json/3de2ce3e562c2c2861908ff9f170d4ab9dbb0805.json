Therefore, when the nature of their educational experience radically changes-such as sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic-the burden on the mental health of this vulnerable population is amplified. The objectives of this study are to 1) identify the array of psychological impacts COVID-19 has on students, 2) develop profiles to characterize students' anticipated levels of psychological impact during the pandemic, and 3) evaluate potential sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, and awareness of people infected with COVID-19 risk factors that could make students more likely to experience these impacts.",

Bivariate associations showed students who were women, were non-Hispanic Asian, in fair/poor health, of below-average relative family income, or who knew someone infected with COVID-19 experienced higher levels of psychological impact. Students who were non-Hispanic White, above-average social class, spent at least two hours outside, or less than eight hours on electronic screens were likely to experience lower levels of psychological impact. Multivariate modeling (mixed-effects logistic regression) showed that being a woman, having fair/ poor general health status, being 18 to 24 years old, spending 8 or more hours on screens daily, and knowing someone infected predicted higher levels of psychological impact when risk factors were considered simultaneously.",

Mental health hotlines in the United States experienced 1,000% increases during the month of April, when most people were under lockdown because of the pandemic [7] . Some medical facilities have seen more deaths from suicide, presumably because of exceedingly poor mental health, than from COVID-19 infections [8] . Substance disorders in many people who were previously abstinent are expected to relapse during COVID-19, which will cause long-term economic and health impacts [9] .",

These schools collectively represent a somewhat unique context within higher education. The United States educates large numbers of students from around the world [18, 19] . Diverse student bodies may show different risk factors from more culturally-homogenous student bodies because of the diversity of value orientations [20] and sources of media consumption [16, [21] [22] [23] . Further, colleges in the United States cost more than higher education institutions nearly anywhere else in the world [24] ; therefore, financial concerns may be particularly apparent in the United States. The United States also experienced the lowest global recovery rate from infection-in other words, the highest mortality rate post-infection-in the weeks leading up to the timing of the current study (April and May, 2020) [25] .

Sociodemographic factors were self-reported and allowed identification of potential differences in impact levels by gender, age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and academic status (undergraduate vs. graduate-seeking). SES was measured with perceived social class, which has been shown to accurately represent SES in student populations, using a battery of seven questions on class, parental education, and relative family income [34, 35] . To measure academic status, we asked respondents whether they were in pursuit of an undergraduate or graduate degree.",

Z-scores of the input variables were used to interpret the profiles. The criteria to assign low and high values is not established and so we adopted previous studies' thresholds [53] .

Determining risk factors for being in the high impact profile was deemed more important and actionable by university administrators than determining risk factors for each of the lower impact profiles, as would have been accomplished with a multinomial model. Thus, this modeling approach served a practical function; results could inform university administrators with tight budgets on how to prioritize funding for mental health interventions amongst students at greatest risk of high levels of psychological impact. Unadjusted results remained relevant, however, since they served the function of comparing risk factors between each level of impact profile in a simpler format than the output of a multinomial regression model.",

The most common changes in how students felt compared to before the pandemic were increased lack of motivation, anxiety, stress, and isolation. For example, one of the students reflected, \"I'm normally extremely motivated, and I've never struggled with depression, but have recently felt very sluggish and melancholy.\" Another student described their feelings related to isolation as \"I feel trapped. I don't have anywhere I need to go since I can't socialize, and I have schoolwork. But yet I still feel trapped due to actual restrictions and suggestions.\" The most frequent changes in student behavior compared to before the pandemic included more social distancing, more education changes, and less going out. Other concerning changes ranged from entrapment, boredom, fatigue, hopelessness, guilt, and inconvenience to hygiene, sleep, housing, employment, personal finances, and caretaking. For example, some students expressed their frustration with the financial situation, including one statement indicating: \"I am BROKE. I lost my job because of this pandemic and now I can't pay for groceries.\" Other students were concerned about online learning. For example, one student commented: \"I am constantly on edge about coursework: Did the computer register I submitted my exam? Did I see everything my teacher posted in Moodle? What happens if my internet goes out and I miss an assignment?\" Smaller numbers of students reported positive changes from the COVID-19 pandemic as well. These included optimism, productivity, adaptation, and empathy, as highlighted in the following quotes: \"I've affirmed that people are capable of adapting in any circumstances\" and \"[I felt a] higher degree of empathy toward my community\".",

We labelled the first factor as \"Emotional Distress\" since it was composed largely of negative affect items (afraid, irritable, sad, preoccupied and stressed). The second factor was composed of three items dealing with how time was spent presumably in worry during the pandemic (worry, too much time and a lot of time), and so we labelled it \"Worry Time.\" This is a term from clinical psychology that describes time spent reflecting on all the possible impacts of a health concern, including those worries that an individual cannot do anything about [66] . The internal reliability of the factors was high, Cronbach's \u03b1 = .87 for Worry Time and .83 for Emotional Distress. A three-profile solution fit the data best for the LPA. Information criteria decreased with additional profiles up to a five-profile solution, indicating a better model fit (S2 Table, The elbow plot suggested minor improvements in model fit after a three-profile solution. Adding a fourth or fifth profile provided less interpretable results. Based on the combined information from the statistical criteria and interpretability, we retained a three-profile solution as our final model.",

Men demonstrated the opposite pattern. We did not observe differences by academic status (\u03c7 2 (2) = .3, p = .9), although we did observe differences by age (\u03c7 2 (4) = 15, p = .005). Students who were 18 to 24 years old were more likely to be in the moderate profile (RES = 3.81, p = .0013), and students who were 25 to 32 years old were less likely to be in the moderate profile (RES = -3.03, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245327.g001 p = .022) than other profiles. No other significant differences between age groups by profile were found, p > .05. We also observed racial/ethnic and SES differences in psychological impact levels. Specifically, we found differences by race/ethnicity (\u03c7 2 (6) = 18, p = .007) with non-Hispanic Whites being more likely to be in the low profile (RES = 2.98, p = .035) and Non-Hispanic Asians being less likely to be in the low impact profile (RES = -3.42, p = .0076). No differences in impact profiles were observed for non-Hispanic Black students or Hispanic students, although sample sizes were small (n = 95 and 98, respectively). Parental educational achievement measures further showed no differences in profiles, p = .5 for maternal and .9 for paternal. No differences were observed for parental social class either, p = .1 for maternal and .2 for paternal.

Among the most commonly reported changes were lack of motivation, anxiety, stress, and isolation, as well as social distancing, education changes, and going out less. Similar findings were reported by another study exploring the impact of COVID-19 on students at a single college in the Table 6 States universities (N = 2,140 United States, revealing increases in sedentary lifestyle, anxiety, and depressive symptoms [16] . A global study examining experiences of students in 62 countries, including one university in the United States, found that students' expressed concerns about their academic and professional careers, as well as feelings of boredom, anxiety and frustration [10] . Increased anger, sadness, anxiety and fear were also reported by students in China [67] . Students in Switzerland reported a decrease in social interaction and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and loneliness [68] . More generally, adults have reported decreases in physical activity and food consumption increases during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine compared to beforehand, as well as increases in binge drinking on average [69] , which was identified in a small portion of our student respondents as well. Slight differences between our studies' results and results from studies conducted elsewhere may be due to the differences in student experience by geographical location. The United States is providing relatively little financial relief to college students during the pandemic compared to other Global North countries [70] .",

Contrary to our unadjusted findings, Asian or Asian-American students in the Nevada study reported lower levels of anxiety and depression than other races.

Women are generally prone to depression and anxiety disorders [14] , and although initial evidence indicated men were more susceptible to infection [77] , our study supports the assertion that women appear to be more strongly impacted by the long-term psychological impacts of the pandemic. This observation may be attributable to higher levels of pre-existing psychopathology in women as well as gender differences in fear processing, which could translate to exacerbations of symptoms [78] . Also, male students tend to have higher confidence in the computer skills necessary for the transition to online course delivery [10] . Meanwhile, women are more concerned about impacts on their professional career and ability to study than men, on average [10] . One study attributed these gender differences to greater emotional expression, less tolerance for uncertainty, and less-effective coping strategies amongst students who are women [75] . Women have also reported being more susceptible to \"emotional hunger\" and subsequent increased food intake than men during COVID-19 quarantine; these behaviors can lead to weight gain and poor mental health [73] .",

Excessive use of digital media also detracts from time that could be spent on other health-promoting activities such as outdoor recreation [86] . Our study supports these relationships, suggesting negative impacts of screen time and positive impacts of \"green time\" on students' psychological health. The unadjusted analyses suggested that outdoor time predicted psychological impacts of COVID-19, although this variable was not significant in multivariate models. Other studies justify its consideration as a risk factor by university administrators. Both outdoor recreation [87] and nature exposure [88, 89] can improve psychosocial and eudaimonic well-being [90, 91] .

Select programs that have promoted mental health-such as those at the University of Connecticut, University of Kentucky, and Northeastern-include virtual group exercise and meditation/mindfulness sessions, accountability buddies and exercise challenges and telemedicine/counseling visits [99] . These group meetings may be helpful not only in lowering anxiety but also in decreasing the sense of isolation reported by the students in this study. Digital interventions for students with clinical levels of anxiety or depression as well as potential for self-harm or suicide can involve automated and blended therapeutic interventions (such as apps and online programs), calls/text messages to reach those with less digital resources, suicide risk assessments, chatlines and forums, and other technologies to monitor risk either passively or actively [80] . Recently, Chen et al. [100] recommended a six-step intervention for the reduction in psychological impact risk amongst Chinese college students. These steps included the delivery of positive pandemic-related information, reduction in negative behavior, learning about stress management techniques, improvements in family relationships, increases in positive behavior, and adjustments in academic expectations.",

In support of this proposition are recent findings that cognitive and behavioral avoidance (i.e., avoiding situations where exposure is possible and difficult thoughts about the pandemic) was the most consistent predictor of increased anxiety and depressive symptoms during the pandemic [17] . Cognitive reappraisal of stressful situations can alter their negative impacts [102, 103] . Training students to shift their educational experience mind-set to one that focuses on the \"silver linings\" and emerging opportunities may lead to \"stress-related growth\" and \"toughening\" [104, 105] . Adaptive mindsets can also help reorganize priorities to develop deeper relationships and greater appreciation of life [106] , as well as help students to adjust to new ways of learning. Since a portion of the students in this study reported feeling less motivated, productive, and able to focus, switching to an adaptive mindset may help students persevere in their education and later in life. Finally, mindset reappraisals can increase well-being, decrease negative health symptoms, and boost physiological functioning under acute stress when a family member becomes infected or the pandemic creates rapid shifts in policies and procedures that affect students [107, 108] .",

Many students seek out social interaction during their university experience [109] [110] [111] . However, as the findings of this study revealed, students' opportunities for socializing significantly decreased in the early stages of COVID-19. Missing \"going out\" and important milestone events (e.g., graduation, last sporting event) was a frequent response from our student participants. Other studies found that in order to maintain students' mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, they communicated online with close family members or roommates at least daily [10] . With college students, physical distancing does not and should not require \"social distancing\" [101] . Both synchronous (i.e., Zoom) and asynchronous (i.e., Facebook group) online interactions can foster bonding and bridging social connection [112] [113] [114] [115] , which can extend beyond social media posts and email listservs. Normal venues where people congregate such as places of worship, gyms, cafeterias, yoga studios and classes can be replicated online or even held outdoors in temperate weather on a schedule similar to what was in place prior to the pandemic [116] . Other recently-successful interventions include the facilitated online sharing of recipes, books, and podcasts as well as virtual movie, game, trivia, or happy hour nights [99] . Providing support to student organizations to coordinate these virtual social activities could accelerate the availability of these resources.",

As previous research has found, academic success may be supported with virtual town halls, regular email check-ins, virtual office hours, and peer mentoring [104] . Globally, students' satisfaction with university response to COVID-19 is predicted by students' satisfaction with pre-recorded videos during online course delivery, sufficient information on exams, satisfaction with teaching staff, satisfaction with websites and social media information with regular updates from the university, hopefulness, (lack of) boredom, (lack of) study issues, being on scholarship, being able to pay for school, and study discipline (social sciences tend to be less impacted than hard sciences or engineering) [10] . Universities may be encouraged by findings from another study on the switch to online courses; this study found many students were not challenged by the transition because of their aptitude toward digital learning and new technologies [118] . However, another study found new software platforms can be a challenge for some students [10] .",

Another limitation related to the sample is the high percentage of non-Hispanic Whites.

We did not measure substance abuse, which is expected to be a ramification of the virus [116] and which anxious individuals are prone to under-report [120] . Such counterproductive coping behaviors could be particularly problematic for college students [121] . Further, because our predictors explained a small amount of variance of the profiles, other unmeasured (or better measured) factors might predict students' psychological risk. For example, our single-item measures of leisure time activities could be improved with a more comprehensive assessment of time budgets such as those employed in episodic time use surveys [122] .",

In the present study, we isolated epidemic strains of CVA16 and optimized the production of the virus in Vero cells. The system comprised growing the infected cells on polymer fiber paper carriers in a serum-free medium containing 0.5% (w/v) lactalbumin hydrolysate a mini bioreactor. Disposable Bioflo310 and AmProtein Current perfusion bioreactors were used to monitor virus infection and Vero cell culture. The total number of cells increased from 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 to 3.0 \u00d7 10 10 . In our optimized culture process, the virus titer reached 7.8 \u00d7 10 7 TCID 50 /mL at three days after infection. The inactivated CVA16 prepared from our optimized culture procedure elicited a slightly higher neutralizing antibody titer compared with that derived from routine culture procedures. These results will promote the large-scale production of inactivated CVA16 vaccines using nonwoven polymer fiber paper cell cultures.",

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackie virus A16 (CVA16) are the two main pathogens of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which had spread recently in the Asia-Pacific region [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, no CVA16 vaccine for HFMD is commercially available [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Increasing evidence has shown that both EV71 virus and CVA16 virus infections could cause serious neurological complications and even death. Therefore, when developing vaccines for HFMD, EV71 and CVA16 should be targeted [7, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

The effects of pH and DO should be further investigated in a large-scale bioreactor [36, 37] . To meet the requirement of GMP and the ability to practically manufacture a vaccine, we established standards to reduce the cost of production and increase the quality of the vaccine. The viral incubation time was limited to less than five days, and after CVA16 inoculation, we used different medium supplementation strategies. Moreover, only the supernatants (extracellular virus) were harvested, aiming to decrease the contamination of residual host cell proteins and DNA in the final product as much as possible. The intracellular virus from cell lysates were stored as virus seeds. To reduce the costs associated with the culture medium, we explored a suitable medium supplementation strategy. The results identified that G5 was the most suitable medium supplementation strategy. Using this strategy, the viral yield was negligible before 48 hpi; therefore, the supernatant was only harvested after this time point. In addition, the supernatant contained substantially less intracellular content, which might be convenient for downstream purification. Prior to viral infection, the cells were supplemented with FBS and had sufficient nutrition reserves. Following infection, the cells received FBS for the first 24 h and then received 5% LH for the remainder of the infection period. The final virus titer suggested that this strategy could supply sufficient nutrients for the cells over the next three days. Thus, as a medium supplement, LH is more economic and suitable than FBS or VP-SFM in this system. Inactivated virus immunogenicity is a crucial factor that affects vaccine progression to clinic trials. The purity of the harvested CVA16 virus and the downstream purification methods can affect the immunogenicity of the inactivated CVA16 virus. The observed increase in neutralizing activity might be attributable to the use of a relatively \"serum-free\" strategy and the low shear force during the culture of virus.",

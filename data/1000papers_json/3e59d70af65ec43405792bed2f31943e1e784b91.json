Using a case study of Mexico, it reviews the effects on the environment and the human well-being of the dominant economic model based on wasteful fossil energy, social inequality, consumerism, fashion, and growth concentrated in small elites. This model has brought both the planet and society as a whole to its limits of survival, but it has also affected regions, cultures and social classes differently. Poor countries and vulnerable groups have become the main victims suffering from socio-economic and climate-induced changes. In Mexico, the epidemiology has been changing, and traditional illnesses (diarrhoea, pulmonary conditions, under-nourishment) coexist with modern ones linked to the transformation of the diet (diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancer) and the pollution of water, air and soil (intoxication, respiratory, kidney and skin problems).",

It introduces the evolution of the health and water security concept and both will be discussed in the context of the widening, deepening, and sectorialisation of security concepts. Part three deals with climate change and its impacts on health and water security in Mexico, which are explored with the PEISOR model. Part 4 discusses climate impacts on highly marginal groups and their social vulnerability. The next subchapter explores the restoring of ecosystem services and its effects on health and water security. The concluding part suggests a dual scientific and policy-orientated complex analysis of water and health security with greater equity that combines bottom-up initiatives of water conservation and health practices (often traditional ones) with top-down strategies of water management and health policies (WASH), where the research questions are discussed in a conceptual security framework.",

Later, with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the AH1N1 or in 2020 Coronavirus influenza strain, the outbreaks of pandemics were integrated into its health security agenda and goals. The declaration by WHO of a global pandemic emergency has had severe effects on the economy and on jobs in some affected countries. 3 This state-centred understanding of health security included recommendations to combat the pandemic with a global vaccination and strict hygienic practices to prevent global spread of the pandemic, along with developing specific drugs to combat the concrete illness. Related to a military and political security approach, policy-makers in industrialised countries emphasised the protection of their population against external threats, unknown epidemics (WHO 2002b, c, d) and terrorism. This narrow understanding of health security was globally promoted by WHO (2003) at the request of and in close consultation with many industrialised countries. Poor countries were confronted with new political pressures to buy drugs and vaccines to fight against these pandemics (most of them are protected by patents under WTO rules and therefore expensive), while other more urgent health issues could not be funded due to limited financial resources, such as safe water and basic sewage water sanitation.",

This second approach focuses on the interrelationship between human health and environmental services as important health providers (MA 2005) and expresses the crucial relationship between water and health security (Cort\u00e9s/ Calder\u00f3n 2011; Avelar et al. 2011) . Critics observe that in the dominant approach to health security and health policy, the state-centred position does not attribute sufficient attention and resources to the other six billion primarily poor people, who still lack access to affordable health care. Their approach concentrates on the limited financial health resources in poor countries, where the sole state-centred effort lacks an integral health care system. Further, the environment and water and vector-borne diseases in particular play a crucial role in maintaining and recovering human health (Hansen/Corzo 2011). ",

The IMF and World Bank (2010) prepared for the UN Summit and explained that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), signed by 191 countries belonging to the UN, cannot be achieved in terms of halving the number of poor and hungry people in developing countries. In Latin America, only Venezuela and Cuba have fully achieved their MDGs on paper (UN 2015) . Elsewhere, the interrelations of the food, energy and financial crises have increased the number of the extreme poor in 2009 by 40 million and in 2010 by 64 million inhabitants. Consequently, in 2010 it was estimated that by 2015, 1.2 million children under five years would die due to hunger and, additionally, 100 million people would be without driven by corporate capitalism and international organisations (WTO, IMF, WB) that have pressured national governments to privatise public services and to initiate deregulation processes. The economic outcomes have been a drastic reduction in the income of the nation state and a smaller public budget for social support and public work on health and water issues. On the other hand, they are increasing the costs of basic services for poor customers (Barkin 2011) , and in precarious economies the higher costs compete directly with the food intake and thus have negative impacts on the immune system and personal and collective health.",

While economic and financial flows are globally occurring and beyond the control of most countries, the world lacks a global governance system with globally accepted rules to maintain financial, social and environmental stability.",

After the Cold War, as a logical consequence, a reduction in the arms trade was expected, with the potential to reallocate the resources from weapons to social improvements. However, the contrary occurred, and in 2011 more than US$ 1.3 trillion were spent on arms and the military (SIPRI 2010). The political instability of post-colonial countries has pushed these unstable regimes to increase their defence budget by further shrinking the limited social investments to mitigate extreme poverty and hazard-affected regions. Additionally, the illegal international arms trade and the proliferation of small arms worldwide have created even more complex social conditions. All these factors reduce the amount of public expenditure, but also the personal spending for improving public and personal water and health security. In addition, due to the effects of climate change, its impacts on the people and the environment are complex, and concrete outcomes may differ in each geographical region.

The formal administration is under control by the National Commission of Water (Conagua) , which has divided the country into 13 hydro-administrative regions which often embrace several states and are therefore responsible for permanent conflicts between neighbouring states and their local water management and legal autonomy. Sixty-eight per cent of the rainfall occurs between June and September. For the rest of the year, the aquifers are crucial for the domestic water supply and for satisfying industrial and agricultural needs. The irrational water management, primarily in the agricultural sector, which uses 77% of all hydric resources, polluted river water and often not very transparent local irrigation authorities threaten Mexico's water security and its future water resources. Of the existing 653 aquifers, 108 are over-exploited and the CVMC is among the seven most over-exploited, as the authorities extract 67% of the water for the capital from these aquifers. According to a UN study (2008), Texcoco was the most over-exploited aquifer in the world, with an extraction rate 850% above the annual recharge. On average, the seven aquifers in the CVMC region experience an overexploitation of 200%, which is jeopardising the supply of drinking water in the medium term. 8 Besides these natural conditions of monsoon and drylands, water security is also reduced by societal and political problems. Of the existing 6,800 wells in the CVMC region, only 3,300 are legally authorised, and often metering of the extracted groundwater is altered. Only the shutdown of these illegal wells, transparent metering and adequate pricing of the groundwater extraction may reduce the overexploitation of these aquifers. Such measures would additionally reduce the 8 The recuperation of these seven aquifers is feasible if the valley treats all its sewage water then permits it to re-infiltrate the ground. Harvesting the rainfall, shutting down illegal wells, repairing leaks, tariffs to cover the extraction and treatment costs, and transparent measurement of the real water use may enable the depleted aquifers to recover. From 1925 onwards in Mexico City and the CVMC there has been subsidence in the subsoil, which is affecting the metro, the drainage system and the drinking water pipes, and regions such as Xochimilco and the historical center have lost more than 40 cm. At the international airport, the situation is worse, given a yearly subsidence of 5-30 cm, affecting the landing strips for planes. The reduction in the extraction of 15 m 3 /s would also reduce the content of salts in the water (for instance in Ixtapalapa) and avoid the building of galleries in the ground (Rodr\u00edguez 2011) , which have extreme negative effects during earthquakes.",

Nevertheless, the temporary abundance of water in this region is also creating security challenges due to floods, storms and flash-floods, which seriously affect water, health and livelihood security.

The supporting, regulating, providing and cultural dimension of ecosystem services are basic factors for health security by supporting a material minimum, offering safe food intake, freedom and choice and social relations that may improve life quality and the creation of social networks. Nevertheless, environmental changes and ecosystem impairment, due to anthropogenic over-exploitation of these ecosystem services, create dramatic effects on water and health security. Greater impacts of climate change are also related to forest clearance and land cover change, land degradation, desertification and the loss of natural soil fertility, the drying out of lakes and wetlands, and a chaotic urbanisation process (see Mexico City; Gonz\u00e1lez Reynoso/Zamora Saenz 2011; Dom\u00ednguez 2011) . Biodiversity loss (for instance, during the 1980s the state of Tabasco destroyed about 92% of its tropical rain forest) and the bleaching of coral reefs due to greenhouse gas emissions, acidification of the oceans, and pollution of rivers, lakes and the sea are increasing risks during an extreme event. But landfills and open dumps of garbage also cause direct health impacts though vectors, toxic lixiviation and the development of insects, mice, rats and other dangerous fauna. Floods, heat waves, cold spills, water shortages, landslides, increasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and intoxication of ecosystems and humans related to pollutants (POPs, organic toxics and emerging organic compound; Cort\u00e9s/Calder\u00f3n 2011) are directly affecting health and water security. There also exist ecosystem-mediated impacts, such as the alteration or emergence of risks of infectious diseases. Reduced crop yields associated with poverty, soil depletion, and ignorance have increased malnutrition and the debilitation of the immune system. People get infections and diseases more easily and recover slower. The loss of traditional medicines and the elimination of long-established medical practices, together with a reduction in health personnel as a result of privatisation processes, are creating new vulnerabilities, especially in rural areas and among poor people.",

Among the indirect health and water security aspects, the loss of livelihood related to disasters is important. Temporary and permanent displacements and forced migration often diminish the mental stability of individuals and families, and, confronted with survival threats, community relations often deteriorate. Thus, environmental threats can induce maladaptation and inadequate mitigation processes, increasing the social and environmental risk and sometimes threatening inclusive life quality (slum development in highly risky areas, etc.; Oliver-Smith 2009a, b). Conversely, a critical survival situation may reinforce solidarity at family and community level, thanks to the creation of adaptive practices and local resilience-building.",

At international level, the two Conventions tabled at the Earth Summit in 1992 (UN Convention on Biodiversity, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change), the shortcoming of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and human, health and water security concerns represent complementary tasks for action.

On the top of the policy agenda is water security in terms of a safe water supply for everybody as a basic human right. This signifies that a rational management must take into account the increasing scarcity of the resource, due to population growth, different hygienic conditions, new development processes and climate change.

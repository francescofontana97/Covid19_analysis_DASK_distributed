Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were used as a specific active agent because they reduce the level of holo-ceruloplasmin, the main extracellular cuproenzyme. The mouse model of influenza virus A infection was used with two doses: 1 LD 50 and 10 LD 50 . Three treatment regimens were used: Scheme 1-mice were pretreated 4 days before infection and then every day during infection development; Scheme 2-mice were pretreated four days before infection and on the day of virus infection; Scheme 3-virus infection and AgNP treatment started simultaneously, and mice were injected with AgNPs until the end of the experiment. The mice treated by Scheme 1 demonstrated significantly lower mortality, the protection index reached 60-70% at the end of the experiment, and mean lifespan was prolonged. In addition, the treatment of the animals with AgNPs resulted in normalization of the weight dynamics. Despite the amelioration of the infection, AgNP treatment did not influence influenza virus replication. The possibility of using nanosilver as an effective indirectly-acting antiviral drug is discussed.",

In addition, nanosilver is not incorporated into the active centers of SOD1 and COX, which are vital cytosolic cuproenzymes [45, 48, 49] . Therefore, treatment with AgNPs cannot cause side effects due to the effect on the antioxidant system and oxidative phosphorylation [45, 48, 49] . At the same time, the mechanism of interaction of AgNPs with viruses is a largely unexplored field [50, 51] . Concerning influenza, experiments with AgNPs are mainly limited to in vitro studies [52] [53] [54] , and the publications describing the anti-influenza effect of AgNPs in vivo are limited [55] .",

These measures aim at reducing the incidence of influenza and prevention of the development of its severe forms and complications [5] . The success of both approaches is limited by high genetic variability of the influenza virus, which allows the virus to rapidly gain resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. The recurring antigenic shifts and introduction of new antigenic variants of the influenza virus into the human population greatly reduce the efficiency of vaccination. In this work, an alternative approach is followed. It is based on the \"virocell\" [6] [7] [8] and systems biology concepts [9] [10] [11] . These concepts suggest that the targets for suppressing viral reproduction can be found in the host's metabolism. The present article assesses copper metabolism as a target of antiviral strategy.",

First, copper, being an essential micronutrient, takes part in numerous basic functions in the cell and throughout the body. It is a factor that regulates signaling [12] [13] [14] and apoptosis [15] ; controls the ratio of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation through copper-dependent transcription factors [16] [17] [18] , neovascularization [19] , neurotransmission [20] , proliferation [21] ; and is a co-activator of odorant receptors [22] . Furthermore, copper serves as a catalytic and structural co-factor of vital enzymes that control tissue respiration (cytochrome-c-oxidase, COX), antioxidant protection (Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutases, SOD1 and SOD3), the formation of connective tissue (lysyl oxidases), iron redox reactions Fe(2+) \u2192 Fe(3+) (blue multicopper oxidases), processing of neuropeptides (peptidyl-glycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase), and formation and degradation of the neurotransmitters (dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase and neurospecific copper oxidases) [23] .",

            "text": "Second, copper metabolism was chosen because the processing of the influenza virus genetic program is closely related to changes in copper metabolism of the host cell. Thus, in the early stages of virus reproduction, virus-induced disruption of cytosolic Cu/Zn-SOD formation [24] [25] [26] [27] and antagonism to copper-mediated host innate immune responses are observed [28] . The effect of the influenza virus on host copper metabolism also manifests itself in loss of smell [29] ; this is also true for COVID-19 [30] . In addition, the virus does not multiply in cells with knockdown genes providing copper import into the cell and its transfer to the Golgi complex lumen [31] . Copper in the form of Cu(2+) is required for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of influenza viruses, and for maintaining the structure and functions of viruses [32, 33] . Moreover, the M2 membrane protein of the influenza virus forms a proton-selective ion channel that binds copper ions with high affinity, and is possibly regulated by copper [34] . Additionally, ceruloplasmin (Cp), a major copper-containing extracellular N-glycoprotein, affects the reproduction of the influenza virus in vitro and in vivo in both the early and late stages of multiplication. These experimental data revealed that the action of Cp was realized via its enzymatic activity and the glycan moiety [35] [36] [37] . Serum Cp is a member of the multi-copper blue oxidase family, which also includes hephaestin, zyklopen, and GPI-Cp, bound to the plasma membrane through the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor [38] . Cp belongs to the \"moonlighting\" category of proteins, that is, proteins that display more than one physiologically relevant biochemical or biophysical function within one polypeptide chain [39] . It also belongs to the group of acute-phase proteins. It is the main ferroxidase and extracellular antioxidant copper donor to cells of non-hepatic lineages, and it is involved in the regulation of neutrophil apoptosis [40] [41] [42] . The Cp level in blood serum is the main biomarker of copper status, the indicators of which (copper status indexes: Cp oxidase activity, Cp protein concentration, and atomic copper concentration) characterize the balance of copper in the organism [43] .",

Thus, Cp oxidase activity can be relatively quickly decreased in vivo by treatment with Ag(1+) ions and returned to its normal value by canceling the treatment [44] . This is possible due to the similarity of valence shells of Ag(1+) and Cu(1+), thus Ag(1+) ions are mistakenly bound by copper transporters and passed through copper extracellular and intracellular communication pathways [45] . However, the indexes also quickly return to their normal values by canceling silver ion treatment; since silver, like copper, is rapidly excreted from the body. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have the same mode of action as silver ions because, in organisms, Ag(1+) ions are released from nanoparticles in the process of chemical modification [46, 47] . Silver from the corroding nanoparticles is delivered to the liver; in hepatocytes, it is transferred to the Golgi Mice were randomly divided into eight groups, with 15 mice in each group. These groups comprised: virus control groups (1,5); groups treated by AgNPs (Ag-mice) with scheme 1 (2,6); groups treated by AgNPs with scheme 2 (3,7); and groups treated with AgNPs by scheme 3 (4, 8) . Mice of groups 1 and 5 received virus only. Two study groups of 10 mice in each (group 9 and group 10) were used as controls. Mice of group 9 received no virus but seven injections of AgNPs daily. Mice treated with AgNPs, groups 2-4 and 6-8, were inoculated on day 0 with the virus; they were lightly anesthetized with ether and inoculated intranasally with 50 \u03bcL of PBS containing 1 (groups 2-4) or 10 (groups 6-8) LD50 of SA, divided equally between the nostrils. Sera for determining oxidase activity were taken after 4 (5 mice) and 7 (5 mice) injections of nanosilver. Mice in group 10 did not receive either virus or AgNPs (intact control animals) ( Figure 2 ). Mice were observed daily for body weight loss and lethality up to 14 days post-infection with 1 LD50 and 10 LD50 of lethal SA virus, which were the endpoint of our experiment. Weight loss of less than 10% compared to initial weight was needed before the mice were culled.",

When AgNP treatment was started simultaneously with the influenza virus infection and continued until the end of the experiment (Scheme 3), the oxidase activity in mice was higher than in mice treated according to Scheme 1, but lower than in mice infected according to Scheme 2 ( Figure 5C , bar 2 versus bars 5 (p > 0.05) and 7, p < 0.05). In our work, another biomarker of copper status-the atomic copper concentration-was also measured. It should be borne in mind that the copper concentration and oxidase activity are not absolutely correlated because oxidase activity belongs to Cp only, however, copper is associated with Cp, albumin, and alpha-2-macroglobulin, and also found in low molecular weight substances. In mice, Cp includes about 60% of the total amount of copper [61] versus 95% in humans and rats [62] . In addition, in the sera of mice treated with AgNPs, atomic silver is included in the Cp and bound with alfa-2-macroglobulin. The obtained data are summarized in Table 1 , and show that, considering all of the reservations outlined above, the data are consistent with the results presented in Figure 5 . Thus, the treatment of mice with AgNPs leads to a decrease in copper concentration. Copper content is inversely proportional to processing time. In contrast, the silver concentration increases with increased processing time. In the control group of mice infected with the influenza virus, the concentration of copper increases by about 1.5 times. AgNP treatment results in a decrease in copper concentration and an increase in silver content. These changes depend on the applied AgNP treatment Scheme. Thus, AgNPs, regardless of the infection dose, prevent the dramatic increase in oxidase activity caused by the virus. The intensity of the inhibition oxidase activity in infected mice depends on the treatment Scheme and the dose of infection. The most effective treatment is that according to Scheme 1.",

The AgNP concentration for the treatment of mice was selected so that it was able to significantly lower copper status indexes, while remaining safe for health. It was shown that in Balb/C mice, daily intraperitoneal injections of spherical AgNPs with an average diameter of 20 nm for 9 days at a concentration of 2.5 mg/kg body weight did not cause pathological changes in the morphology of the brain, lungs, heart, and internal organs, with the exception of testicular tissues. Furthermore, in the treated mice, the level of liver enzymes and renal markers in serum did not change [63] . In mice of the same line, a daily injection of 0.4 mg of AgNPs per 1 kg body weight decreased oxidase activity of blood serum by 70% after 3 days [64] . Thus, in this work, mice were treated intraperitoneally with 0.2 mg of AgNPs per 1 kg body mass per day, following the schedules given in Figure 1 . The equivalent silver dose was well below the toxicity threshold for mammalian cells [65] .",

The results are in good agreement with data that show, during influenza infection, the holo-Cp level in the blood increases together with other acute phase proteins and remains high throughout the infection [37, 66] . This fact indicates that the increase in Cp gene expression occurs at the transcriptional level. However, the mechanism of the influenza virus action has not been exactly established. It is known that during influenza infection, the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins 1 and 6, increases [67] [68] [69] .

As we have shown earlier, the AgNP-mediated decrease in Cp oxidase activity occurred because silver atoms displaced copper ions in the Cp active centers during Cp folding in the Golgi complex lumen, and Cp oxidase activity decreased. However, the concentration of Cp-mRNA, the Cp polypeptide level in the Golgi complex, in addition to the secretion rate and half-life of Ag-Cp, did not change [47] . Thus, AgNPs do not affect any of the levels of Cp gene expression. Therefore, AgNPs and the influenza virus influence copper status in two different ways: AgNPs inhibit the formation of Cp active centers and decrease the holo-Cp level, and the influenza virus induces the Cp gene at the level of transcription and promotes the increase in the holo-Cp level.",

The treated mice demonstrated significantly lower mortality and prolonged lifespan compared to untreated infected animals, and the protection index reached 60-70% at the end of the experiment. In addition, the treatment of the animals by AgNPs resulted in the normalization of the weight dynamics of the animals, similar to the results described for oseltamivir (Tamiflu), the most common anti-influenza drug [74] . Moreover, the number of lung lesions per mouse on day 3 decreased by a factor of 6 at a 1 LD 50 infection dose.

Thus, the question arises of how AgNPs inhibit the virus-mediated elevation of oxidase activity. No reliable data are available at present to answer this question. However, indirect evidence exists. First, influenza infection causes an increase in the level of neutrophils in the lungs [75] , the apoptosis of which leads to an increase in the concentration of pro-inflammatory interleukins [69, 76] . Second, holo-Cp induces apoptosis of neutrophils [36] . These data allow us to speculate that, in Ag-mice, the holo-Cp level decreases while Cp protein concentration does not change [47] , and the ratio of holo-Cp/apo-Cp is strongly biased towards apo-Cp, which cannot induce apoptosis of neutrophils [42] . It is possible that the high level of Ag-Cp prevents both neutrophil apoptosis and induction of the activity of its own gene. This assumption needs more research.",

When compared to indirectly acting host-directed experimental antivirals, DAAs have a lower tendency for undesirable side effects. However, acquired resistance of viruses to DAA drugs is a substantial challenge in fields such as clinical practice and virology. From this perspective, screening of IAAs that are independent of the genetic variability and biological properties of the target virus is of importance. The inhibitory effects of nanosilver on the influenza virus in in vitro and in vivo experiments have been shown in a limited number of studies [53] [54] [55] . Our results demonstrate that AgNPs as an IAA can be a viable tool for the development of a formulation that efficiently combats any influenza infection.",

            "text": "In this study, an unparalleled approach to control influenza was developed, based on the restriction of virus infection by shifting the copper balance in the host body using treatment with silver nanoparticles. It is of considerable interest and significance that mice treated with AgNPs were more resistant to infection than control mice. With a continuous presence of AgNPs, significant inhibition and amelioration of H1N1pdm09 influenza infection was observed. Silver nanoparticles administered intraperitoneally at a daily dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight significantly enhanced survival in mice infected with lethal doses of the H1N1pdm09 influenza virus, prevented the development of pathologic lung lesions, and increased life expectancy. A clear dependence of effects on infection dose and time schedule of AgNP application was noted. This study provides support for the view that silver nanoparticles could be used as protection against influenza.

The contemporary impact of larger family size on children's family resources remains an under-explored point of inequity. Larger family size is not only more common among Black and Hispanic children, but Black and Hispanic children in larger families (Black children, especially so) face higher poverty risks relative to White children in larger families. This analysis uses children's number of siblings and children's race and ethnicity to chart the intersectional aspects of disparity in the risk and incidence of poverty and the antipoverty effects of large federal cash supports, the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. It draws upon 2014-2017 Current Population Survey data and the NBER TAXSIM calculator to apply 2018 tax law, inclusive of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. It reveals well-documented disparities in poverty rates and benefit access and receipt experienced by children of color are further exacerbated by policy structures that discriminate against an under-acknowledged aspect of children's family life: their family size. Racial bias in policy design that sees tax credit access mechanisms and earnings and benefit structures disproportionately exclude that Black and Hispanic children also disproportionately exclude Black and Hispanic children by their family size. Without reforms that tackle both inequities, policy action that closes the poverty gap between larger and smaller families will see the racial gap in child poverty remain.",

Differences in large family size trends across racial and ethnic groups functioned as an added axis of disparity among children in the US well into the twentieth century before patterns converged in recent decades (Fahey 2017) . Despite smaller family norms today, larger family size (defined as 3 or more children) remains an important feature of children's circumstances in the United States (US). Today, 35% of children under the age of 18 grow up in families of 3 or more co-resident children. In many ways, children in the modern larger family resemble the child population as a whole, but the impact of larger family size on children's family resources-specifically income-remains an important but under-explored contemporary point of inequity. As this article details, larger family size is not only more common among Black and Hispanic children, but Black and Hispanic children in larger families (Black children, especially so) face higher poverty risks relative to White children in larger families.",

The worst of this attention fed the UK and US eugenics movement, which spread throughout Europe and beyond (Cot 2005; Haas 2008; Leonard 2003) . Over 30 US states enacted laws to force the sterilization of socially disadvantaged groups-with Black Americans, Native Americans, and Puerto Ricans as particular targets (Raine 2012; Price et al. 2020) . As the US welfare state expanded through the twentieth century-mainly in a means-tested way for families with children-the spotlight on lower income family fertility became increasingly intertwined with public benefits access; the late 1960s saw a US Senator infamously refer to welfare rights activists as 'brood mares' (Minoff 2020) . Social policy eventually turned towards lone parenthood, but family size policy and racial and ethnic discrimination links remained. Purported concern over 'out of wedlock' births informed the Republican Party's Contract with America and led to President Clinton's 1996 welfare reform, itself culmination of years of heavily racialized and gendered debate (Orloff 2002 )-a core tenet of which was the denial of cash assistance to new babies born.",

Bradshaw et al (2006) , as well as Willitts and Swales (2003) and Iacovou and Berthoud (2006) for the UK Department of Work and Pensions, all identify large family size as a meaningful contributor to child poverty in the UK at the start of the twentyfirst century. In mid-2020, the Irish Department of Children and Youth Affairs released a new income and poverty baseline identifying the 'number of children in the household'specifically, three or more children-as a key poverty risk.",

The Earned Income Tax Credit is capped at three children (though this was expanded from a twochild maximum in 2009) and the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit remains capped at two children. The Child Tax Credit ostensibly offers per-child benefits, but-as this article discusses-earnings requirements mean large families have to earn more than small families to receive the full benefit . As of 2018, fourteen states maintained a family cap as part of their Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, disqualifying any child born after program receipt had begun to be included in the benefit payment (Thomhave 2018) . Family caps continue to be proposed with respect to cash assistance: although warnings child poverty could reach its highest level in 50 years amidst the COVID-19 pandemic , the US Congress repeatedly proposed capping emergency payments at a maximum of three children. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) adjusts benefits by family size, but larger families are more likely to be extramarginal consumers-their food spending is less than or equal to the amount of SNAP benefits received and this is likely due to budget constraint rather than preference (Johnson et al 2018; Hoynes et al 2015) . Gundersen et al. (2018) flag large families as a group for consideration in any future SNAP reform.",

Research indicates both credits help advance racial equity, particularly among women and children of color, as they serve larger proportions of both (Huang and Taylor 2019; Sherman and Mitchell 2017) . At the same time, children's rate of receipt remains uneven across racial and ethnic groups. At the start of the twenty-first century, low-income Hispanic families were less than half as likely than low-income non-Hispanic families to have heard of or received the Earned Income Tax Credit (Ross Phillips 2001) . Hispanic families saw decreased participation over the next decade (Jones 2014 ) and continue to be less likely to receive the EITC today (Thomson et al 2020) . One-third of all children do not receive the full Child Tax Credit because their parents earn too little, but children of color are twice as likely to be left out; over 50% of all Black and Hispanic children are left behind, compared to 23% of White, non-Hispanic children .",

To take recent US data (Shkolnikov et al. 2007 ), 30% of women just past the point of childbearing in 2007 had borne three or more children; yet among the children of these women, more than half (56%) were in families of three or more siblings. The underlying concept here was first set out by Preston (1976) who identified that, as a matter of group averages, children's family size (i.e.. sibling size or sibsize) cannot be read off from the family size of their parents-the former is larger than the latter, sometimes by a wide margin. Table 1 demonstrates the way in which family-level figures understate the prevalence of large family size among children. One-fifth (20%) of families with children are larger families-those with three or more co-resident children under the age of 18. Of all children under the age of 18, however, more than one-third (35%) live in larger families. A child-centered measure better captures the fact that larger family size is a more common family form for children than is often realized. For children, this is important because their sibsize represents the number of siblings with whom family resources (parental time, energy, material items, and income) must be shared. Resource dilution has a long history in the literature (Becker 1964; Blake 1989) and is implicitly accounted for in contemporary income poverty measurement through the matter of equivalence, but not usually with a focus on the impact of large family size today. Gibbs et al (2016) proffer an update to the traditional resource dilution model that links large family size with more negative child outcomes: family size effects on children are tempered by the community and state-level contexts in which they live and public policy has a particular impact.",

It understands children under 18 to be those classified as dependents for tax purposes and the household to be the family tax unit, both categories as identified by tax pointers within the CPS ASEC data. It remains an open question in the literature as to what constitutes a 'large' family today. The definition of 'larger' family size, here, is set at three or more co-resident children. Three children, as seen in Table 1 , are above the US mean children's family size and coincide with the family size threshold in the Earned Income Tax Credit under current law. The three-child threshold also has support in the literature from Willitts and Swales (2003) and Kemp et al (2004) , among others, though Iacovou and Berthoud (2006) and Curran (2019) make the case for a fourchild threshold. Bradshaw et al (2006) , in a national review of child poverty in large families in the UK on behalf of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, asserts a preference for the large family definition at four or more children, but-in recognition of the flexibility in the term-reports results for families with three or more and four or more children. This article takes a similar approach, using an umbrella category of 'larger' to represent families with three or more dependent children under the age of 18 in the home as compared to smaller families (those with 1 or 2). However, it also breaks out 'larger' family results into those with three children only and those with four children or more to identify any underlying trends. Table 2 identifies the sample size used in the analysis, across years, race and ethnicity, and family size.",

Four categories are used: 'Black,' 'Hispanic,' 'Other,' and 'White'; the 'Other' category also employs an imperfect term and a broad one, encompassing individuals who identify as Asian, Native American, multi-racial, and more. Future work in this area, using data with sample sizes that allow for a specific look at smaller population groups and regional patterns, where relevant, would be a useful complement to this analysis. Results are not interpreted as causal (i.e., does a particular race/ethnic category cause large family size or income poverty status) (Holland 2008 ; Bonilla-Silva and Zuberi 2008); rather they function as contextual elements in the discussion of patterns of association regarding the family features most associated with contemporary large family size and children's experience of large family income poverty today.",

Similar to the findings of Curran (2019), children in larger families are spread in similar fashion across geographic regions. Children in larger families are also more likely (by a difference of 6 percentage points) to live in twoparent families. Larger families report lower levels of maternal education and maternal work compared to smaller families. But perhaps most notable is difference in SPM poverty levels among children in smaller families (12.9%) and children in larger families (17.8%)-a difference of 5 percentage points (and a 28% gap) across the two groups. Table 4 examines the risk of SPM poverty for all children in the US across different family sizes and racial and ethnic groups. The risk of SPM poverty among children in larger families (18%) is higher than in smaller families (13%). This is true across racial and ethnic groups, with a more pronounced family size poverty gap for Black and Hispanic children. Looking within larger families, it is clear than SPM poverty rates among children in four-plus child families which are consistently higher than rates in three-child families-likely contributing to a portion of the family size poverty gap for children across groups. Even absent these family size differences, though, a racial poverty gap for children is evident: in both larger and smaller families, the SPM poverty rate among Black and Hispanic children is approximately two and a half times higher than it is for White children. Black children in larger families face the highest poverty risk of all groups examined. As such, it is of interest to understand how anti-poverty policy intersects with both children's race and ethnicity and children's family size.",

            "text": "For children, the earnings structure of the Child Tax Credit is arguably the most problematic element. Excluding those on the lowest incomes hampers the credit's antipoverty effectiveness, while also leaving out children in particular family types and circumstances. Recent work from Columbia University Collyer 2019) demonstrates the ways in which the CTC earnings requirement and phase-in disproportionately exclude Black and Hispanic children, children in single-parent households, and those in certain regions of the country (e.g., South). Less well known is that fact that, despite ostensibly offering per-child benefits, the CTC also disadvantages children in larger families, leaving them out at greater rates. Nearly half of all children in larger families, compared to less than onethird in smaller families, do not receive the full Child Tax Credit because their earnings fall below the income thresholds for their family size . As seen in Fig. 1 , a family with two adults and two children needs at Bold values indicate the difference, for the reader, between the results for 'all' children (e.g. the entire US child population) and the results for children in each individual racial and ethnic category if they added a third child to their family, they would require almost 20% more in earnings ($42,000) in order to maintain access to the full credit. A family with four children needs to earn 30% more than a family with two children in order to access the full credit. As noted earlier-and like the CTC-children's receipt of the EITC remains uneven across racial and ethnic groups. Hispanic children, in particular, are less likely to access it. In contrast to the CTC, the EITC has long operated under a family cap structure. It currently recognizes just four family size types: those with zero, one, two, and three dependents (with a higher income threshold in each category for married families compared to families who file as single or head of household tax units). Due to the phase-in structure of the current credit, families with two or more children must earn closer to 30% more than families with one child to access the maximum credit amount ($14,800 versus $10,540 in earnings, respectively). At the same time, the maximum credit begins phasing out at the same income threshold ($19,330) for all families of children, regardless of size. As Fig. 2 shows, this results in multi-child families having a narrower window (in terms of their level of earnings) in which they can access the full Earned Income Tax Credit than families with one child. The maximum credit amounts also vary by family size, to the detriment of children in larger families. Moving from a family of one child to a family of two children, the maximum credit amount increases by 40% ($3,584 to $5,920). Moving from a family of two children to a family of three or more children, however, the maximum credit amount increases by just 11 percent ($5,920 to $6,660). without the Earned Income Credit; or the absence of both credits together. Figure 3 shows that the two credits together actually reduce poverty at greater rates for larger families than smaller ones: without them, smaller family poverty would be 29% higher than it currently is and larger family poverty would be 36% higher. Even so, distinct disparities in the poverty rates by children's race and ethnicity and family size remain.",

Proposed changes to the Child Tax Credit gaining recent traction center around the removal of the earnings requirement (as shown in Fig. 1 ) to transform the credit into a fully refundable one. This change would see that all families below the income phase-out income threshold receive the maximum benefit per child. Other proposals would couple a fully refundable structure with higher maximum benefit levels for children who receive it (NAS 2019; Shaefer 2018) . Similar to Fig. 3 , each column in Fig. 4 represents the different levels of SPM poverty for children in smaller and larger families across racial and ethnic groups under two versions of proposed, but not enacted, alternatives to the Child Tax Credit. Option 1 ('Alt CTC v1\u2032) would remove the Child Tax Credit earnings requirement, delivering a fully refundable $2000 credit to all income-eligible dependents under 17 under current law. Option 2 ('Alt CTC v2\u2032) would remove the Child Tax Credit earnings requirement and couple this with increased maximum credit amounts (here, along the lines of the American Family Act, S.690/H.R.1560 in the 116 th US Congress; a one-year version was passed by the US House of Representatives in May 2020 as part of the HEROES Act of 2020 (H.R.6800)) of a fully refundable credit valued at $3000 per income-eligible dependent aged 6 to 16 and $3600 for those under 6 years old. These proposals are modeled here because they specifically tackle the structural barriers for larger families (e.g., the earnings requirement as seen in Fig. 1 ). Modeling existing proposals for the Earned Income Tax Credit were considered, but no popular proposal at the moment currently tackles the particular issues in this credit related to family sizehere: the family size cap, disparity in the earnings phasein, or equity in the maximum benefits across families with children. This issue is taken up further in the discussion.",

Combining full refundability with higher benefit levels (Option 2) would cut smaller family poverty by over one-quarter and larger family poverty by half-resulting in SPM poverty rates for children in larger families across all racial and ethnic groups that are lower than those in smaller family ones.

Yet both credits also treat children in families of different sizes differently within their credit structures-to the distinct disadvantage of children in larger families. Larger families must earn more than smaller families to access the maximum credit amounts; yet, larger families do not necessarily earn more than smaller families (Curran 2019; Curran and Collyer 2020). In leaving out those on the lowest incomes and requiring higher earnings from larger families to access the maximum credit, the CTC compounds disadvantage. Black and Hispanic children are more likely to live in families with lower incomes, are more likely to live in larger families, and those in larger families face the highest poverty risk. Current CTC policy does reduce larger family poverty in general, but notable racial and ethnic disparities in poverty rates for children remain. Policy alternatives that would increase eligibility and benefit levels would support children across family sizes and racial and ethnic groups, but a racial gap in poverty would remain. The current structure of the EITC works to the disadvantage of children in larger families in a different way. By capping the credit at a maximum of three children, children higher in the birth order are effectively unrecognized by one of the primary vehicles for delivering family income support in the US. This cap places additional strain on all children in large families (with 4 + children), as the credit meant for three children must stretch further than designed. The narrower earnings window at which larger families are eligible for the maximum EITC benefit and the uneven credit increases between family sizes (e.g., a 40% increase in the maximum credit value when moving from a 1-child family to a 2-child family, but only an 11% increase in the maximum credit value when moving from a 2-child family to a 3-child family) does not adequately reflect the resource needs of families of larger size, while also resulting in children with siblings being penalized-with respect to EITC receiptcompared to children without.",

To this end, future research on the efficacy of the safety net for children in larger families could benefit from a more regional focus-particularly to understand the intersection of family size, race, and place in the delivery of public supports.",

As such, these findings lend support to existing calls for added elements to policy reform that more specifically help address the long history of racial inequity in the US that remain evident in children's outcomes and close the racial gap in child poverty.",

Its narrow focus examines the two largest federal family tax credits, specifically because they represent cash income for families, are proven to have a substantial impact on child poverty (Fox 2020) , and operate uniformly across the country. SNAP, TANF, and housing assistance (public housing or Sect. 8 vouchers, for example) are all examples of additional programs worthy of investigation in this framework and modeling proposed changes in these programs-in combination with the Child Tax Credit alternatives looked at here and the inclusion of an alternative Earned Income Tax Credit structure for larger families-would likely shed additional light on the interplay between children's family size and race and ethnicity in general, as well as what policy reforms can help close the racial and ethnic gap in poverty more specifically. Research indicates that particular combinations of safety net programs (e.g., tax credits plus housing assistance) are additive in their poverty reduction impact . In other words, each program plays a particular poverty reduction role-rather than one policy effect replacing the other when combined. As such, including these programs in future investigations could lend additional nuance and insight to the observations made here. To do so properly, though, state variation in these three policy areas (including differences in benefit levels and family caps) needs to be taken into account.",

Measures tracking how families fare amidst the crisis have not often been broken out by family size, but given the notably higher rates of income poverty among children in larger families in the years pre-pandemic, it is likely children in larger families face elevated risks of hardship now. Further exacerbating the situation, particularly for Hispanic children in larger families, there were immigrant exclusions from emergency cash assistance in the early rounds of federal pandemic relief packages and unemployment benefit expansions. Congressional negotiations around pandemic emergency assistance in the spring and summer of 2020 also saw repeated proposals to cap emergency cash payments at a maximum of three children. Additional pandemic-related assistance may still be delivered, and family caps remain a potential concern.",

Myocardial dysfunction is associated with the severity of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) after infection and is the major cause of death in children with septic shock [7, 18] . Infections can trigger SIRS by activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-jB), which is the main transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes encoding inflammatory mediators [12] . These mediators have been implicated in the genesis of sepsis-related myocardial dysfunction [18, 26, 27] , which may contribute to the development of multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome [8, 25, 29] . In addition, greater NF-jB activation has been observed in adults with septic shock who died [1, 4] . However, the association between NF-jB activation, sepsis-related myocardial dysfunction, and mortality has not been investigated in children. Improved knowledge on the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction associated with sepsis may lead to novel therapeutic approaches.

It has been showed that TNF-a and IL-1b were responsible for the depression of myocardial cell contractility in vitro induced by human septic shock serum [18] . In contrast, serum from septic shock adults that induced a decrease of cardiomyocyte contractility in vitro had high levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10; however, the concentrations of TNF-a and IL-1b were not increased [16] . IL-6 isolated from serum obtained from children with meningococcal septicemia impaired in vitro myocardial contractility [26] . TNF-a added to IL-6 had negative inotropic activity in vitro after prolonged exposure ([48 h) [27] . Our data add to the evidence that TNF-a and IL-10 are involved in myocardial contractile dysfunction associated with septic shock. Moreover, we observed greater levels of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-10 in patients with catecholamine-refractory shock, and there was an association between TNF-a levels and mortality. In children with septic shock, serum levels of TNF and IL-10 measured at admission to the PICU were related to the severity of organ failure and mortality [13] . Taken together, these findings suggest that inflammation is associated with disease severity and outcome of children with septic shock. Interestingly, experimental studies have showed that in addition to the systemic release of cytokines, cardiomyocytes can also generate cytokines locally in the heart in response to Gram-positive sepsis and lipopolysaccharide administration, which could aggravate sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction [14, 17, 20] .

Moreover, a positive correlation has been observed between the percentage of cells exhibiting NF-jB activity and serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 [15] . In contrast, NF-jB activity, as evaluated by gene expression of its inhibitor, I-jBa, was not associated with myocardial dysfunction or mortality in our study. In theory, I-jBa mRNA quantification would be a more accurate marker of the transcriptional strength of NF-jB [5] . EMSA, which visualizes the binding of NF-jB to synthetic oligonucleotides, does not necessarily reflect the transcriptional power of NF-jB because it can be modified after NF-jB DNA binding by phosphorylation or interaction with cofactors [5] . However, several substances can influence I-jBa mRNA levels, such as corticosteroids, which lead to increased transcription of the gene for I-jBa [2] .

            "text": "Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an established anti-malarial medication and a pH-dependent autophagy inhibitor. Recently, its anti-tumor function has been described wherein HCQ treatment reversed immune evasion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by upregulating MHC-I surface expression on tumor cells and promoted tumor recognition by cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, resulting in responsiveness to anti-CTLA4 + anti-PD1 therapy (Yamamoto et al., 2020) . Furthermore, IL-2 alone is an efficient immunotherapy in an advanced murine metastatic liver tumor model. IL-2 inhibits tumor growth by enhancing immune cell proliferation and infiltration in the liver and spleen; however, the anti-tumor effects of IL-2 immunotherapy significantly heighten when coupled with administration of autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ) . Similarly, in renal cell carcinoma, CQ is used to improve IL-2-mediated anti-tumor immunity by enhancing dendritic cell, T-cell, and natural killer cell function and limiting ATP production through inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and promotion of apoptosis . More importantly, an interaction between autophagy and immune checkpoints has been identified. In both in vitro melanoma and ovarian cancer models and using in vivo NSG (Non-obese diabetic scid gamma) mouse models, PD-L1 attenuated autophagy by blunting the ability of autophagy inhibitors to limit tumor proliferation (Clark et al., 2016) . Furthermore, PD-L1 attenuation elevated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, an autophagy inhibitor (Clark et al., 2016) . These findings suggest that HCQ may enhance ICI therapy against cancer.",

In the context of cancer, autophagy limits immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Rao et al., 2014) , and the loss of autophagy genes promote tumor inflammation (Degenhardt et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2013) . Most immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) under investigation block one of three immune checkpoint molecules (PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA4) on cancer or immune cells. This way, ICIs unleash the adaptive immune system and lead to an effective anti-tumor immune response (Wei et al., 2018) . This mechanism may be impaired by the immunosuppressive actions of HCQ.",

Splenocytes from naive mice were stimulated with PMA (Phorbol myristate acetate)/ionomycin in the presence of HCQ for 4 hr to test the immediate effects of HCQ on T-cell function ( Figures 1A-1D ). IFNg and TNFa production by T cells were measured by intracellular flow cytometry. HCQ caused a dose-dependent reduction of IFNg and TNFa production in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells ( Figures 1A-1D , exemplary gating strategy shown in Figure S1A ). At the 20mM concentration, we observed a strong inhibition of T-cell cytokine production. Next, we studied the effect of 2 hr (h) of HCQ pretreatment on T-cell stimulation ( Figures  1E-1H) . Again, HCQ pretreatment reduced TNFa production in CD4 + T cells ( Figure 1F ) and CD8 + T cells ( Figure 1H ) in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of IFNg was present in CD4 + T cells but not in CD8 + T cells ( Figures 1E and 1G ). We repeated these experiments using murine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Again, we observed a consistent inhibition of IFNg and TNFa production by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells when PBMCs were stimulated and simultaneously treated with HCQ (Figures S1C-S1F). Pretreatment of PBMCs with HCQ led to a decrease of TNFa but not IFNg production (Figures S1G-S1J).",

Three tumor-bearing mouse models including MC38 and RIL-175 in C57BL/6 mice and CT26 in BALB/c mice were chosen based on previous publications and our results (Brown et al., 2018; Homet Moreno et al., 2016) . Tumor cells were injected subcutaneously, and HCQ treatment was started when tumors were established (5 days). Mice received three doses of anti-PD1 (day 7, 10, and 15), and tumor growth was followed until day 19 ( Figure 3A ). Consistent with previous reports, anti-PD1 treatment effectively impaired tumor growth in all three subcutaneous tumor models ( Figures 3B-3G) . A single treatment of HCQ promoted tumor size growth of subcutaneous MC38 tumor but had no significant effect on subcutaneous CT-26 or RIL-175 tumor ( Figures 3B-3D) . The increased size of the MC38 tumor was confirmed by tumor weights at the endpoint ( Figure 3G ). Importantly, in all three models, HCQ and anti-PD1 combination treatment led to higher tumor weights compared to anti-PD1 single treatment ( Figures 3E-3G ). Using three tumor lines in two mouse strains, our results clearly demonstrate that HCQ treatment can impair the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy.",

To support this hypothesis, we isolated and analyzed splenocytes from MC38 tumor-bearing mice treated with anti-PD1 G HCQ. The expression of activation marker CD69 on both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells was greatly increased in the anti-PD1 treatment group ( Figures 4A and 4B , exemplary gating strategy is shown in Figure S1B ). The addition of HCQ treatment completely blocked the CD69 increase when compared to combination treatment. T-cell function was further analyzed using intercellular cytokine flow cytometry analysis after ex vivo PMA/ionomycin stimulation. Upon anti-PD1 treatment, both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells produced significantly more IFNg and TNFa ( Figures 4C-4F ). Anti-PD1 in combination with HCQ did not reduce IFNg and TNFa production in CD8 + T cells ( Figures  4C and 4D ). In CD4 + T cells, the combination therapy decreased IFNg but not TNFa production ( Figures  4E and 4F ).",

In the context of autoimmune disease, HCQ inhibits immune function through many mechanisms such as alterations in autophagy and lysosomal pH (Hu et al., 2017) . For example, autophagy and lysosomal function in dendritic cells is an important mechanism by which MHC-II antigens are processed and presented. The blockage of autophagy and rising lysosomal pH impairs MHC-II presentation and thus the function of CD4+ T cells (Schmidt et al., 2017) . In the context of cancer, MHC-II antigen presentation and CD4+ T cells response are an important component of anti-tumor immunity, as well as response to ICIs. Furthermore, HCQ can inhibit the secretion of important cytokines such as IFNg, TNFa, and IL-6 (Alspach et al., 2019) . These studies suggest that the use of HCQ may inhibit anti-tumor response, especially when using ICIs.",

Studies in mice have shown that CQ and HCQ can induce a shift from immunosuppressive M2-tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to immune-promoting M1-TAMs, which may sensitize glioblastoma to anti-PD1 treatment (Hsu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018) . A recent report showed that inhibiting autophagy reversed the downregulation of MHC-I surface expression on pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, CQ sensitized otherwise ICI therapy-insensitive pancreas cancer to dual treatment with anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 (Yamamoto et al., 2020) , suggesting that CQ can potentially improve ICIs. However, the study did not test the direct effect of CQ on anti-tumor immunity and did not address its influence on ICI therapy-sensitive cancer. Of note, the study observed that CQ failed to boost anti-PD1 monotherapy against pancreatic cancer. Other reports using tumor models without downregulated MHC-I expression showed that genetic inhibition of autophagy or the use of HCQ had no improved function of T cells in tumor-bearing mice (Starobinets et al., 2016) . Taken together, these studies paint an unclear picture of how the immunosuppressive drugs, HCQ and CQ, affect the adaptive immune response in the context of ICIs.",

We demonstrate that HCQ impairs the production of proinflammatory cytokines in mice bearing various tumor types. We also show that HCQ reduces the number of macrophages and dendritic cells, which likely impairs a robust T-cell response. Finally, we found that MHC-I surface expression was only increased in a subset of tumor cell types, indicating significant heterogeneity within different tumor cell lines.

All experiments were conducted according to local institution guidelines and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA. HCQ was obtained from the NIH clinical center pharmacy.Animal studies Subcutaneous injections were performed in 8-week-old C57BL/6 and BALB/c female mice. 1x10 6 CT26 or MC38 or RIL-175 cells were re-suspended in 100\u00b5L of PBS and the tumor cell suspension was injected in the lateral flank. All mice were randomized prior to initiation of treatment. Mice (n=5-8 per group) were then treated 5 days after injection with either vehicle control (saline), daily gavage of 25mg/kg HCQ or 200\u00b5g anti-PD-1 (clone 29F.1A12, BioXCell) on days 7, 10, 15. One group received combined treatment with both HCQ and anti-PD1. Tumor size was measured by diameter and mice were sacrificed at day 20 post tumor cell injection. Tumors were then excised and weighed. Tumor weights were compared between groups and lymphocytes were isolated from spleens and tumors for further flowcytometry analysis. Numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes were counted by flow cytometry and divided by tumor weight (g). For the immune profiling experiments, non-tumor bearing mice (n=5 per group) were treated with vehicle control or daily gavage of 25mg/kg HCQ. Mice were sacrificed at day 6 and splenic lymphocytes were isolated.",

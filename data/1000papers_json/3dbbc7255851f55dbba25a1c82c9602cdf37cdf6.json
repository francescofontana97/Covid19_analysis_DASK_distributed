Alveolar macrophages (AM) are the first cells of the innate immune system that engage Mtb, but how HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) impact on the antimycobacterial response of AM is not known. To investigate the impact of HIV and ART on the transcriptomic and epigenetic response of AM to Mtb, we obtained AM by bronchoalveolar lavage from 20 PLWH receiving ART, 16 control subjects who were HIV-free (HC), and 14 subjects who received ART as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection.",

Compared to HC subjects, AM isolated from PLWH and PrEP subjects presented a substantially weaker transcriptional response. Further investigation of chromatin structure revealed that AM from control subjects challenged with Mtb responded with pronounced accessibility changes in over ten thousand regions. In stark contrast, AM obtained from PLWH and PrEP subjects displayed no significant changes in their chromatin state in response to Mtb. Collectively, these results revealed a previously unknown adverse effect of ART on the epigenetic landscape and transcriptional responsiveness of AM.",

In 2018, there were an estimated 1.45 million deaths caused by TB, which included 250,000 people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (1). Of the estimated 10 million people who fell ill with TB, 850,000 were persons living with HIV (PLWH) indicating a 2.2-fold increased risk of death due to TB in HIV-positive relative to HIV-negative persons. Globally, the proportion of notified HIV-positive TB cases on antiretroviral therapy was 86% with large gaps among countries (1). However, even people on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) still have significantly increased risk of developing TB (2) , which is usually the result of new infection rather than reactivation of latent TB (3) (4) (5) (6) .",

However, only 4 out of 20 subjects had not received TDF at the time of enrolment ( Table 1) . Most of the inter-subject variability was accounted for by the analytical approach employed. Still, given the strong heterogeneity of study subjects we investigated the impact of smoking, recreational drug use and age on Mtb-triggered chromatin .

We found that recreational drug use did not explain the reduced transcriptional activity or absence of chromatin changes in response to Mtb among PLWH and PrEP subjects ( Fig. 1F and Fig. 4A ). Age and duration of ART/PrEP were also unlikely confounders since PLWH and PrEP subjects differed significantly in age and ART duration, yet both groups showed similar reduced transcriptional activity and lack of chromatin changes relative to HC subjects following challenge with Mtb (Fig. 4, B and C) . Moreover, when stratifying HC and PLWH by age, HC subjects of 40 years and older showed pronounced Mtbtriggered chromatin changes that were not observed for PLWH subjects (Fig. 4D) . In addition to the covariates listed in Table 1 , we also considered possible group-dependent differences in phagocytic activity. Since the yields of AM were generally not sufficient to conduct independent assessment of phagocytic activity, we used presence of Mtb reads in ATAC-seq libraries as proxy and failed to detect any significant group-dependent differences (Fig. 4E) .",

Of the 57 up-regulated DEGs with IRF9 TSS footprint, 17 were part of the IFN or TNF pathways, including NOD2 and ISG15 (Fig. 5D) . Collectively, these data showed that the epigenetic response observed in AM from HC subjects promoted the binding of key transcriptions factors required for IFN and TNF signalling. The locked state of chromatin in AM from PLWH and PrEP subjects was therefore likely to account, at least in part, for the reduced transcriptional activity of those cells in response to Mtb.",

Consequently, much of our knowledge about the Mtb-host interplay from inhalation to the development of acquired T cell immunity has been derived from observations in animal models. In the mouse, Mtb bacilli in the lung alveoli are taken up by AM (7). Infected AM function as niche for Mtb replication prior to the migration of Mtb-infected AM to the lung interstitium where Mtb are transferred to inflammatory macrophages that facilitate the induction of Mtb-specific T cell immunity (7) .

In our study we found no evidence for reduced phagocytic uptake of Mtb by AM across phenotypic groups. This is consistent with previous reports that AM obtained from PLWH showed no defect in phagocytosis of Salmonella Typhimurium compared to HIVnegative controls (19) . AM from PLWH on long term ART displayed a decreased ability to kill Streptococcus pneumoniae due to their HIV gp120-mediated reduced AM apoptotic activity (20, 21) . Consistent with this finding, reduced AM phagocytic activity of Staphylococcus aureus in a sample of PLWH/ART subjects was associated with detectable proviral DNA (22) . In our sample we found that 6 out of the 7 tested PLWH subjects had undetectable proviral counts arguing against a role of provirus in our sample (23) . Moreover, the differences in the transcriptional response to Mtb between the PrEP and PLWH groups were less pronounced as compared to the differences of both groups to HC participants which argues against HIV being the main cause of the blunted anti-Mtb response by AM.",

While the observed increased TF binding in DOC/DAc regions is consistent with the idea of the chromatin lock-down being the cause of the reduced transcriptional response, this causality remains to be more stringently established. Irrespective of the precise mechanisms, the blunted ability of AM to mount a response to an infectious insult may contribute to the known increased vulnerability to pulmonary disease of PLWH. For example, the prevalence of bacterial pneumonias and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are significantly increased in PLWH/ART patients (24, 25) . PLWH/ART patients also experience an increased risk of sepsis with poor outcome (26) . However, a more direct link of our findings can be made with TB for which PLWH on long term ART who have been immunereconstituted remain at increased risk (2, 17) . Since our data suggest that the blunted AM response to Mtb is predominantly mediated by the anti-viral drugs and not the virus, use of PrEP in settings of high TB transmission might require to consider the risk of TB versus protection from HIV. To our knowledge, no data are presently available that link PrEP with risk of TB. We note, however, that PrEP has been associated with reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in Spain (27, 28) . Efficient infection of epithelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the virus induced up-regulation of its ACE2 receptor (29) . If the impact of PrEP on chromatin .

White dots represent mean log2FC for subjects who do not smoke cigarettes or used cannabis, while black dots depict smokers and/or cannabis users. To derive the subject mean log2FC, we used pooled DEG from the first two columns in panel E which were significant for interaction contrasts PLWH vs HC and PrEP vs HC, obtained subject-wise log2FC for each DEG and averaged the log2FC from all genes per subject. Results showed that group differences are not driven by outliers and that smoking, or cannabis consumption do not explain group differences. .

            "text": "The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the McGill University Health Center (MUHC) (MP-CUSM-15-406). Participants were recruited at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC, Montreal, Canada). HIV negative participants represented a control group (n=23) and a high-risk group on preventive therapy (PrEP, n=14). HIV positive participants (PLWH, n=27) were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress peripheral viral load for at least 3 years and without any active respiratory symptoms or infections. Exclusion criteria included past history of TB, pregnancy, chronic cardiovascular or active pulmonary infection and immunosuppressive medication. All participants were tested with QuantiFERON Gold, Cat#0594-2010/Cat#T0590-0301 (Qiagen, Germany) and one subject each of the HC and PrEP groups tested positive. Since exclusion of these two subjects had no significant impact on reported results, we left them included in the present presentation of the data. Information on participant characteristics and antiretroviral drugs was extracted from the clinical database and participant electronic records. Of these enrolled subjects, we excluded 7 HC and 7 PLWH from the analyses due to low yield of BAL cells, or inability to pass quality control for sample or library preparation. Bronchoalveolar lavage and sample processing performed at the Centre for Innovative Medicine of the Research Institute of the MUHC following the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (30). Briefly, standard flexible bronchoscopy of the middle lobe was conducted under local anesthesia with lidocaine with additional conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam. A total of 200 ml sterile saline instilled in 50-ml volumes resulted in an average return of 115 ml (range of 50-150 ml) of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. BAL fluid in non-adherent tubes was stored on ice for a maximum of 30 min prior to the isolation of AM. All BAL fluids were strained through a 100\u03bcm filter to remove any mucus and cell clumps. Cytology assessment of BAL samples indicated that AM represented >90% of all recovered mononuclear cells. Alveolar macrophage preparation AM were isolated by adhesion. Collected BAL cells were spun for 10 minutes at 300g, 10\u00b0C, and washed twice in RPMI-1640 with L-glutamine (Wisent, Canada), containing 2% human serum (heat-inactivated AB+ off the clot, Wisent, Canada), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, USA), 10mM HEPES (Gibco, USA), 1% Non-essential amino acids (Gibco, USA) and 1.75ng/ml Amphotericin B (Wisent, Canada). After the cell count, 1.5x10 6 AM were seeded per well of a 6-well plate (Falcon, USA) in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% human serum and incubated for 1.5h-2h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, and 95% relative humidity. Non-adherent cells were removed by thorough washings with pre-warmed (37\u00b0C) RPMI-1640 supplemented with 2% human serum. Washed adherent AM were then infected with freshly prepared Mtb. An estimate for the number of adherent AM was derived by subtracting the number of detached from the number of seeded cells. Mycobacterial cultures and macrophage challenge in vitro albumin-dextrose-catalase (ACD, Fisher) at 37\u00b0C in rolling incubators. Bacteria were grown to log phase, as determined by an optical density of 0.3 to 0.8 at 600nm, prior to inoculum preparation. Further, bacterial cultures were spun for 15 minutes at 3700 rpm, resuspended in RPMI-1640 and dislodged with a 22G needle. Cell suspensions were filtered through 5\u03bcm filters (Millipore, USA) to ensure single mycobacteria suspensions for the challenge experiments. Bacterial counts of inocula were done using disposable Neubauer hemocytometer (C-Chip, INCYTO, South Korea). Bacterial loads were confirmed by colony-forming unit (CFU) counts by plating serial dilution of inoculum in 7H9 growth medium on Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA, #254520) plates containing 0.5% glycerol (Fisher) and 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA, #211886). Colonies were counted 3-4 weeks post-plating. AM were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5:1 for 18-20hrs 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, and 95% relative humidity.",

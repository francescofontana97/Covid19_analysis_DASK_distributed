In contrast to their universality, the investigation of reactions between quinones and proteins remains sparse. Herein, we report the development of a convenient strategy to protein modification via a biomimetic quinonemediated oxidation at the N-terminus. By exploiting unique reactivity of an ortho-quinone reagent, the \u03b1-amine of protein N-terminus is oxidized to generate aldo or keto handle for orthogonal conjugation. The applications have been demonstrated using a range of proteins, including myoglobin, ubiquitin and small ubiquitin-related modifier 2 (SUMO2). The effect of this method is further highlighted via the preparation of a series of 17 macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b2 (MIP-1\u03b2) analogs, followed by preliminary anti-HIV activity and cell viability assays, respectively. This method offers an efficient and complementary approach to existing strategies for N-terminal modification of proteins.",

In line with the broad interest in the development of selective and mild oxidation reactions, orthoquinone cofactors of copper amine oxidases (CuAOs) have been extensively studied due to their high catalytic efficiency. In the catalytic cycle, the Tyr side chain is converted into lysyl tyrosylquinone, which can readily oxidize primary amines into aldehydes via a quinone-mediated transamination pathway using O 2 as a co-oxidant to complete the catalytic cycle ( Fig. 1a) 3, 4 . Recently, significant progress has been achieved toward the design of quinone-based catalysts with major contributions from Corey 5 , Fleury 6 , Kobayashi 7 , Stahl [8] [9] [10] and Luo (Fig. 1b) [11] [12] [13] . These biomimetic quinone-based catalysts show specific chemoselectivity toward the dehydrogenation of primary, secondary, tertiary amines or other reactions [14] [15] [16] . The applications of quinone oxidation have been largely limited to small molecule transformations despite the significant research progress in this area 17, 18 . On the other side, in nature, the reactions between oquinones such as DOPA 19 and protein side chains are important but complex in fundamental process of life 20 . Although the early work provided by Mason in 1955 showed that o-quinones could react with proteins via the N-terminal residue 21 , the reaction between o-quinone motifs and proteins have not been fully elucidated on a molecular level 22 . Nevertheless, the intrinsic design of quinones by nature may provide an effective opportunity to modify proteins under physiological conditions.",

In this context, selective modification of the N-terminus of proteins has led to the single site functionalization of proteins [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Although significant progress has been made, the majority of these methods required specific N-terminal residue, owing to their assistance of the side-chain functionality, such as \u03b2-nucleophilically-functionalized Cys [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , Ser/Thr 36, 37 . Transamination reactions under physiological conditions have been elegantly developed by Francis and co-workers utilizing pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] or N-methylpyridinium-4carboxaldehyde benzenesulfonate salt (Rapoport's salt) 46 as oxidants, which can convert the N-termini of proteins into aldo or keto functionalities for oxime formation or other bioconjugation reactions [47] [48] [49] . However, the rate or efficiency of transamination/oxime formation may vary at different N-termini or even different amino acid combinations 50, 51 . Room for improvements is still remained in the field of N-terminal modification strategy 52 . Marginally, the salt nature of NaIO 4 , PLP or RS salt makes them difficult to be removed from aqueous medium after transamination of peptide or small protein targets, which may potentially interfere the subsequent conjugations 53 . Thus, given the generality of quinone and its derivatives in the effective oxidation of amines, we seek to investigate whether or not the quinones may be suitable reagents for the selective and efficient oxidation of the N-terminal \u03b1-amines of proteins to aldehyde or ketone with fast kinetics as well as a wide scope of amino acids.",

To begin our journey, a range of quinone derivatives Ox1-Ox8 were prepared containing different functionalities with an aim toward fine-tuning their reactivity to be selective for the \u03b1-amine rather than the \u03b5-amine of Lys, as well as other functionalities 7, 11, 12 . We tested the transamination reaction of model peptide 1 (1 mM) with the sequence of GFHAKGY in an aqueous solution buffered at pH 6.5 using 10 mM (saturated) of the quinones (Ox1-Ox8) as the oxidants (Fig. 2a) . The oxidized product was subsequently reacted with EtONH 2 to form its corresponding oxime 1a. 4-tert- Butyl-5-methoxy-4-tert-butyl-o-benzylquinone Ox1 achieved near quantitative conversion (>90%) to generate product 1a in 3 h with <2% Lys oxidation observed via LCMS due to the extraordinary low pKa of the N-terminal amine compared to that of the Lys side chain amine 26 . 4-tert-Butyl-o-benzylquinone Ox2 could also achieve 55% conversion at pH 6.5; the major byproduct 1b was attributed to the undesired Lys side chain oxidation (>40%) (Fig. 2b ). Further optimization of the pH of the transamination reactions with either quinone Ox1 or Ox2 showed that Ox1 had an optimal pH range of 6.0-6.5, while the side reaction during using quinone Ox2 could be minimized by lowering reaction pH to 4.0 (90% conversion to give target product 1a) (Fig. 2c) . Although tetrachloro-o-quinone Ox3 resulted in 65% conversion to desired oxime 1a, the reaction also led to other side reactions which complexed the system. Other quinone derivatives were also evaluated, but no promising results were given. Thus, Ox1 serves as the most effective oxidant (see Supplementary Note 8 for the discussion of the mechanism). A timecourse monitoring study was performed to verify that the reaction reached to completion in 3 h at room temperature (see Supplementary Note 3.2.3.). Although an early work demonstrated that the Cu 2+ salt was necessary for N-terminal oxidation with glyoxylate as reagent 55 , addition of Cu 2+ in this reaction did not increase the yield of the oxidative product. Interestingly, compared with such reactions with small molecules (Fig. 1b) where an imine was formed between starting amine and ketone, quinonemediated transamination can readily push towards completion (90% conversion) without formation of such imine derivative which may potentially quench the reaction.",

Asp peptide 7 underwent oxidative decarboxylation during the oxidation and therefore formed the methylated product 11a.

Peptides 11\u221215 (containing Ala, Phe, Ile, Tyr and Val as N-termini, respectively) could also be converted into their desired oxime products, but with lower conversions. Asn peptide 16 was oxidized in the first step, but the resulting ketone product could not be converted to oxime effectively in 3 h. Further extension of oxime reaction time to 5 h led to the formation of product 16a with 88% conversion.

            "text": "Transamination of proteins with different N-termini. After screening the scope of N-terminal residues in the reaction, we further applied this method to more complex therapeutic peptides and proteins. The first target chosen was COVID-19 spike protein 319-347 fragment, which is located in its receptor binding domain. The peptide contains an Arg residue at its N-terminus and a cysteine residue, which is protected with acetamidomethyl (Acm) group. Due to the low solubility of this peptide, the transamination step was carried out in 2 M Gn\u00b7HCl buffer for 6 h with all the other reaction conditions unchanged. The reaction proceeded smoothly to afford the oxime product 21 with 85% conversion (Fig. 4a) . Tetracosactide, a therapeutic peptide bearing an N-terminal Ser, one Met and four Lys residues in its sequence, was successfully oxidized under the standard reaction conditions in 3 h. The desired oxime product 22 was formed with 80% conversion monitored by LCMS (Fig. 4b) . The scope of this transformation was next examined using myoglobin, which contains 18 Lys residues in the sequence (Fig. 4c) . This reaction was conducted in aqueous buffer at pH 6.0 to minimize overoxidation of the Lys side chain and the reaction time was extended to 5 h. Due to the limitation of the chromatographic techniques used, total ion counts (TICs) were used to determine the conversion rate after a simple workup procedure (see Supplementary Note 3.6.2). The desired ethyl oxime product 23a was observed with 70% conversion, 15% unreacted starting material and 15% of the over-oxidized by-product. Furthermore, a biotinylated tag was synthesized and incorporated to myoglobin. However, due to the low reactivity of this tag, an excess of Ox1 could not be quenched immediately, which then led to further oxidation during the oxime formation step. To address this issue, once the first transamination reaction was completed, an ether extraction step was carried out to remove the excess oxidant. The resulting solution underwent the oxime formation step overnight to afford a 40% conversion of biotinylated protein 23b. In nature, many proteins are expressed with Met as their N-terminus. Therefore, we examined this transformation with ubiquitin, which contains an N-terminal Met. In 2 M Gn\u00b7HCl buffer, ubiquitin was smoothly converted into its oxime product 24 with 77% conversion (Fig. 4d) . Although disulfide bonds within peptides and proteins could stay untouched in our reaction, free Cys residue remained challenged as it could form an adduct with Ox1. Therefore, we designed a temporary protecting strategy for free Cys containing proteins. We tested the compatibility of this strategy with RNF-4 fragment (32-133, N-terminal Glu) and A1G-SUMO2 protein (with mutation of N-terminal Ala to Gly) as examples (Fig. 5) . Initially, three Cys residues in RNF4 and one in SUMO2 were protected with 2-nitropiperonyl bromide under pH 6.5 for 2 h 57 , leading to protected RNF4 25 and SUMO2 26. Next, both proteins underwent transamination with Ox1, followed by subsequent oxime formation with EtONH 2 (0.1 mM) to form the desired oxime products. After the Ox1 mediated oxidation, the protecting groups were removed tracelessly within 30 min in the presence of 20 nM sodium ascorbate and UV (\u03bb = 365 nm) irradiation, affording N-terminal modified RNF4 32-133 fragment 27 and SUMO2 28 with 75% and 80% conversion over three steps, respectively. Circular dichroism spectra of N-terminal modified protein 28 was compared with that of the expressed SUMO2 protein to confirm that its tertiary structure remained unchanged during reactions (see Supplementary Note 3.9.2).",

Diversification of the N-terminal region of CCLs can be greatly beneficial toward the development of future peptide HIV-1 inhibitors 62-64 . However, current methods rarely facilitate such direct modifications of its N-termini 65 . Thus, a merging of late-stage oxidation and state-of-the-art peptide ligation method will allow the fast generation of a protein library for the rapid screening of potential drugs. We synthesized a truncated MIP-1\u03b2 4-96 protein 29, which contained Gly4 and the fulllength form of MIP-1\u03b2 30 with the mutation of Ala1 to Gly for oxidation (Fig. 6b) . Both proteins were chemically synthesized via native chemical ligation 66, 67 and refolded using cysteine/cystine redox 68 Having established a facile protocol to prepare MIP-1\u03b2 proteins on a large-scale, we next performed the protein Nterminal transamination-oxime ligation reaction to modify the (Fig. 6a) . Hexyl, (E)-hexyl, (Z)-hexyl, geranyl and decyl hydroxylamine were used to investigate the influence of the hydrocarbon chains with different conformation or chain lengths toward fine-tuning the bioactivity (Fig. 6c) . In addition, we also synthesized PEGylated hydroxylamine as a hydrophilic tag for comparison. Ox1 was added into the target protein 29 or 30 in buffer solution at pH 6.5 and the solution was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 3 h. Subsequently, after the addition of the alkoxyamine, the mixture was readjusted to pH 6.5 and reacted for a further 16 h to afford modified proteins 31-45 (Fig. 6c) . MIP-1\u03b2 proteins and MeONH 2 \u00b7HCl or EtONH 2 \u00b7HCl were dissolved well in this buffer solution, and the ligations proceeded smoothly and gave high isolated yields (43% for 31, 44% for 38 and 47% for 39, respectively). Reactions with fatty alkoxyamines became biphasic due to their poor solubility, vigorous stirring was necessary during these reactions. After 24 h of reaction, a small amount of starting material was still present (~20% by HPLC analysis), which suggested that these lipo-hydroxylamines did not mix well even in an aqueous buffer and hence resulted in a decreased yield (28-38%). PEGylated variants (37 and 45) were obtained with low yielding (23% and 25%, respectively) due to incomplete formation of oxime. Transamination with Ox1 was fully compatible with the disulfide bonds in these proteins without disrupting their biological activity, as shown by HPLC-MS and the anti-HIV-1 assay.",

Recombinant human MIP-1\u03b2 (Rh-CCL4) was used as the primary standard with a measured half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) value of 3.3 \u03bcM (Fig. 6d) . Protein 29 (4-69) resulted in a complete loss of anti-HIV-1 activity within the concentration range studied (up to 5 \u03bcM). Interestingly, ethylated variant 31 regained its activity with an EC 50 value of 200 nM. Full-length Gly1-69 protein 30 also displayed increased inhibitory activity with an EC 50 value of 157 nM upon substitution of Ala1 with Gly, which suggested that a branched methyl group decreases the binding affinity between MIP-1\u03b2 and CCR5. Further extension of full-length protein 30 with methoxyamine and ethoxyamine showed comparable activities against HIV-1 by an order of magnitude (38: EC 50 = 2.7 \u03bcM and 39: EC 50 = 2.3 \u03bcM), whereas all the lipo-variants and PEGylated variants exhibited no activity within the concentration range studied (all EC 50 > 5 \u03bcM, see SI). Besides, a cell viability assay with MTT was also performed to explore the cytotoxicity of the synthetic proteins toward TZM-bl cells. In our investigations, all the synthetic proteins exhibited cytotoxicity with 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) values of > 50 \u03bcM (see Supplementary Note 7), which indicated that the proteins showed no cytotoxic behavior. In our future studies, we will further optimize the N-terminal domain with hydroxyamines bearing other functionalities and thereafter explain the exact mechanism of how these modified proteins exhibit their inhibitory activity against HIV-1 both in vitro and in vivo.",

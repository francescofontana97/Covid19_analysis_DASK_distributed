Both viruses can cause significant morbidity and mortality in a variety of vertebrate species including humans [2] . Pteropid bats (family Pteropodidae), commonly known as flying foxes, are the predominant natural reservoirs for both HeV and NiV [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , although evidence of henipavirus infection has now been reported in a wider range of both frugivorous and insectivorous bats (reviewed in [8] ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 167, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 281, "end": 284, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 416, "end": 419, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 420, "end": 423, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 424, "end": 427, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 428, "end": 431, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 432, "end": 435, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 576, "end": 579, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Hendra virus spillovers, predominantly into horses, have occurred in Australia 61 times since the first occurrence in 1994, resulting in the death or euthanasia of more than 100 horses across 39 different locales in Queensland and New South Wales, including the euthanasia of 2 HeV-seropositive dogs [9] . These occurrences of HeV also resulted in 7 known human infections with 4 case fatalities all resulting from contact with sick horses, and 13 cases of significant risk of HeV infection resulting in the compassionate emergency use of a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) known as m102.4 as a postexposure therapy in people (reviewed in [10] ) (E. G. Playford, unpublished data, 2019). Since the emergence of the Malaysian strain of NiV (NiV-MY) in 1998 [11] and followed by the recognition of NiV infections in Bangladesh and India by a Bangladesh strain of NiV (NiV-BD) [12, 13] and NiV-MY in the Philippines [14] , NiV has repeatedly caused spillover events involving hundreds of human cases, with significant amounts of human-to-human transmission and high case fatality rates (40%-100%). Nipah virus was recently classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an epidemic threat needing urgent research and development action and is included in the WHO R&D Blueprint list of priority pathogens with epidemic potential [15] . In addition, NiV and HeV also have a remarkably broad host tropism and are a significant transboundary threat capable of causing an often fatal widespread systemic disease in horses, pigs, cats, dogs, ferrets, hamsters, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates, spanning 6 mammalian orders [2, 16, 17] . Infection of host cells by NiV and HeV requires 2 membraneanchored envelope glycoproteins; the attachment (G) glycoprotein, which recognizes the ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3 entry receptor, and the fusion (F) glycoprotein, which drives virushost cell membrane merger [18] [19] [20] . Both glycoproteins are the major targets of the host neutralizing antibody response [21] . In a previous study, we developed a cross-reactive, neutralizing, human mAb (m102.4) that recognizes and blocks the ephrin entry receptor binding site on the G glycoprotein [22] [23] [24] . m102.4 can potently neutralize HeV and NiV-M and NiV-BD in vitro, and when delivered as a therapeutic modality it has been shown to protect ferrets and nonhuman primates (African green monkeys [AGMs]) from lethal disease even when administered up to several days postinfection [25] [26] [27] [28] . It has also been shown that immunization of mice with recombinant trimeric prefusion NiV or HeV F glycoprotein ectodomains could induce strong serum neutralization titers, whereas trimeric postfusion F ectodomains failed to elicit robust neutralizing responses [29] . We isolated a mouse mAb that specifically recognizes the prefusion NiV and HeV F glycoprotein trimers, designated 5B3 [29, 30] , and recently we reported the cloning, sequencing, and humanization of 5B3 (h5B3.1) along with the cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of the NiV F trimer in complex with 5B3 Fab. The structural analysis revealed the interaction of 5B3 with a prefusion-specific quaternary epitope conserved in F, and it demonstrated that it locks F in the prefusion conformation preventing its membrane fusion activity, providing a molecular mechanism of its virus (NiV-M, NiV-B, and HeV) neutralizing potency [31] . In this study, we examine the protective efficacy of a humanized version of 5B3 (h5B3.1) and report that it can effectively prevent lethal NiV and HeV disease in ferrets when administered as a postinfection therapeutic modality, providing further evidence that mAb-based therapeutics for the treatments of NiV-and HeV-infected individuals may be possible.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 300, "end": 303, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 638, "end": 642, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 755, "end": 759, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 873, "end": 877, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 878, "end": 881, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 912, "end": 916, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1334, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1624, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1628, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1632, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1896, "end": 1900, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1901, "end": 1905, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1906, "end": 1910, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1997, "end": 2001, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2177, "end": 2181, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2182, "end": 2186, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2191, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2471, "end": 2475, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2476, "end": 2480, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2481, "end": 2485, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2486, "end": 2490, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2754, "end": 2758, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2879, "end": 2883, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2884, "end": 2887, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3391, "end": 3395, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Nipah virus number 1999011924 (GenBank NC_002728) was obtained from a patient from the 1999 outbreak in Malaysia (kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Ksiazek, University of Texas Medical Branch).

Earlier, we isolated and characterized a number of mouse mAbs specific to F [29] , and 1 mAb (5B3) possessed strong NiV/HeV neutralizing activity and specifically recognized the prefusion conformation of the F glycoprotein trimer [29, 30] .

Furthermore, anti-F mouse polyclonal antibodies and mAbs were shown to protect hamsters from NiV and HeV challenge [41, 42] , and in this study we examined a well characterized, cross-reactive (NiV-M, NiV-B and HeV), neutralizing humanized mAb (h5B3.1), with the potential for human use, that targets the F glycoprotein as a postinfection therapeutic. The paramyxovirus F glycoprotein, and its prefusion to postfusion conformational transition, is the driver of virion and host membrane merger initiating virus infection (reviewed in [43] ). The 5B3 mAb and its humanized derivative, h5B3.1, target a conserved epitope in the prefusion conformation of the NiV/HeV F glycoprotein [29] [30] [31] . The mechanism underlying 5B3 and h5B3.1 NiV/HeV neutralization is its ability to lock F in the prefusion conformation preventing its membrane fusion activity. In this study, we explored whether h5B3.1 could also be effective in vivo in preventing lethal NiV and HeV disease in a well characterized animal model. Using the ferret model, we challenged subjects with NiV or HeV, and then we administered h5B3.1 mAb up to several days after virus administration. All subjects that received h5B3.1 survived NiV and HeV infection; however, in contrast, our controls in the 100% lethal models succumbed. The survival of all subjects in both the NiV and HeV postchallenge groups in the present study represents an additional and major step forward towards a viable passive immunotherapeutic approach to counter NiV and HeV infection. Furthermore, the protective efficacy of h5B3.1 in preventing lethal NiV and HeV disease shown here, when administered as a postinfection therapeutic modality, provides further evidence that mAb-based therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of NiV-and HeV-infected individuals may be possible, and based on prior studies in both ferrets and nonhuman primates using another anti-NiV/HeV human mAb, therapeutic treatment will likely also reduce the possibility of infectious virus shedding [25] [26] [27] [28] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 331, "end": 335, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 336, "end": 340, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 341, "end": 345, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 346, "end": 350, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 468, "end": 472, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 473, "end": 476, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 887, "end": 891, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1036, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1041, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1046, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2368, "end": 2372, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2373, "end": 2377, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2378, "end": 2382, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2387, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "However, the isolation of mAb neutralization escape mutants of HeV and NiV is also possible and has been demonstrated by passaging in presence of m102.4 [22] and h5B3.1 [31] , but virus escape has never been observed during m102.4 or h5B3.1 in vivo efficacy testing presumably due to the very high doses of mAb used in conjunction with an effective adaptive immune responses in virus-challenged subjects.

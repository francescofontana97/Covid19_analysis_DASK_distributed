F\u00f6llmer and Leukert (2000) and Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2014) proposed to use general expected penalties that only penalise losses. F\u00f6llmer and Leukert (1999) defined the quantile hedging scheme, which maximises the probability that the hedging loss does not exceed a certain threshold at maturity, given an initial capital. In this paper, by quantile hedging, we mean hedging with a quantile regressor as considered in Koenker and Bassett Jr (1978) which is a related but different objective compared to the quantile hedging of F\u00f6llmer and Leukert (1999) .",

In a first step, a portfolio of traded assets aimed at replicating the liability as close as possible (in the quadratic sense) is determined similar to F\u00f6llmer and Schweizer (1988) . Such portfolio replicates the liability on average. In a second step, the residual liability is managed by generalised error functions, which are associated with setting different statistics of residual loss (e.g. VaR or Expectile) to zero. In particular, our focus is on local quantile hedging using the asymmetric Koenker-Basset error (cf. Koenker and Bassett Jr, 1978) given the use of VaR in regulation. Interestingly, the resulting hedging portfolio appears as a Tail Value-at-Risk deviation risk minimiser among all portfolios which satisfy VaR constraints (Rockafellar et al., 2008) . Hence, one can achieve a better risk management by quantile-hedging the residual risk rather than setting up a VaR capital buffer (cf. Lemma 2.7).",

Figure 7 represents the number of assets held at time t = 5 as a function of the stock price at time 5. As expected, we notice that the investment in the stock is an increasing function of the stock price to better match the terminal liability. On the other hand, due to a compensating effect, the risk-free investment is a decreasing function of the stock price and reaches zero for high stock prices.",

An appropriate quantile hedging algorithm should therefore have residuals with a VaR close to zero and the average Koenker-Bassett error close to the TVaR deviation. Table 2 reports the VaR of the residuals, the average Koenker-Bassett error and the TVaR deviation for all t. We observe that the empirical VaR is indeed close to zero and small compared to the expected payoff E [S] \u2248 1162. Moreover, the K-B error is close to the TVaR deviation, hence showing the accuracy of our algorithm. The remaining difference is essentially due to the estimation and simulation error of our approach, which can be further reduced by increasing the simulations or the complexity of the neural network at the cost of a more expensive computational time.

For the first part, it seems that the quadratic objective has become a standard practice probably due to its analytical tractability and the fact that the resulting hedging portfolio targets the expected liability (Pelsser and Schweizer, 2016) . However, there is still an open debate on how to appropriately treat the residual part and define an appropriate \"risk margin\" (see e.g. Pelkiewicz et al., 2020 for a review on the Solvency II risk margin). In the literature, different approaches were considered to value the residual risk, either by an Esscher valuation operator (Deelstra et al., 2020) , a standard-deviation principle , Ghalehjooghi and Pelsser, 2020 , Chen et al., 2020 , Delong et al., 2019 , or a cost-of-capital principle (Pelsser, 2011) .",

Rather than using a cost-of-capital principle on the residual risk, we propose to quantile-hedge it. While both approaches lead to a VaR-neutral portfolio, our proposed approach has two noticeable advantages. First, the quantile hedging portfolio is a TVaR deviation risk minimiser and therefore better accounts for the tail risk (see Lemma 2.7, Examples 1, 2). Second, our quadratic-quantile approach shows that the residual risk can still be partially hedged if one switches from a quadratic to a quantile hedging objective. This is especially relevant when there is a non-linear relationship between the insurance liability and traded instruments.",

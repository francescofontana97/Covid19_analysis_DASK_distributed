            "text": "COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 11 by WHO, due to its great threat to global public health. The coronavirus main protease (M pro , also called 3CLpro) is essential for processing and maturation of the viral polyprotein, therefore recognized as an attractive drug target. Here we show that a clinically approved anti-HCV drug, Boceprevir, and a pre-clinical inhibitor against feline infectious peritonitis (corona) virus (FIPV), GC376, both efficaciously inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells by targeting M pro . Moreover, combined application of GC376 with Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue that inhibits viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), results in sterilizing additive effect. Further structural analysis reveals binding of both inhibitors to the catalytically active side of SARS-CoV-2 protease M pro as main mechanism of inhibition. Our findings may provide critical information for the optimization and design of more potent inhibitors against the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

As there is neither specific antiviral agents nor available vaccines, repurposing of clinically approved drugs to combat the COVID-19 is urgently needed. Here we show both Boceprevir and GC376 can inhibit M pro activity and SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells. Moreover, combination of GC376 with Remdesivir treatment can enhance antiviral activity. Additionally, the highresolution crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M pro complex with these two inhibitors are solved to figure out their mechanism of inhibition.

Then, we screened these chemical drugs by in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) enzymatic assays at a single concentration (100 \u03bcM; Fig. 1a , b). We identified two inhibitors, Boceprevir and GC376, can inhibit the enzymatic activity well (Fig. 1b) . In contrast, other drugs such as Aluvia \u00ae (HIV protease inhibitors, lopinavir, and ritonavir) did not show detectable inhibitory activity, which is consistent with the reports of recent clinical trials that Aluvia \u00ae has no obvious effect on the treatment of COVID-19 24 .",

Before further evaluating protein level inhibitory activity of Boceprevir and GC376, we found that extra residues at the N-terminus would impair the enzyme activity in previous report 25 . Therefore, we expressed the native M pro without any extra amino acids at the N-terminus (a gift from Dr Haitao Yang in ShaghaiTech University) according to the literature 26 . Then, we compared GM pro activity with the native M pro . Substrate hydrolysis rate of the native M pro (frist 1000 s initial speed v 0 = 1618 \u00b1 84 RFU s \u22121 ) is almost three times faster than that of GM pro (first 1000 s initial speed v 0 = 449 \u00b1 19 RFU s \u22121 ), which must be caused by extra Gly at the N terminus ( Supplementary Fig. 2a) . Again, our data readdress the importance of the free N-terminus after previous report of 2 or 5 extra amino acids, showing 20-fold or 150-fold slower catalytic efficiency 25 . In order to figure out how the glycine at the N-terminus affects protease activity, we crystallized the GM pro protein and solved the crystal structure at a resolution of 2.0 \u00c5. The overall structure of GM pro is highly similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 native M pro and SARS-CoV native M pro (Supplementary Fig. 3a ). The first residue Ser is disordered in GM pro structure, indicating this residue cannot stabilize Glu166 of the S1 subsite in the neighboring protomer, which may be the main reason for the decrease of enzyme activity ( Supplementary  Fig. 3a) . However, the extra glycine did not induce the main chain of residues 141-142 moves towards the S1 subsite as seen in previous report with five extra amino acids 25 ( Supplementary  Fig. 3b ).",

It was reported that the ketoamide group of Boceprevir can reversibly bind covalently to the Ser139 of HCV NS3/4A protease, whose hydroxyl group function as nucleophilic groups in enzymatic reaction 27 . Boceprevir was shown to be a time-dependent inhibitor with a fast-initial binding followed by a slow formation of the covalent adduct against NS3/ 4A protease 28 . GC376 is a cysteine protease covalent inhibitor against picornaviruses, noroviruses, and coronaviruses, and has shown promise in treating cats with fatal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) caused by FIPV 29, 30 . For time-dependent inhibitors, we tried to evaluate the equilibrium-binding constant K i and the inactivation rate constant k inac for covalent bond formation of Boceprevir and GC376 without preincubation. Progress curve of peptide hydrolysis by M pro showed the inactivation processes of both two inhibitors are very slow ( Supplementary Fig. 2b, c) . So we used the IC 50 values of these two inhibitors, 8.0 \u03bcM and 0.15 \u03bcM, to represent the inhibitory activity (Fig. 1d, f) , which has also been used in other covalent inhibitor studys 31, 32 . Meanwhile, we have performed the inhibition assay to test if these two compounds inhibit bovine chymotrypsin at the concentrations of 20 and 50 \u03bcM ( Supplementary Fig. 2d) . The results showed that GC376 does not have any inhibition activity against the bovine chymotrypsin, while Boceprevir shows very trivial inhibition activity, indicating the M pro inhibitory activity of these two compounds are specific. Fig. 4 ). In order to further validate the antiviral effect of these inhibitors, we performed the traditional plaque assay stained with crystal violet. The plaque produced by the SARS-CoV-2 does not look like circles, which caused that it is difficult to quantify the antiviral efficacy for GC376 and Boceprevir. The possible reason is that the virus has been incubated with cells for a long time and multiple plaques are connected together. However, in presence of 40 \u03bcM Boceprevir or 1.6 \u03bcM GC376, the size and number of plaques are obviously smaller and less ( Supplementary Fig. 5a , b). In addition, combination of 1 \u03bcM GC376 and 1 \u03bcM Remdesivir can completely inhibit viral replication in virus plaque assay ( Supplementary Fig. 5d) , showing additive effect of the joint application of RdRp inhibitors and protease inhibitors targeting different viral proteins.",

In order to elucidate the inhibitory mechanisms of these two compounds, we determined the crystal structures of M pro -Boceprevir and M pro -GC376 complexes at resolutions of 1.60 \u00c5 and 2.00 \u00c5, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 1 ). The unambiguous electron density maps show that the two inhibitors bind in the active site of M pro in different conformations ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ). In the M pro -Boceprevir complex structure, the S\u03b3 atom of the nucleophilic Cys145 in M pro forms a C-S covalent bond with the keto carbon of Boceprevir, which is a typical Michael addition (Fig. 3a , b and Supplementary Fig. 8a ). Residues His41, Gly143, and His164 form four hydrogen-bonding interactions with the amide backbone of Boceprevir in one side, and residue Glu166 form three hydrogenbonding interactions with Boceprevir in the other side. The small size of cyclobutylalanice (c-Bua) residue can be tolerated by S1 subsite. However, the P1 c-Bua residue has no interaction with S1 subsite (Fig. 3b) . The hydrophilic Glu166 pushes the P1 hydrophobic group away and exposes the c-Bua residue to solvent. This can explain why Boceprevir displays a moderate activity against M pro . The rigid P2 dimethylcyclopropylproline (DMCP) residue can fit S2 subsite well (Fig. 3a) and has hydrophobic interaction with Met149 and Asp187 ( Supplementary  Fig. 8a ). The hydrophobic P3 and P4 tert-butyl (tBu) residue can interact with Met165 in S3 subsite and Gln189, Gln192, Thr190 in S4 subsite ( Supplementary Fig. 8a ). Compared with HCV NS3/ 4A-Boceprevir complex 27 , the binding pocket are quite different due to low structural similarity, and the compound has large conformational changes to fit the HCV NS3/4A binding pocket (Fig. 3c) . In all, 80% P1 c-Bua residue of Boceprevir is buried in S1 subsite which contributes the largest factor to binding. By contrast, in the SARS-CoV-2 M pro -Boceprevir complex structure, the P2 DMCP residue and P4 tBu cap are 80% buried other than P1 c-Bua residue. About 40% of P2, P3, and P4 residues are buried in S2, S3, and S4 subsite of HCV NS3/4A protease, which are highly exposed to solvent (Fig. 3c) 27 .",

The glutamine surrogate ring of GC376 fits into the S1 pocket and has hydrogen bonding interactions with the carboxyl group of Glu166. The Leu of GC376 fits into S2 hydrophobic pocket, which is consists of residues Arg40, His41, Met49, Tyr54, and Asp187. Compared with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) M pro -GC376 complex, both the binding pocket and the configuration of GC376 are highly similar, suggesting a conserved interaction mode for GC376 against different coronaviruses (Fig. 3f) . The crystal structures of GM pro -Boceprevir and GM pro -GC376 complexes at resolutions of 1.80 \u00c5 and 1.40 \u00c5 was also determined to evaluate the influences of the extra glycine at N terminal. Compared to M pro -Boceprevir, only P4 residue of Boceprevir has slight changes in GM pro -Boceprevir complex (Supplementary Fig. 3c) . The binding mode of GC376 with GM pro or M pro has no obvious changes ( Supplementary Fig. 3d ).",

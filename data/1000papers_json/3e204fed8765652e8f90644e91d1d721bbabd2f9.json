Among these, mutual information-based methods, i.e., ARACNE, CLR, and MRNET, reconstruct networks using a steady-state data set. Therefore, we used a time-shift technique (as discussed in [1] ) on the DREAM4 time series data to generate the time-lagged time series data and then obtained results.",

Thus, to evaluate its performance on discretized data, a little amount of white Gaussian noise is added to the discretized data to make it continuous, and then the experiment is performed. The procedure for the addition of noise is as follows: The noise N (0, s) with mean \u00b5 = 0 and standard deviation s is added to the discretized data set D of size m \u00d7 n. We have computed the standard deviation s as:",

            "text": "The G1DBN method is a two-step approach that uses an auto-regressive model to estimate a score matrix of size p \u00d7 p using a time series data of p genes. The Step 1 infers a score matrix that describes first-order dependencies of gene pairs. A threshold \u03b11 is applied on the score matrix to select the gene pairs such that the density of target gene having 0 or 1 regulator genes is much larger than that of target genes with 2 or more regulators. On the score matrix of the selected gene pairs, Step 2 is applied, which generates a score matrix describing full-order dependencies of selected genes. Applying another threshold \u03b12 on the second score matrix returns the final set of edges. The threshold \u03b12 is chosen using the Benjamini-Hochberg approach [2] to select the significant edges such that they contain False Discovery Rate (FDR) \u2264 0.01. Thus, threshold \u03b11 helps in dimensionality reduction and is based on the assumption that in gene networks, most of the target genes contain only a few TFs. Threshold \u03b12 is then used to select the final set of significant edges. For the application of the G1DBN method on the DREAM4 data, threshold \u03b11 = 1 is used since the DREAM4 data sets contain a small number of genes (10 and 100), and thus no dimensionality reduction is required. Therefore all the edges except self-edges are considered here.",

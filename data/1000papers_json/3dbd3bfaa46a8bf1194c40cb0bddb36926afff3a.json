Acari is one of the most abundant clades of Arachnida, exhibiting diverse dietary types, while the underlying genetic adaptive mechanisms are not fully understood. Based on comparative analyses of 15 Acari genomes, we found genetic bases for three specialized diets. Herbivores experienced stronger selection pressure than other groups; the olfactory genes and gene families involving metabolizing toxins showed strong adaptive signals. Genes and gene families related to anticoagulation, detoxification, and haemoglobin digestion were found to be under strong selection pressure or significantly expanded in the blood-feeding species. Lipid metabolism genes have a faster evolutionary rate and been subjected to greater selection pressures in fatfeeding species; one positively selected site in the fatty-acid amide hydrolases 2 gene was identified. Our research provides a new perspective for the evolution of Acari and offers potential target loci for novel pesticide development.",

Approximately 55,000 species have been described 10 , and the total species number is estimated to be much larger 9, 10 . It was reported that the diverse lifestyles in Acari (e.g., free-living, symbiotic, and parasitic) serve as an important driver of its species diversity 11 . The dietary lifestyles of Acari range from predatory to parasitic 9 . Compared with spiders with a predatory diet, Acari exhibit several new diets, such as herbivory and parasitism (e.g., blood and fat bodies), as well as some transitional states such as the consumption of skin exudates, decomposing biomass, and fungi 9, 12 . These different specialized diets have generated a number of physiological, biochemical, and morphological adaptations 4 . For example, herbivorous mites have developed a long and stout stylet-like structure for feeding on plant juice 13, 14 . A key mechanism of phenotypic adaptation is genetic adaptation, including changes in functional genes, metabolic and regulatory pathways, and even amino acids 5, 6, 15 . However, the genetic mechanisms underlying the dietary adaptation of Acari have not yet been systematically discussed in a comparative manner.",

A total of 65, 23, 54 and 27, and 29 pseudogenes were detected to be common in the groups fed the five diets, predation, blood, plant, fat, and others (transitional type), respectively (Fig. 2a , Supplementary Data 2). Among these pseudogenes, the genes for ribonuclease H were pseudogenized in both the blood-sucking group and fat-feeding group (Supplementary Data 2), which may be related to their parasitic lifestyles. Interestingly, no pseudogenes were shared across all dietary groups, implying that different patterns occurred during the dietary shift (Supplementary Data 2). Since the pseudogenes are nonfunctional, subsequent analyses based on functional genes were carried out after removing the pseudogenes.",

As a result, 530 positively selected genes (PSGs) were identified, and 291, 56, 73, and 110 PSGs were detected for the plant, predation, blood, and fat diets, respectively (Supplementary Data 2). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that the PSGs were partly correlated with the ability to digest different food types, such as Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism in the plant dietary group and Arachidonic acid metabolism in the fat dietary group (Fig. 2c , Supplementary Data 2). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis also revealed biological processes correlated with different diets, such as organonitrogen metabolism in the herbivorous group (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 2). To compare the overall pressure of natural selection on different food preferences, a total of 439 PSGs in four dietary groups (at least two species for each group) were selected to conduct cross-sectional analysis (Supplementary Data 2). Herbivorous mites were subjected to the strongest natural selection, containing 265 of the 439 PSGs (Fig. 2d ). The number of PSGs under intense selection (PSGs with more than 20 positively selected sites) was much larger in the blood-sucking group than in the other groups (Fig. 2d) , suggesting that blood-sucking mites were subjected to stronger selection pressure on specific genes during dietary shifts. Some of these intensely selected genes are related to blood digestion, such as carboxylesterase and serine/threonine-protein phosphatase (Supplementary Data 2).",

The serpin family directly inhibits blood coagulation factor XIa or enhances the inhibition of blood coagulation factor Xa via Protein Z 48 , which is highly relevant to the blood-sucking process.

The expanded CPVL gene family is regarded as a member of the serine carboxypeptidases, which are characterized as the main enzymes acting in blood digestion [51] [52] [53] [54] . Among the PSGs, PAQR5 (OG0000879, P = 0.02) and CaMKII (OG0000260, P = 0.05), which are involved in blood pressure management, digestion, and absorption of vascular contents [55] [56] [57] , were found to be under strong positive selection (Supplementary Data 2). There was one gene, Carboxylesterase (CES2), with more than 200 sites under positive selection (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Data 2) . CES2 is recognized as a highly conserved metabolic pathway involved in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds, which is the key to detoxification during blood feeding 58, 59 . The high number of nucleotide sites under selection in CES2 probably modifies the activity of the coded enzyme, significantly increasing the detoxification abilities in these blood-feeding Acari 60 . Adaption to fat-feeding. Another major dietary shift in Acari occurs in honeybee mites, which have attracted attention due to their damage to the beekeeping industry worldwide 21 . The identification of the genetic basis underlying fat-feeding habits could contribute to more effective measures for pest prevention, such as the development of new insecticides. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the 110 PSGs found on the honeybee mite branch were significantly enriched in the Arachidonic acid metabolism pathway (dme00590, P = 0.036) (Fig. 6a , Supplementary Data 2). One positively selected site, W516F/Y, in the fatty-acid amide hydrolases 2 (FAAH2) gene was TTT(F) or TAT (Y) in fat-eating honeybee mites, different from the TGG(W) in other mites (Fig. 6b) . The amino acid substitution in FAAH2 occurs in the amidase signature (AS) domain region (Fig. 6b) and may lead to a change in hydrolase activity to influence the ability of FAAH2 to generate free arachidonate acid (AA) from anandamide. AA is indispensable for the development of the nervous and immune systems, and anandamide is one kind of enriched lipid in honey bees 61 . Compared with the absence of FAAH2 in some mammals such as rats and low-fat-diet mice 62 , the change in W516F/Y may enhance the generation of AA from an anandamide-enriched diet. Further experimental validation is needed to confirm this relationship.",

The repetitive elements in the genome sequence were identified by RepeatMasker 63 (version 4.0.7) with Repbase (version 16.02).

Single-copy orthologous genes were generated from the OrthoFinder result, and conserved blocks of each gene were extracted by Gblocks (version 0.91b). Then, we combined all the conserved regions of every orthologous gene. A total of 50,502 sites were concatenated to build one supergene sequence for each species, which was adopted to construct the phylogenetic tree. The supergene phylogeny was constructed with RAxML 65 (version 8.2.12) under the GTRGAMMA model. A total of 200 bootstrap replicates were conducted, and the tree with the highest likelihood score was picked as a standard tree. Based on the topology of the standard tree, the branch length of each gene was estimated with its sequence. Then, genes with extremely biased branch lengths were excluded. After removing all biased genes, the species tree was reconstructed based on 48,831 conserved sites by RAxML with 1,000 bootstrap replicates following the command raxmlHPC-PTHREADS-SSE3 -x 12345 -p 12345 -# 1000 -m GTRGAMMA. Gene family analysis. The protein sequences of sixteen Arachnida genomes were generated from the annotated results. We removed the proteins with prematurestop codons or a length less than 50 amino acids. The remaining proteins were used to perform protein clustering by OrthoFinder with the all-to-all DIAMOND method and an E-value = 10 \u22125 . A dataset of 39,474 clusters was generated, and some of the clustered were removed due to a low annotation ratio of less than 50 percent of all species. Then 5,718 remaining gene families were subjected to expansion and contraction analysis using CAF\u00c9 67 (version 4.2.1), and a stochastic birth-and-death model was adopted. The phylogenetic tree with divergence time was obtained with MCMCTREE analysis in PAML. Identification of positively selected genes. A total of 9,306 gene families were identified by OrthoFinder, and 4,546 single-copy orthologous genes were generated to perform positive selection analysis, which annotated at least 60% of the sixteen genomes. The sequences of orthologous genes were aligned by MAFFT software (version 7.455), and a gene tree was generated from the species tree based on the remaining species. The branch-site model in PAML was used to detect PSGs along specific lineages with model A (model = 2 and NSsites = 2). A likelihood ratio test (LRT) was performed to compare model A (sites under positive selection in the foreground; fix_omega = 0) with the null model (sites might evolve neutrally/ under purifying selection; fix_omega = 1 and omega = 1) by the codeml program in PAML. The P values from the LRTs were evaluated via chi-square statistics, a false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated, and the cut-off was set to 0.1. Sites with a Bayesian empirical Bayes (BEB) posterior probability greater than 95% were selected as positively selected sites in PAML. KEGG and GO enrichment analyses of PSGs were performed by KOBAS 3.0 68 with cut-offs of a P value < 0.05 in Fisher's exact tests and an FDR-corrected P value < 0.1.

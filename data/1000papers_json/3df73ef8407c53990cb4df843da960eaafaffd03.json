            "text": "Following emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly became pandemic and is presently responsible for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. There is currently no approved vaccine to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and only very few treatment options are available to manage COVID-19 patients. For development of preclinical countermeasures, reliable and well-characterized small animal disease models will be of paramount importance. Here we show that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into Syrian hamsters consistently caused moderate broncho-interstitial pneumonia, with high viral lung loads and extensive virus shedding, but animals only displayed transient mild disease. We determined the infectious dose 50 to be only five infectious particles, making the Syrian hamster a highly susceptible model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neither hamster age nor sex had any impact on the severity of disease or course of infection. Finally, prolonged viral persistence in interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain knockout hamsters revealed susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to adaptive immune control. In conclusion, the Syrian hamster is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 making it a very suitable infection model for COVID-19 countermeasure development.",

SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, which is associated with a broad range of symptoms. These symptoms are most commonly fever, dry cough and fatigue, but can also include myalgia, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion, runny nose, nausea and diarrohea. The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 2-14 days with 5-6 days being most common [2] . While the majority of infections are asymptomatic or present as mild to moderate cases, a small percentage of patients will progress into acute respiratory disease with fatal outcome [3, 4] . In the absence of a licensed vaccine and only limited treatment options available, scientific and health care communities continue their efforts to rapidly find effective countermeasures for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Aside from new drug or vaccine development, repurposing and \"off-label\" use of existing FDA-approved compounds is being heavily pursued, often omitting preclinical animal studies before moving directly into humans [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

Non-human primate (NHP) COVID-19 models have been established, and several Old-World monkey species have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection in these animals results in a transient mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia, rather than the severe clinical outcomes [9] [10] [11] . Ferrets have also been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in mild disease with shedding from the upper respiratory tract. Efficient transmission has been documented suggesting the ferret may be a valuable preclinical model for transmission but not for severe disease [12] [13] [14] .",

The mouse angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor has only low affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein leading to poor binding and entry [20, 21] . Initially, mouse susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection was increased through transduction of the respiratory tract cells using adenovirus vectors expressing human ACE2, which lead to development of non-lethal pneumonia [22, 23] . Several receptor transgenic mice have since been created, expressing human ACE2 under tissuespecific promoters or the endogenous mouse ACE2 promoter [16, [24] [25] [26] . All of these mice are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in a range of clinical signs with mild to fatal disease depending on the transgene. SARS-CoV-2 adaptation to mice has also been attempted through either serial passaging or reverse genetics. So far this approach has sensitized multiple strains of mice to infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, leading to very mild disease [15, 27] .",

However, these studies have used varying doses of SARS-CoV-2 for inoculation, and the impact of age and sex on infection and disease is unclear. Herein, we defined the Syrian hamster as a SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease model and refined further virologic and host parameters to increase the value of this small animal model. First, we demonstrated high functional interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with the hamster ACE2 receptor. Next, we determined the SARS-CoV-2 dose causing infection in 50% of animals (ID 50 ) following intranasal infection, showing these animals to be highly susceptible to infection. We detailed the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also the effect of sex and age on SARS-CoV-2 infection in the model. Finally, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection of interleukin 2 receptor, gamma chain (IL2RG) knockout hamsters to assess the impact of adaptive (and NK) immunity in this model.",

To validate that that SARS-CoV-2 can bind and then use as an entry receptor the Syrian hamster ACE2 receptor, a VSV pseudotype assay was performed as previously published [20] . Briefly, a chimeric SARS-CoV-1 spike protein was generated with the RBD replaced with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (VSV-SARS-CoV-2-RBD), a psuedotype that has previously shown comparable binding to ACE-2 as the WT [20, 32] . We transfected BHK cells that do not express ACE2 with expression plasmids for either human or hamster ACE2, or empty vector as a negative control. Cells were then infected with the VSV pseudotyped particles carrying either SARS-CoV-1 full-length spike (VSV-SARS-CoV-1-RBD) or chimeric VSV-SARS-CoV-2-RBD. As anticipated, both VSV-SARS-COV-1-RBD and VSV-SARS-CoV-2-RBD were unable to enter BKH cells, but entry was rescued in transduced cells expressing the hamster or human ACE2. Interestingly, VSV-SARS-CoV-2-RBD entry was increased compared to VSV-SARS-CoV-1-RBD, independent of the ACE2 origin, which may indicate higher susceptibility of both hamsters and humans to SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 ( Figure 1 ).",

Groups were intranasally infected with a ten-fold serial dilution series of virus ranging from 10 3 to 10 0 TCID 50 , and infection course was monitored by signs of disease including weight and temperature. Although no significant changes in temperature over the experimental period were observed, weight loss between the animal groups directly correlated with the infectious dose ( Figure 2 (A)). Oral and rectal swabs were taken at 3 days post infection (dpi) and 5dpi to measure differences in levels of viral gRNA between the different groups. Only one animal in the group receiving the 1 TCID 50 dose had detectable gRNA in the oral swabs and none in the rectal swab ( Figure 2 (B)), with only half the animals in this group being positive at 5dpi (Figure 2(C)). Lungs were harvested at 5dpi and gRNA and infectious titres were determined. Remarkably similar gRNA levels were found across groups infected with 10 TCID 50 or higher, only the 1 TCID 50 group had a significant reduction in gRNA levels ( Figure 2(D) ). Infectious titres from the lungs of each dose group had a similar pattern with high viral loads in all groups, except the 1 TCID 50 group for which no infectious virus was detected (Figure 2 (E)).

To characterize the extent of disease in this model, two groups of 10 Syrian hamsters aged 4-6 weeks were intranasally infected with either 500 ID 50 (low dose; 10 3 TCID 50 ) or 5 \u00d7 10 4 ID 50 (high dose; 10 5 TCID 50 ) of SARS-CoV-2. Animals were monitored for clinical symptoms of disease with the intent of euthanizing a subset of animals for analysis when early symptoms became apparent. At 3dpi hamsters in both groups had lost weight on consecutive days (Figure 3(A) ) and displayed slightly ruffled fur with minor changes in respiration pattern. Four animals from each group were euthanized at this time (3dpi) for analysis. Lungs were examined for gross pathology and all animals had lung lesions consisting of focal extensive areas of pulmonary edema and consolidation with evidence of interstitial pneumonia characterized by a failure of the lungs to collapse following removal. No gross pathology was observed in other tissues collected including liver, spleen, kidney and brain. The remaining hamsters continued to lose weight until 5dpi with a maximum loss of <10% body weight (Figure 3(A) ); clinical signs remained similar until 5dpi. Three more animals from each group were euthanized at this time (5dpi). At necropsy, an increase in both number and severity of lesions were observed in animals receiving the low dose, but gross pathology was similar in appearance at 3dpi and 5dpi in animals receiving the high dose. Following four consecutive days of weight gain (Figure 3(A) ) and improving clinical signs, the remaining animals from each group were euthanized at 10dpi. Gross examination of the lungs at 10dpi showed a significant reduction in both lesion severity and congestion relative to lungs taken earlier during disease progression. Despite the obvious development of respiratory disease at earlier times postinfection, clinical signs were minimal at this stage (10dpi) with animals having recovered weight ( Figure  3(A) ). Oral and rectal swabs were collected at each time point to monitor viral gRNA shedding. Shedding peaked in all swab types at 3dpi with a small decrease at 5dpi before dropping significantly at 10dpi (Figure 3 (B,C)). Lungs were evaluated for both SARS-CoV-2 gRNA and infectious titres. gRNA loads in the lungs were high with >10 10 genome copies/gram ( Figure 3 (D)), whereas gRNA loads in other organs were approximately 4-5 logs lower (Sup. Figure 1 ). Lung infectious titres were 10 7 TCID 50 per gram at 3dpi although this had already decreased at 5dpi and was absent in all but one animal at 10dpi (Figure 3 (E)). Overall, there was no significant difference between the groups infected with the low and high dose of SARS-CoV-2, except for 10dpi where one animal remained positive.",

Interestingly, no significant histopathologic lesions were observed in the evaluated sections of liver, kidney and spleen of any animal regardless of age, sex or inoculation dose used in these studies. Immunohistochemistry also failed to reveal SARS-CoV-2 antigen in the liver, kidney and spleens examined. Pathologically, changes associated with disease in the lower respiratory tract were noted in both the trachea and lung regardless of the inoculation dose. The observed pathology had a more distinct progression in the low (500 ID 50 ) inoculation dose than the higher dosed group (5 \u00d7 10 4 ID 50 ). Evidence of bronchointerstitial pneumonia was observed at all evaluated time points. At 3dpi, lesions were characterized by epithelial necrosis in the trachea and bronchioles, squamous metaplasia of the mucosa in the trachea, bronchiolitis characterized by influx of neutrophils and macrophages into the lamina propria and mild interstitial pneumonia with expansion of alveolar septa by edema fluid, with few strands of fibrin and low numbers of leukocytes (Figure 4(A-C) ). By 5dpi, the interstitial pneumonia was moderate to severe with fibrin leaking into alveolar spaces, alveolar edema, influx of moderate numbers to numerous neutrophils and macrophages into alveolar spaces, presence of syncytial cells in bronchioles and alveolar spaces and prominent type II pneumocyte hyperplasia ( Figure 4(D-F) ). Evidence of lesion resolution was observed at 10dpi with a decrease in alveolar cellular exudate, absence of epithelial necrosis and a prominent \"honeycombing\" pattern of type II pneumocyte hyperplasia centred on terminal bronchioles with septal expansion by a small to moderate amount of fibrosis (Figure 4 (G-I)) as compared to na\u00efve infected control animals (Figure 4(J-L) ). Mild and multifocal pleural fibrosis was observed at 10dpi ( Figure 5 ). At both 5dpi and 10dpi, moderate numbers of blood vessels were surrounded by perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes that frequently formed distinct perivascular cuffs, occasionally focally disrupting the tunica media or forming aggregates between the tunica intima and media elevating the endothelium into the lumen. Immunohistochemical reaction demonstrated viral antigen in bronchiole epithelial cells at 3dpi ( Figure 5(A-C) ) with fewer cells showing immunoreactivity at 5dpi ( Figure 5 (D-E)) and no epithelial cells exhibiting immunoreactivity at 10dpi ( Figure 5(G-I) ). Lower in the respiratory tree, SARS-CoV-2 immunoreactivity was demonstrated in type I and II pneumocytes as well as alveolar macrophages at 3dpi and 5dpi with a lack of immunoreactivity at 10dpi ( Figure 5 (G-I)) which is comparable to uninfected control tissue ( Figure 5 (J-L)) Overall, pathologic changes progressed more rapidly in animals infected with the high dose relative to the low dose, but severity of disease was consistent between the groups with all animals developing moderate to severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia, commensurate with a mild to moderate infection model.",

To help determine disease severity, lung weights were recorded and calculated as a percentage of overall body weight for comparison. Lungs weights paralleled the observed lesions and were significantly increased at 5dpi (Supp. Figure  2B ).

IL2RG KO hamsters are unable to develop mature NK cells with compromised development of T and B lymphocytes [29, 34] . This lack of mature lymphoid cells results in an immunocompromised status known as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) in humans [35] . To ask the question of whether these key cellular aspects of the innate (NK) and adaptive (B and T cells) impact SARS-CoV-2 replication and associated disease, we assessed infection in IL2RG KO hamsters. Similar to immunocompetent Syrian hamsters, following infection with 5 \u00d7 10 4 ID 50 (high dose; 10 5 TCID 50 ) of SARS-CoV-2, four (2 males, 2 females) IL2RG KO hamsters lost approximately 5-10% of their body weight over the first 5 days following infection before recovering (Figure 7(A) ). Oral and rectal swabs were taken at 5dpi and 24dpi to measure shedding. Interestingly, both oral and rectal swabs were positive at both time-points and at very similar levels (Figure 7(B) ). All four hamsters were euthanized 24dpi following 2 weeks of consistent weight gain and lungs were examined for disease. At examination, the lungs had lesions similar to the immunocompetent hamsters at 5dpi, were congested and failed to collapse. Remarkably, virus titration performed on lung tissue revealed high infectious titres ranging from 10 7 -10 9 TCID 50 per gram of tissue, even at 24dpi (Figure 7(C) ).",

Virus was detectable in oral and rectal swabs at 5dpi and at study termination (24dpi). Histopathology evaluated at 24dpi supports a chronic-active infection of the respiratory system with foci of epithelial regeneration as well as active recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Unlike the immunocompetent hamster model, in which antigen was only detectable outside of regions of pathology, SARS-CoV-2 antigen was detectable in type I and type II pneumocytes, hyperplastic pneumocytes in regions of regeneration and macrophages. Additionally, viral antigen was present in morphologically normal bronchial epithelial cells at 24dpi, a feature only routinely observed at 3dpi in the immunocompetent hamster model. While histopathology revealed a moderate to severe pulmonary inflammatory response, clinical signs of severe respiratory disease was not observed in this model. These data suggest that the innate immune system, in the background of compromised adaptive immunity, is capable of depressing the viral infection enough to keep respiratory physiology relatively stable, but incapable of eliminating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, vascular changes and perivascular leukocyte infiltrates were not observed in the IL2RG KO model, unlike the immunocompetent hamster model. This data, even though limited to four animals, suggests that the adaptive immune response or IL-2 signalling pathway may play a critical role in the development of innate leukocyte recruitment and staging during viral infection and the regulation of the coagulation cascade in response to a pro-inflammatory local environment.",

A large body of evidence is demonstrating, instead, that EVs do have an essential function as smart bioshuttles of lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and other metabolites, and are naturally conceived to target cells by driving cell-cell communication, even between different organisms and species, thus regulating diverse biological and physiological processes [2] [3] [4] .",

Very recently, round-shaped EVs were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation of a sampling solution containing root exudates of hydroponically grown tomato plants [24] . Nanovesicles have also been purified from the apoplast, which includes all the extracellular compartments, the cell wall, the xylem, and gas-and water-filled intercellular spaces. Thus far, apoplastic vesicles have been described in Arabidopsis thaliana [25] and Helianthus annuus [26] . speed steps ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 g for 1-3 h are used to precipitate EVs.

The formation and secretion of pure extracellular vesicles require multistep cellular processes well documented in animals [36] . Similar mechanisms have been described in plants ( Figure 2 ). For instance, growing evidence suggests that vesicles destinated to extracellular space accumulate as intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) in plant multivesicular bodies (MVB) and are released by the fusion between MVBs and the plasma membrane. The MVB pathway is central for the turnover of transmembrane proteins and in eukaryotic cells [37] . The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) is the most important multi-protein complex responsible for the formation of MVBs and ILVs. It works as an ubiquitin-dependent mechanism, which binds and sequesters ubiquitinated proteins and sorts them into the ILVs of multi-vesicular bodies [38] . The ESCRT machinery is well conserved in plants, although ESCRT-0, involved in the initial targeting of the ubiquitinated cargo and the recruitment of the downstream ESCRT components, has not yet described in plants. Members of TOM1like (TOL) protein family has been suggested as a plant-specific functional substitute for the ESCRT-0 in the initial targeting of ubiquitinated plasma membrane proteins destined for degradation [39] . However, more efforts are needed to uncover potential plant ESCRT genes and eventually establish the contribution of each component of this pathway in plant EV biogenesis, as already described for mammalian EVs.",

The chemical composition of PDVs can vary greatly and give hints on the biological role of these vesicles in plants. PDVs have a high percentage of lipids whose composition and assembly seem to be very important for understanding the uptake mechanisms of the vesicles themselves. In particular, in many vesicles there is the presence of phosphatidic acid (PA), which appears to be involved in the membrane fusion mechanisms [41] . In addition to lipids, plant PDV carry distinct classes of biomolecules. They are rich in proteins that may play specific functions, such as proteins involved in the defense against pathogens or in response to biotic and abiotic stress and enzymes involved in the synthesis of the cell wall ( Figure 3 ). Moreover, many EV surface proteins are transmembrane proteins, often derived from MVB or from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), which are used as molecular markers for their identification [42] . PDVs also contain small RNAs and miRNAs molecules that appear to participate in the intercellular communication between cells of organisms belonging to different species or to different kingdoms [43] .",

They could be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, probably activating the expression of specific genes with a mechanism similar to that described for small activating RNAs (saRNAs) in mammals. EVs, carrying tiny RNAs, might play an important role in the transfer of genetic information in the plant [5] .

In particular, a proteomic study highlighted that about 47% of the proteins identified in the EVs-enriched fraction from sunflower (Helianthus annuus) apoplastic fluids are proteins related to the cell wall [6] . Sunflower EVs show an enrichment of proteins associated with carbohydrate metabolism. Many of these proteins such as glycosyl hydrolases (GH), expansins, and arabinogalactan proteins are already known to be involved in the degradation and reorganization of the cell wall. Other important proteins such as proteases, Kunitz-inhibitors, peroxidases, GDSL lipases, germin-like proteins, lipid-transfer proteins, and multicopper oxidases normally associated with cell wall activities have been identified in sunflower EVs. Cell wall-related proteins were also identified in Arabidopsis apoplastic vesicles [25] .",

Similarly, grapefruit-derived vesicles revealed an enrichment in phosphatidylethanolamine (45.52%) and phosphatidylcholine (28.53%). PDVs of grapes, sunflowers, and ginger contain phosphatidic acid (PA) as well [10] . Besides playing an important role in the mechanism of fusion of the membranes and in the release of these vesicles, PA is as an important class of lipid messengers involved in many cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation, and survival [56] . Other studies have shown that phosphatidylcholine of ginger EVs plays an important role in the migration from the intestine, where they accumulate following intake into the liver [57] . Not least, therapeutic addition of PC to the colonic mucus may alleviate the inflammatory activity, indicating that part of the beneficial effects of PDV in the gastrointestinal tract may be attributed to the significant presence of PC [58] . It has also been shown that plant Evs are able to modify the composition and localization of intestinal microbiota bacteria and that lipids determine selective PDV entry in bacteria species. For example, the presence of phosphatidic acid is fundamental to drive the entry of ginger-derived vesicles in Lactobacillus rhamnosu, and phosphatidylcholine is essential for the uptake of grapefruit-derived vesicles by the bacterial family of Ruminococcaceae [57] . A further functional evidences of bioactive lipids came from ginger exosome-like nanoparticles (G-ELNs).

Next-generation sequencing analysis of GELN RNA revealed that GELNs contained at least 109 mature miRNAs that could target numerous bacterial mRNA. In particular, in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease with DSS-induced colitis, ath-miR167a could bind the pilus protein SpaC mRNA and induce its downregulation in Lactobacillus rhamnosus, reducing its translocation into the peripheral blood and concomitantly increasing the permanence on mucosal surfaces. In addition, the gma-miR396e of GELNs promotes L. rhamnosus growth at least in part through the inhibition of LexA expression. Altogether, these data show how diet ELN miRNAs can cross-talk with gut microbiota to maintain gut health. Moreover, ginger RNA may modulate the production of the biologically active metabolite indole 3-acetaldehyde, synthesized by some species of the genus Lactobacillus, which stimulates the production of interleukin-22, a cytokine which improves the stabilization of the mucosa in cases of colitis [57] .",

This protein plays a key role in the onset of the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of these drugs; EVs could therefore influence the effects of glucocorticoids by regulating the expression of this gene and could have immunosuppressive properties.",

The use of specific inhibitors targeting cell entry pathways also proved that grapefruit EVs were taken up through macropinocytosis and by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Similarly, ginger EVs are internalized by macropinocytosis in hepatocytes, whereas cell uptake occurs prevalently through phagocytosis in colon cancer cells [79, 80] .

For instance, vesicles extracted from lemon juice (Citrus limon) were tested on different tumor cell lines showing reduction of 50% of the growth and tumor progression 48 h post-treatment [83] . Interestingly, lemon-derived vesicles did not impair the growth of non-cancerous cell lines, demonstrating selective bioactivity in tumor cells. Lemon-derived vesicles increases the levels of mRNAs coding for pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad and Bax and lower expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as survivin and Bcl-xl. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its receptor DR5 were found to be up-regulated in EVs-treated tumor cells. Antineoplastic effects of EVs derived from lemon were also tested in vivo using a xenograft model of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Interestingly, EVs injected into peritoneal cavity were able to target the tumor site and reduce tumor size in mice. Lemon-derived vesicles enhanced the expression of apoptotic factors and reduced the concentration of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF-A, IL6, and IL8 in serum. These results suggested that the lemon EVs are able to reduce tumor growth in vivo, either by inducing TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, or by inhibiting the process of tumor angiogenesis [83] . Stanley and colleagues have recently provided confirmations of antitumor activities of Citrus-derived vesicles [74] . In particular, nano (NVs) and microvesicles (MVs) purified from orange, bitter orange, lemon, and grapefruit were demonstrated to specifically inhibit in vitro the proliferation of lung, skin, and breast cancer cells, with no substantial detrimental effects on the growth of non-cancer cells. Grapefruit-derived vesicles also suppressed G0/G1 and G2/M cell cycle transitions, promoted the upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21, reduced the expression levels of various critical hallmarks of melanoma, such as those involved in tumor invasiveness and migration. These findings suggest that PDVs might be considered as co-adjuvants for the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat human malignancies.",

Intensive integrated omics analyses are as well instrumental to pinpoint the distinct biomolecule profiles of the different classes of plant vesicles, thus allowing to design targeted therapy for different human diseases. In this direction, basic and clinical research on PDV bioactivities needs to be extended to a larger number of cell lines and mammalian models.",

            "text": "Finally, dissecting the biogenesis pathways and the genetic pattern controlling plant EV release may lay the foundation for designing genetic engineering approaches aiming at controlling and boosting EV production. Such innovative biotechnological strategies could lead to the production of plants able to secrete a greater amount of extracellular vesicles and/or to improve the compartmentalization of specific bioactive molecules in EVs. Another attractive goal is to engineer plants producing EVs expressing specific flags on their surface for precise cell targeting, thus promoting specific internalization and ameliorating their therapeutic activity.

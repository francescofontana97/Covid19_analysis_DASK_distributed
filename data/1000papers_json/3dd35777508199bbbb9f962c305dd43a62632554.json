Frontline workers who have been in direct, in-person contact with patients diagnosed with or being treated/evaluated for symptoms related to COVID-19 are more prone to contracting it than someone who works exclusively from home. I work on a per-diem basis at a nonprofit acute care hospital with general medical and surgical inpatient care services in the Greater Boston Area. Two of my nurse managers contracted the disease in the early phases of the pandemic and fortunately recovered. One practicing neurologist died from COVID-19. Numerous others including staff nurses and certified nursing assistants became infected with the virus, lived in self-isolation, and gradually came back to work. Dr Breen succumbed to the virus, recovered, and also returned to work. Yet, she still committed suicide, an outcome likely resulting from provider burnout left unaddressed.",

Burnout has been linked to other mental health illnesses such as depression. For example, \"a new understanding of this linkage comes from a recent longitudinal study in Finland (8), which found a reciprocal relationship between burnout and depression, with each predicting subsequent developments in the other\" (p. 108). In another longitudinal study in Japan, researchers examined the link between overwork-related mental disorders and incidences of suicide (9) . Cases occurred in 1371 men and 619 women total. Particularly higher cases were seen in men aged 29 years or younger. Significant vulnerable work groups were \"accommodation/ eating/drinking services,\" \"information/communication,\" and \"scientific research, professional and technical services\" (9) . In Dr Breen's case, the causes that led to her own death are unknown; however, it is likely that physical illness namely, Coronavirus, was a contributing factor. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, predictive factors of suicide include, but are not limited to physical illness, isolation, the feeling of having no one to talk to, unwillingness to seek help because of the stigma attached to mental health, substance abuse disorders or to suicidal thoughts, and feelings of hopelessness (10) .",

As a practicing RN, it holds a new meaning for me where its focus not only applies to patients but also to the very people, like me, who take care of them. However, mental health often times goes neglected in the name of certain virtues such as altruism and heroism by which many frontline workers live. In the midst of a worldwide pandemic, the call to serve just cannot go unanswered. My nursing colleagues and I have been flexible while providing nursing care under policies and workplace arrangements which frequently change based upon new information presented to us about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The demanding and ever-changing work conditions contribute to work-related stress, nonetheless. Higher levels of burnout have been consistently reported in nurses who work in the following subspecialties: Psychiatric Units, Emergency Department, and especially intensive care unit/critical care units (3, 4) .",

Providing periods of undisturbed rest can aid in environmental relief and psychospiritual transcendence. Frequent contact with family and friends in-person (eg, 1-hour hospital visitor policy) or via video chat (eg, FaceTime) can increase sociocultural ease and transcendence. The patient can experience environmental relief and ease by dimming the lights as well as psychospiritual relief by minimizing external stimuli to prevent anxiety.

On the other hand, resilient frontline workers may rely on their strong support systems and coping skills to provide the delicate balance they need on a daily basis to thrive as opposed to survive. For example, Laschinger and Nosko surveyed 631 experienced and 244 newly graduated acute care nurses and found their \"psychological capital\" or positive psychological state of development characterized by hope, optimism, self-efficacy, and resilience were associated with lower levels of burnout and post-traumatic stress (17) .

These activities can enhance psychospiritual ease. My sister and I have completed three 1000-piece puzzles together which was extremely satisfying. It gave me a sense of normalcy that I could still problem-solve by connecting pieces of the picture puzzle back together all the while living in a world filled with contagious panic and chaos. Taking light walks, running, jogging, fishing, being near the beach to lower stress and anxiety can increase physical, environmental and psychospiritual relief, ease, and transcendence. When I went out for a run, not only did my Fitbit notify me that my physical activity level increased but I also found it to be quite peaceful. I became inspired to take advantage of my hour of recreation more often after seeing 2 to 3 runners along the way as well. Environmental relief, ease, and transcendence can be attained by taking a vacation.

I have found this to be true after attending a Sunday church service on the \"Facebook Watch Party\" platform to which my former college pastor invited me to worship alongside a multitude of fellow believers. Participating in the chat box, listening to the sermon, and singing along with the hymns provided me with sociocultural ease and psychospiritual transcendence. \"Be gentle with yourself and practice self-compassion to make life easier to bear,\" my pastor said.

We must not forget to take inventory of our own mental health as well as identify possible signs of burnout. Let us all learn from the case of the beloved Dr Breen: She seemly had it \"altogether\" with supportive friends, families, and colleagues, yet still attempted and completed suicide. Moreover, Mr Mondello was a relatively younger EMT with a lifelong career ahead of him, yet still took his own life. These two fallen heroes show that cultivating mental health is indeed a vital practice to invest in during this critical period in which many frontline workers are currently entrenched. If death is the most moving conclusion, then Dr Breen and Mr Mondello's suicide and legacy should not go in vain. Although we solemnly remember the dead, there are many unsung heroes left fighting this war against coronavirus who may need this direction before it is too late. My only ask from YOU is to take some time and reflect on answering this question: When I recover, who or what will be my comfort?",

What comfort means to one person, may not be true for another. However, engaging in self-care practices, an essential part of one's health and well-being, remains paramount to reduce burnout and suicide that the novel coronavirus pandemic has caused (eg, physical illness, turning family members away, self-isolation, prolonged stay-at-home orders, 100K\u00fe death tolls, etc). Practicing from a theoretical framework of comfort resonates with my nurse colleagues and me because it makes sense. Implementing the Kolcaba Comfort Theory in our daily lives may act as a protective barrier against the mental health impact of COVID-19 in 2020 and beyond.",

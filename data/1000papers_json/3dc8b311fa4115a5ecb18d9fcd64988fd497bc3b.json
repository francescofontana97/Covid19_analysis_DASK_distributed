This cross sectional study aimed to compare the psychosocial status between healthcare workers and general population during the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in southeast Iran. Totally 415 health care workers of a medical service center for COVID-19 patients and 1023 people of general population participated in the study. An online socio-demographic characteristics questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ \u221228), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) were utilized to evaluate psychosocial status. According to GHQ, the psychological disorders of the HCWs were significantly higher than that of the general population (P < 0.001). According to GAD-7, no significant difference was found between general population and HCWs. Multivariate logistic analysis showed no difference between general population and HCWs in the psychological disorder. Although HCWs suffered from psychological disorders more than general population, nearly one third to half of the participants in both groups had psychosocial disorders.",

Important psychological morbidities ranged from symptoms and signs of post-traumatic stress disorder such as depression, anxiety, distress and psychosocial attacks to delirium and psychosis (M\u00fcller, 2014) . The COVID-19 epidemic may initiate new psychotic disorders in the general population without mental disorder at the individual level, also irritates others to mental issues disorder and triggers anxiety to the medical staff of the individuals impacted. Irrespective of contact, people may experience anxiety and fear about being sick or dying, powerless or blaming those who are sick, causing severe a mental breakdown (Hall et al., 2008) .

Since after death the infection can be spread, traditional burial procedures are not performed such disturbances to traditional processes can lead to anger or anxiety, which can limit access to support from the community (Organization, 2014) . Even a sense of sadness is felt while hearing about the deaths of community members in general.

Clinical respondents, including emergency staff and HCWs, can also experience elevated anxiety, be physically and mentally depressed and have higher levels of anxiety and worry . The HCWs' fear and anxiety is more due to their being at increased risk of the infection. Perhaps there is a concern that it would spread to their family members and kids. To several HCWs, the work tasks and responsibilities, humanism and personal anxiety often create tension and stress (Tiong & Koh, 2013) . Psychosocial risk factors are not limited to work-related stress (Chirico, 2015) , rather they include new and emerging psychosocial risk factors, such as the combined exposure to physical and psychosocial risks, job insecurity, work intensification and high demands at work, high emotional load related to burnout, work-life balance problems, and violence and harassment at work (F Chirico, 2017; Francesco Chirico, 2017a , 2017b .

They would develop higher levels of depression, since they cannot adjust to these rapid variations in work culture in a short period. Loss of job during quarantine or job changes that earned less than before the COVID-19 period were important issue of psychosocial disorders for the people. The bivariate analysis in general population and the multivariate logistic regression in total samples revealed that the unmarried participants had significantly higher psychosocial disorders; this result was consistent with that of Liang et al. . This difference may be due to family relationship and the feeling of loneliness and hopeless in single participants.

Thinking of being at risk for infection with the coronavirus is one of the psychological disorders in HCWs that may be improved with transfer of the hospital instructions for COVID19 to all staff and following clear procedures in infection management is essential. There must also be protective measures to ensure that HCWs will not become infected when exposing to the COVID-19 at the workplace.

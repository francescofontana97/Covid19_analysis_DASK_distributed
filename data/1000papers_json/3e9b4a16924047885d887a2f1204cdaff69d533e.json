We propose a mechanistic understanding of human-reservoir interactions, using hantavirus pulmonary syndrome as a case study. Crucial processes underpinning the disease's incidence remain poorly studied, including the connectivity among natural and peridomestic deer mouse host activity, virus transmission, and human exposure. We found that disease cases were greatest in arid states and declined exponentially with increasing precipitation. Within arid environments, relatively rare climatic conditions (e.g., El Ni\u00f1o) are associated with increased rainfall and reservoir abundance, producing more frequent virus transmission and host dispersal. We suggest that deer mice increase their occupancy of peridomestic structures during spring-summer, amplifying intraspecific transmission and human infection risk. Disease incidence in arid states may increase with predicted climatic changes.

Pathogen emergence is generally characterized by factors, often environmental, driving increased reservoir-human interactions (e.g., Plowright et al. 2011 ). An appreciation of the ecological interactions between reservoirs and humans and the drivers of these interactions is therefore crucial for predicting and controlling human exposure.

Humans typically become exposed through the inhalation of or direct contact with the infectious virus in rodent reservoir excreta, but the mechanisms that underscore reservoir-human interactions for these viruses-and many other pathogens-are poorly understood. In the mid-1990s, a hantavirus, Sin Nombre virus (SNV), emerged in the United States as the cause of the often-fatal hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The emergence of SNV is linked to changes in climate, but the mechanisms underlying this link are debated (Mills et al. 2010a ). Here, we emphasize reservoir-human interactions and their determinants, focusing on the ecology of SNV, its North American deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) reservoir, and the reservoir-human interactions leading to HPS. Following the emergence of SNV, a large body of knowledge has been developed across broad geographic and temporal scales, providing the foundation for this article. In this article, we ask the following: What are the drivers that underscore these human-reservoir interactions and HPS cases in North America? Although there are several hantaviruses and rodent hosts in the Americas, we have focused on the North American deer mouse (hereafter deer mouse) and SNV, which are responsible for the overwhelming majority of HPS cases in North America (Mills et al. 2010a) . We first summarize the ecology and epidemiology of SNV, describe the emergence of SNV and HPS in the southwestern United States, and consider the environmental factors linked to this emergence. We then propose an alternative hypothesis about the drivers of SNV reservoir-human interactions, which we hope will advance our understanding of HPS-SNV ecology beyond the current ideas derived from simplistic trophic cascade models. We hypothesize that human exposure to SNV is driven by environmental factors that alter deer mouse behavior and that this relationship is greatest in arid environments. We present two case studies based on data extracted from the literature, with analyses that evaluate this novel prediction at regional and local scales. These studies contribute significant insight into the geographic variation in HPS cases across North America, and we suggest that this variation is primarily driven by climate and reservoir population abundance. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of changing climatic conditions in North America and implications for reservoir-human interactions, particularly among states with high numbers of HPS cases. We suggest that the changing climatic conditions in US states with high numbers of HPS cases will likely promote human-deer mouse interactions and increased HPS incidence. This approach is of broad conceptual value for enhancing our understanding of the ecology of hantaviruses and directly transmitted pathogens globally, owing to a significant gap in the literature on directly transmitted pathogens, as compared with research on vector-borne pathogens (Mills et al. 2010b ).

A third outbreak in 2006, following increased precipitation in 2004-2005 , was forecast using satellite imagery as an indicator of primary productivity (Glass et al. 2006) . Parmenter and colleagues (1993) and Yates and colleages (2002) proposed a bottom-up precipitation-driven trophic cascade to explain the HPS outbreaks. The proposed cascade involved increased primary and secondary productivity (measures of deer mouse resources) during spring-summer, following enhanced winter-spring precipitation. Increases in productivity were followed by increases in deer mouse abundance, infection prevalence, and ultimately, HPS cases. However, this proposed cascade continues to be discussed because of debate over regional increases in deer mouse abundance and the relationships between vegetation growth and HPS cases (Glass et al. 2000 , Mills 2005 ). Glass and colleagues (2000) concluded that ENSO events in the Four Corners region likely supported an expansion of deer mouse range from suitable habitat to temporarily favorable habitat that was normally suboptimal (too arid) for their survival or limiting of population growth. Following the ENSO events, these temporarily favorable environments returned to less optimal normal conditions. Glass and colleagues (2000) concluded that if links between climate variability and HPS exist (cf.

Temperature and precipitation fluctuated between beneficial or detrimental effects on deer mouse survival and recruitment depending on season (Luis et al. 2010) , and these effects are likely to vary among habitats and climatic regimes (see also Loehman et al. 2012) .

Studies demonstrate that deer mice in peridomestic environments frequently enter man made structures (particularly if food resources are available) regardless of prevailing environmental conditions, have smaller home range sizes, have greater population densities, and constitute a greater proportion of the small-mammal community than in natural environments (Kuenzi et al. 2001 , Douglass et al. 2006 .

Deer mouse excreta likely accumulate and SNV survives longer in peridomestic settings, because it is largely protected from environmental conditions that would disperse and degrade excreta (i.e., wind and precipitation) and inactivate SNV (i.e., ultraviolet radiation; Carver et al. 2010) . Consequently, the persistence of infectious SNV is likely longer and the risk of exposure for humans greater in peridomestic locations (Kallio et al. 2006 , Gedeon et al. 2010 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 701, "end": 720, "text": "(Kuenzi et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 721, "end": 743, "text": ", Douglass et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 839, "end": 861, "text": "(Douglass et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1152, "text": "Carver et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1309, "text": "(Kallio et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1330, "text": ", Gedeon et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Transmission within reservoir populations"}, {"text": "In order to mitigate the incidence of HPS, it would be useful to predict human cases using climatic factors, with a clear understanding of the mechanisms that underscore HPS cases at local and broad geographic scales.

Our hypotheses and findings linking environmental moisture and, to a lesser extent, temperature to HPS cases help to mechanistically explain the variation in cases of HPS at local and broad geographic scales. In particular, HPS cases showed an exponential decline associated with increasing average daily precipitation at a regional scale. However, local (natural) deer mouse abundance-not the indirect environmental effectswas the best predictor of HPS cases 3 months later, during spring-summer. This result suggests that in the arid environment of Zuni, New Mexico, HPS cases (and possibly prolonged peridomestic occupancy by deer mice and associated SNV transmission) may primarily be a functional response to natural deer mouse abundance 3 months prior rather than a response to environmental effects. The three-month delay Table 3 . could reflect a number of ecological processes, including the movement of deer mice from natural to peridomestic environments, the amplification of peridomestic transmission among deer mice, the accumulation of SNV-contaminated excreta, and human behaviors that aerosolize particulates. We propose that in arid and potentially semiarid regions, environmental conditions (e.g., as occurring in La Ni\u00f1a-El Ni\u00f1o oscillations in the southwestern United States) led to the local amplification and dispersal of deer mice to these normally suboptimal areas and may therefore be an important driver of prolonged peridomestic occupancy and, consequently, HPS cases. Figure 6 illustrates our findings and proposed mechanisms and is particularly relevant to arid environments. We also suggest a framework for how a differential equation model could be structured to model these suggested dynamics (figure 7). We expect that in areas normally suboptimal for deer mouse survival, peridomestic occupancy would likely be proportional to natural deer mouse abundance in the months prior. During the summer, peridomestic structures in arid environments are cooler and more humid than the natural environment (Erlandson et al. 2003 ) and therefore are more suitable for the survival of rodents (Studier and Baca 1968 ) and the persistence of SNV (Kaillio et al. 2006 ). Our proposed mechanism and supporting model have not yet been empirically tested, but the results of this study suggest it is a crucial frontier for understanding SNV and HPS (table 4) . It is important to acknowledge that the deer mouse and SNV data available for these analyses are from natural sites, and the strength of their relationships to HPS cases in our analyses would likely be significantly improved by matching data from relevant peridomestic sites. Additional research quantifying the environmental determinants of the propensity of deer mice to move from occupying natural to occupying peridomestic environments would also improve insight into the mechanisms underscoring reservoir-human interactions and HPS exposure. No published study has made temporally paired comparisons of deer mouse abundance between natural and peridomestic habitats or how transmission rates among deer mice change within buildings or along a moisture gradient. We took a broadscale, state-average approach to evaluating the national relationships of climate to deer mice and HPS cases. Future studies using more spatially explicit climatic data at this scale would be valuable. There are also unanswered questions concerning the components of human-deer mouse interactions and SNV transmission: (a) How is the amount of deer mouse excreta in aerosolizable particulate matter influenced by peridomestic deer mouse abundance and building occupancy? (b) How is aerosolization of particulate matter affected by environmental humidity? (c) What are the temporal patterns of SNV shedding following deer mouse exposure, and what is the environmental persistence of SNV in their excreta? (This includes the development of more sensitive SNV detection techniques; Botten et al. 2002) (d) How do human activities and their seasonality in rural peridomestic environments vary (e.g., Cline et al. 2010 ) and affect SNV transmission? (e) What quantities of aerosolized particulate matter are generated by various anthropogenic activities (e.g., Richardson et al. 2013 )? (f) What are the inhalation rates of particulate matter by humans during activities within these buildings? The classification of these processes will help determine the force of infection for humans, which remains poorly parameterized . This can be characterized as the inhalation of aerosolized excreta (contact rates between humans and deer mice) and the probability of becoming infected given inhalation of infectious particles (the transmission probability of SNV to humans; figure 7) .

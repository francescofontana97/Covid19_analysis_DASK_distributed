This has been proposed by several physicians and scientists who, from analyzing the forms of clinical presentation and considering the similarities of genome and structural constitution of this new virus with other members of the Coronaviride family, have suggested the need for paying more attention to pregnant women because of this potential risk. This suggestion is supported by the fact that, molecularly, there is a greater expression of the angiotensin 2 receptor (peremptory receptor for the entry of the virus into the cell) during pregnancy [4, 5] . However, almost a year after this pandemic began, and despite the large amount of medical attention focused on this population, there is no clear scientific evidence supporting this theory.",

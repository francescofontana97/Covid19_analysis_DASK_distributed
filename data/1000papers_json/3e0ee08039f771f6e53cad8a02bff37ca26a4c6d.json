Existing solution for nonpharmaceutical interventions usually needs to timely and precisely select a subset of residential urban areas for containment or even quarantine, where the spatial distribution of confirmed cases has been considered as a key criterion for the subset selection. While such containment measure has successfully stopped or slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in some countries, it is criticized for being inefficient or ineffective, as the statistics of confirmed cases are usually time-delayed and coarse-grained. To tackle the issues, we propose C-Watcher, a novel data-driven framework that aims at screening every neighborhood in a target city and predicting infection risks, prior to the spread of COVID-19 from epicenters to the city. In terms of design, C-Watcher collects large-scale long-term human mobility data from Baidu Maps, then characterizes every residential neighborhood in the city using a set of features based on urban mobility patterns. Furthermore, to transfer the firsthand knowledge (witted in epicenters) to the target city before local outbreaks, we adopt a novel adversarial encoder framework to learn \"city-invariant\" representations from the mobility-related features for precise early detection of high-risk neighborhoods, even before any confirmed cases known, in the target city. We carried out extensive experiments on C-Watcher using the real-data records in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreaks, where the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of C-Watcher for early detection of high-risk neighborhoods from a large number of cities.",

For example, the incubation period of COVID-19 is around 5-6 days on average, but it could last as long as 14 days. During such a period, a community or neighborhood would have been already invaded by a small number of asymptotic carriers who might not be with any clinical symptoms. When a small number of cases being confirmed, the community and its surrounding neighborhoods may have fallen into COVID-19 for a long time. Furthermore, though the mobility of confirmed patients is usually well restricted, the asymptomatic carriers with no symptoms would still spread the virus to where he/she has gone. When fine-grained mobility traces are not available, the administrators can only place containment measures to places in coarse-grained.",

For example, a neighborhood lacking basic living facilities may face a high risk, for the residents may passively go further away for basic living needs and face greater infection risks. Moreover, neighborhoods with poor living facilities often lack good property management, which may also lead to high infection risks. To describe these living facilities related characteristics, we construct 15 POI radius features. Each of them is defined as the shortest distance between the neighborhood and one certain type of POIs. All the used types of POIs are listed in the Appendix A.1.",

Otherwise, it is assigned \"poor\". The list of basic living facilities is also shown in the Appendix A.1. We collect the high-risk and low-risk neighborhoods data in Wuhan city in China which is officially announced by the local government. Figure 1(a) presents the ratio distribution of high-risk and lowrisk neighborhoods grouping by this \"perfect-poor\" facility label in Wuhan data. As we can see from Figure 1 (a), for the neighborhoods with feature value as \"perfect\", the ratio of low-risk neighborhoods and high-risk ones is 0.57 : 0.44; whereas the ratio of them for \"poor\" ones is 0.43 : 0.56.

For POI radius features, except the effect of perfect and poor living facility of a neighborhood (which are denoted by \"P:PFLF\" and \"P:PRLF\" in Figure 4 ), the coefficient of \"P:RTS\" indicates that the long distance to a train station can reduce the risk of the neighborhood. For the demographic features, except the high population density (denoted by \"D:PD\"), the long average commute distance (denoted by \"D:ACD\") also increases the risk of the neighborhood.

The 15 types of POIs are as follows: hospital, clinic, campus, kindergarten & primary school & secondary school (we see these three types as a whole), bus stop, subway station, airport , train station, coach station, shopping mall, supermarket, market, shop, police station, scenic spots.We also define another binary feature to directly reflect the perfect degree of basic living facilities and it will be assign \"perfect\" if there are all the following types of living facilities shown in Table 5 within 1 km of the given neighborhood. The types of living facilities within 1 km are mainly selected according to a official document released by Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China 2 .Human Attributes Features In section 3.2, we introduce 11 demographic features of a neighborhood based on distributions of residents according to the attributes shown in Table 3 Transportation-Related Features In section 3.3, we discuss transportation-related features from the perspectives of T (means of transportation) features, OD (types of visit venues and the distance between origin and destination venues) features and OTD (origin-transportation-destination pattern) features. The details of them are shown in Table 6 . ",

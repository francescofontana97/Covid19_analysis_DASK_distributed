While exciting progresses have been made, current studies mainly investigate the relationship between density matrices of difference sentence subspaces of a semantic Hilbert space. The Hilbert space as a whole which has a unique density matrix is lack of exploration. In this paper, we propose a novel Quantum Expectation Value based Language Model (QEV-LM). A unique shared density matrix is constructed for the Semantic Hilbert Space. Words and sentences are viewed as different observables in this quantum model. Under this background, a matching score describing the similarity between a question-answer pair is naturally explained as the quantum expectation value of a joint question-answer observable. In addition to the theoretical soundness, experiment results on the TREC-QA and WIKIQA datasets demonstrate the computational efficiency of our proposed model with excellent performance and low time consumption.",

The first challenge is to construct a unique density matrix shared among the word and sentence levels. In most QLMs, sentence is a semantic subspace in a quantum system and density matrix for each sentence semantic subspace is required to explored. However, in quantum theory, different statistical ensembles of pure states of the same Hilbert space can be described using the system's unique density matrix. Represented as quantum states in the Hilbert Space, words and sentences should therefore be characterized by the unique density matrix, rather than composed of distinct ones. By preserving the consistence of density matrix, the total spatial degrees of freedom of the whole system can be diminished, which will result a more robust model. Secondly, only synthetic measures, lacking self-consistent quantum correspondence, have been employed in the aforementioned models, to evaluate the correlation coefficients between questions and answers. In particular, as an essential component of matching measurements in NNQLM-II, the convolutional layer over a joint representation for a question-answer pair is devoid of an analogous explanation in quantum probability theory. In addition, the projection measurement utilized in CNM also diminishes the interpretability from the perspective of quantum mechanism.",

By direct multiplication, we build joint question-answer observables, whose quantum expectation value naturally dovetails with the matching score of question-answer pairs.

First, in most studies of quantum language models, despite a whole quantum system with a complete Hilbert space is introduced, words and sentences usually are viewed as a sub event space, described by specific density matrices. The whole quantum system's unique density matrix is lack of investigation. Second, in quantum-inspired models, only fragmented physical concept is integrated into models, without a systematical complete interpretability. For example, in NNQLM, words are endowed with physical state, but the later convolutional layer lacks of a corresponding physical explanation. In this paper, we aim to tackle the above two problems. We propose a Quantum Expectation Value based Language Model (QEV-LM). A unique density matrix is constructed which carries the whole information of the semantic Hilbert space. Words and sentences now are viewed as different observables in the same space. By calculating the expectation value of each observable using the unique density matrix, one can obtain the probability of each observable.",

The result of our model is comparable with that of CNM on MAP and better than that of CNM on MRR with a rate of 1.22%. The improvement on TREC dataset is more manifest than that on WIKIQA.

In this space, QEV-LM-real is built with word vectors and the shared density matrix replaced by their real counterparts. On TREC-QA dataset, Table 3 shows that QEV-LM-real is 0.05% and 2.97% lower than QEV-LM on MAP and MRR, respectively. On WIKIQA dataset, QEV-LM-real is lower than QEV-LM by 3.53% on MAP and 4.42% on MRR. Therefore, the imaginary part carrying additional semantic information can improve the model's performance.

But a variety of sentence observables can be designed via other flexible ways, e.g., directly maxpooling over word projectors without weights, which generates a model named as QEV-LM-no-weight. Table 3 shows that all results of QEV-LM-no-weight are quite close to those of QEV-LM, meaning that the weights are fine-tune parameters. However, when using the sentence observables with word projectors summed, on TREC-QA dataset, the results of QEV-LM-sum drop dramatically from those of QEV-LM by 18.22% on MAP and 17.02% on MRR; on WIKIQA dataset, there is also a big jump on both MAP and MRR. Even though the more important words contribute more to the sentence observable, after accumulation in summation irrelevant words can introduce a lot noise. Especially, compared to traditional sentence vector representation, observable is a two-dimensional matrix which can be ruined for more elements carrying noise. It is noted that our maximization operation is an element-wise operation over all word projectors, so the sentence observable carries the most important information of all words. This ablation study show than s that a suitable observable plays a vital role in feature extraction, similar to the cases of classical language models where better feature selection would produce higher model performance.",

However, when {|\u03c8 i } n i=1 are one-hot orthogonal basis, the density matrix reduces to a diagonal matrix with zero-valued off-diagonal elements, and this matrix corresponds to the probabilities of sememes in a classical case without sememes' superpositions. To explore the contribution of the superpositions in the density matrix, two comparative models are built, namely QEV-LM-class1 and QEV-LM-class2. Within QEV-LM-class1, the density matrix is diagonal and contains only 2n parameters instead of m \u00d7 2n. ( In QEV-LM, the density matrix \u03c1 = \u2211 m i=1 |v i v i | is formed by m\u00d7 complex-valued n-dimensional vectors.) In order to keep the same number of parameters, we build QEV-LM-class2 with each of the density matrix's n diagonal elements being the summation of other m parameters. Table 3 shows that the performance of QEV-LM-class1 and QEV-LM-class2 drops dramatically, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the superpositions. After the training process, all parameters {v i } m i=1 can be used to recover the density matrix as shown in Figure 3 . It is reasonable that the contribution from diagonal elements corresponding to the classical probabilities is dominant, but the off-diagonal elements' values are not neglectable. In conclusion, the sememes' superpositions contribute substantially to the model's performance. ",

In this subsection, we analyze the comparison of the explanation on each component of our model with that of other models, as shown in Table 5 . On the word encoder layer, QEV-LM and CNM encode words as complex-valued physical states, which are more similar to a real physical state in a quantum system. As for sentence representation, in many QLMs, a sentence is an information subspace of the quantum system, characterized by a specific density matrix. In those cases, the whole quantum system is divided into many subspaces, and the system itself which has a unique density matrix carrying a complete semantic information is lack of utilization. The similarity between different density matrices of subspaces is analyzed using mathematical methods such as VN-divergence. Especially, the convolutional layer used to extract density matrix's features in NNQLM-II is devoid of an analogous explanation in quantum probability theory. In our model, the whole quantum Hilbert space is not divided, and sentences are represented as quantum observables via word projector operators in the whole quantum system. Based on question's and answer's representation, a joint observable O qa can be constructed for each question-answer pair. Then, the unique density matrix of the system can be utilized to measure the probability, i.e., quantum expectation value, of this joint observable. Therefore, we end up with the physical interpretation that the matching score can be viewed as the quantum expectation value of the joint question-answer pair observable. ",

The question-answer matching score is naturally explained as the quantum expectation value of the joint question-answer observable. We apply our model on a typical answer selection task on standard benchmarking datasets, namely TREC-QA and WIKIQA. Experiment results on those datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed QEV-LM. Our model surpasses basic and typical CNN and LSTM baselines on both datasets and especially outperforms other quantum-inspired LMs with low time consumption.

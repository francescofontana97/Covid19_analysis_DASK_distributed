Consequently, the demands have increased and with it the risk for stress-related ill-health and absenteeism. The aim of the current study was to evaluate, in a larger sample of Swedish clergy (N = 871), two possible antecedents of burnout, namely prosocialness and relational-interdependent self-construal. A further aim was to explore potential gender differences in the investigated associations. The direct and indirect relationships of prosocialness and relational-interdependent self-construal to two dimensions of burnout, exhaustion, and disengagement were investigated in a structural equation-modelling framework. The results showed that clergy who reported higher prosocialness experienced more stress in their work, in terms of both quantitative and emotional demands, which in turn was associated with higher levels of exhaustion and disengagement. But prosocialness was also found to be directly associated with lower levels of disengagement, as well as indirectly associated with higher levels of role clarity. However, no direct or indirect associations were found between relational-interdependent self-construal and any dimension of burnout. Regarding gender differences, female clergy reported higher levels of prosocialness and job demands, less role clarity, and in turn more exhaustion compared to male clergy. This indicated a more stressful situation for female clergy. Our study contributes new insights into the role that personality plays in different dimensions of burnout in clergy, as well as insights into an understanding of gender differences in burnout among clergy.",

The profession not only entails the preaching of the gospel and the delivery of rituals, but also organization, administration, and pastoral care for people in need (e.g., Milstein et al. 2005 Milstein et al. , 2010 . Furthermore, providing spiritual guidance and pastoral care can be emotionally demanding and clergy are frequently approached to take on tasks typically performed by counsellors and mental health workers (e.g., Rudolfsson and Milstein 2019; Wang et al. 2003) . Consequently, the clergy profession has become more demanding and stressful (Hendron et al. 2012; Proeschold-Bell et al. 2015; Proeschold-Bell and Byassee 2018) , and it has been noted that emotional labour, role overload, and compassion fatigue are major clergy stressors (Adams et al. 2017; Frederick et al. 2018; Kinman et al. 2011) .",

In brief, prosocialness is the willingness to care for or assist others (Caprara et al. 2005 ), whereas relational-interdependent self-construal refers to the tendency to define oneself through one's social roles and relationships (Cross et al. 2000) . The relevance of attending to prosocialness and relation-interdependent self-construal is indicated by reports that clergy do not tend to differentiate between their personal lives and their professional role (Beebe 2007) , and that this strong identification with their professional role seems to be associated with less disengagement but higher exhaustion (Innstrand et al. 2011 ). Thus, prosocialness and a relational-interdependent self-construal may be associated with higher levels of strain and burnout among the clergy. Furthermore, because previous research has reported gender differences in burnout (e.g., Purvanova and Muros 2010) , where women often tend to report higher exhaustion and men tend to report higher disengagement, the study therefore also investigated if differences in prosocialness and relational-interdependent self-construal could form part of the explanation for commonly found gender differences in burnout.",

In recent decades, the Protestant Church of Sweden (Lutheran) has faced many challenges and undergone major changes. For instance, in 2000 the formal bond between the Swedish state and the Church of Sweden was ended, and since then its membership rate has been declining. However, the proportion of members in the population is still considerable (5.8 million members, or roughly 56% of the population) and the Church of Sweden continues to play a significant role in Swedish society (e.g., Kasselstrand 2015; Church of Sweden 2020). Moreover, the Church of Sweden has undergone various organizational changes. The number of parishes has decreased, as smaller parishes have been merged into larger parishes and congregations, which seems to have resulted in additional strain for clergy in terms of more administrative tasks and additional organizational responsibilities. Due to under-resourced public health services, clergy in Sweden, like clergy in other parts of the world, report being increasingly approached as free health care providers (Rudolfsson and Milstein 2019) . In parallel, concerns regarding the work environment and an increase in stressrelated ill-health and absenteeism have been reported among the Swedish clergy (e.g., Hansson 2006; Social Insurance Report 2014) . However, insights into possible antecedents to stress-related ill-health and burnout among Swedish clergy are limited and more research is needed.",

Initially, burnout was considered to be a psychological response to chronic stress expressed by people who work within human services professions (Maslach and Jackson 1981; Maslach 1992) . However, burnout is recognized as a possible response in all types of occupations, and the dimensionality of the concept has been the subject of extensive debates (e.g., Schaufeli et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, research suggests that the two core dimensions of burnout are exhaustion, referring to a depletion of mental and physical energy due to work-related strain and disengagement (c.f. depersonalization), characterized by feelings of cynicism toward one's work and one's clients (e.g., Qiao and Schaufeli 2011) .",

(2004) that personality is important to consider in understanding clergy burnout. Regarding the role of personality, clergy who report high neuroticism and low extraversion have been found to experience higher rates of burnout (e.g., Francis and Crea 2015; Turton and Francis 2007) . Francis and Crea (2015) proposed that extroverts are better prepared to meet the interpersonal expectations of the clergy profession. Moreover, in a study among clergy from several denominations, Beebe (2007) found that clergy who experienced less differentiation between the self and their profession, higher role overload, or higher role ambiguity, also reported higher indicators of risk of developing burnout. In a study of Methodist clergy, a high level of self-compassion was found to be associated with less exhaustion (Barnard and Curry 2012) . Nevertheless, as the previous research on the role of personality in relation to burnout among clergy is limited, more research is needed.",

Indeed, it has been suggested that clergy are at risk of burnout due to the human services aspects of their profession (e.g., Frederick et al. 2018) . Furthermore, it has been noted that the lower levels of disengagement observed among clergy may need to be understood in relation to their strong identification (e.g., religious identity, calling) with the job (Beebe 2007; Innstrand et al. 2011 ). Related to this, it has been suggested that people who have an altruistic motivation to work for the good of other people, and to serve the interests of a community (e.g., the church/ congregation), are better able to deal with stressors and stay engaged because of their prosocial motivation (Bakker 2015) .",

            "text": "Prosocialness is a trait-like disposition referring to the willingness to care for and be ready to help and assist others (Caprara and Pastorelli 1993; Caprara et al. 2005) . It has been reported that engaging in work-related prosocial behaviour increases the meaningfulness a person experiences in their work (Allan et al. 2018) , and prosocialness has been found to have a positive correlation with a person's general well-being (Caprara et al. 2005) . Nevertheless, being overly engaged in prosocial behaviour may increase stress and, in turn, risk having adverse effects on well-being (Windsor et al. 2008 ) and work-related outcomes (Bolino and Grant 2016) . Illustrative of this, some studies suggest that when people feel obliged to help others they may risk taking on too much responsibility for other people, which can lead to work overload and fatigue (e.g., Grant 2008; Bolino and Turnley 2005) . Furthermore, the relational-interdependent self-construal concept, which is related to prosocialness, refers to a person's identity in relation to their close relationships. People with higher relational-interdependent self-construal experience a close connection to others, in the sense that important relationships and social roles are an intimate and important part of their definition of self. To maintain and enhance a relational-interdependent self-construal, a person may engage in prosocial acts in order to enhance their relationships and connectedness with others (Cross et al. 2000) . Hence, it may be that individuals high in prosocialness-in a profession where the needs of the clients are great-will take on a greater workload and become more engaged in the emotional aspects of their work. Hence, clergy with higher prosocialness and relational-interdependent self-construal may be inclined to invest more time and effort in their work and are less likely to turn away clients in need, which in turn may blur the boundaries of their professional role. Similarly, these members of the clergy may become more involved and engaged in the needs of their family and friends, which also could have an impact on their work and their well-being (Netemeyer et al. 1996) .",

In their large meta-analyses, Purvanova and Muros (2010) noted that only a few studies have investigated the relationship between gender and burnout, and found that exhaustion was slightly more associated with women whereas disengagement was somewhat more associated with men. Gender effects are of interest in relation to burnout since the conditions under which men and women live are quite different (e.g., Matud 2004) , and because these conditions also differ in different occupations and societies (Purvanova and Muros 2010) . For example, a recent study from Sweden showed that victims of sexual abuse more frequently sought out female clergy for pastoral care as they seemed more approachable (Rudolfsson and Tidefors 2015) . This, together with the notion that clergy are being seen more frequently as potential mental health care providers (e.g., Rudolfsson and Milstein 2019) may mean an increased risk of more strain for female clergy.",

Overall, gender differences in prosocialness may be one factor that contributes to the gender differences in burnout statistics (Eurofound 2018) . Previous studies have found differences in the prosocial behaviour exhibited by men and women (Caprara et al. 2005; Diekman and Clark 2015) . Women tend to exhibit more empathy and offer more emotional support to others, especially in the context of close and longterm relationships. Moreover, women are also more willing to engage in efforts to help socially disadvantaged people, whereas men are more prone to engage in providing immediate assistance that demands concrete action. In line with this, women tend to report higher relational-interdependent self-construal (Cross and Madson 1997) . Furthermore, a study that investigated the role of empathy in relation to burnout among medical students found that women experienced more empathic concerns, as well as higher levels of personal distress and emotional exhaustion, compared to men (Paro et al. 2014) . Thus, gender differences in sociality in respect of burnout is an area that needs further exploration.",

The data analysed and reported in the current study came from the data collected in the first wave of a larger longitudinal (three-wave) study concerning individual differences in burnout among three occupational groups: clergy, teachers, and clinical psychologists. The research was approved by the Swedish National Board of Ethics (Reg. no. 608-17). In all, 2877 email addresses to clergy were collected from the Church of Sweden and these clergy were invited to participate in the study. To be eligible for participation, the clergyperson was to have worked for at least 1 year in their profession. A total of 897 (31%) of the clergy sample started the survey, and 851 (30%) completed the survey. We followed the recommendations of Newman (2014) and included all participants who had answered at least one relevant construct in the survey; thus seven persons were excluded since they failed to do so. Twelve persons were excluded because they had worked as a clergyperson for less than 1 year, and one additional person was excluded because they stated a job which indicated that the person was not a clergyperson. Since gender information was an important part of the investigations in the current study, four persons were excluded from the data analyses because they responded \"other\" to the gender question and because no statistically valid inferences can be drawn from such a small sample. In addition, two persons were excluded for not providing any gender information. Thus, the final sample consisted of 871 clergy (54% females) with a mean age of 49.4 years (SD = 9.89 years). The majority worked full time (92%) and had the job title of curate (57%), which is the most common job title for clergy working within the Church of Sweden. Furthermore, 43% of the clergy reported that they had a managerial position. The sample was considered highly representative for clergy working for the Church of Sweden, even though slightly more women participated in this study, since 49% of the clergy serving in the Church of Sweden are female according to information provided by the Church of Sweden's employer organization. Also, the mean age in the current study was marginally lower than that of the working population of clergy in the Church of Sweden (52 years).",

For example, the association between prosocialness and role clarity may be different for male and female clergy in such a way that it may be negative for one group while positive for the other; or the association might be stronger for one group, such that an increase in prosociality for female clergy has a larger impact on role clarity than for male clergy. If these types of differences were found, it would mean that the paths in the latent structure model (Fig. 1 ) differed significantly for female and male clergy.

However, one in five clergy (20%) in our sample reported clinical levels of exhaustion. This is a rather high proportion, since only 13.5% in a normal working population have reported similar levels of exhaustion (Lundgren-Nilsson et al. 2012) . The high levels of emotional and quantitative demands, as well as the low levels of role clarity, may form part of the explanation for the higher proportion of clinical reports of exhaustion in our sample.",

Prosocialness was associated with higher reported levels of quantitative demands and, in particular, higher levels of emotional demands. This provides support for the notion that higher levels of prosocialness contribute to higher engagement with the needs of clients (Bakker 2015) -needs that often are highly emotional in nature (Hendron et al. 2012) . Given the result that reported quantitative demands and emotional demands were associated with exhaustion, prosocialness may be a key factor in order to understand why some clergy experience more exhaustion than others. In contrast, no significant relationships were found between relational-interdependent self-construal and the different job demands in the model. When controlling for prosocialness, it appears that interdependent-relational selfconstrual instead taps into a dispositional view of the self that seems to be mainly unrelated to the other study constructs. It should also be noted that the correlation between prosocialness and relational-interdependent self-construal was rather small, considering the apparent theoretical closeness of the two constructs. This suggests therefore that relational-interdependent self-construal and prosocialness are not as closely related as has been previously suggested (Cross et al. 2000) .",

This indicates that clergy with higher prosocialness experience a clearer perception of the boundaries and goals of their work role. In turn, this may help to explain the negative relationship between prosocialness and disengagement in our results (Hypothesis 2), and is in line with reports from experimental studies showing that work-related prosocial activities increase the meaningfulness of one's work (Allan et al. 2018) . However, less disengagement might not be exclusively beneficial. To illustrate, if a clergyperson experiences high job demands, then disengagement may act as an alarm bell that reminds him or her that they need to disengage from their work in order to allow for wellneeded recovery periods. In brief, prosocialness seems to both contribute to and mitigate against burnout. It may increase experienced quantitative demands and emotional demands and this may increase exhaustion. However, prosocialness also appears to be directly associated with decreased disengagement and with increased role clarity, which was also found to be related to decreased disengagement. In order to utilize the positive effects and mitigate the negative effects of prosocialness on burnout, interventions which aim to increase awareness of the different potential effects of prosocialness should be developed for clergy in danger of burnout. Such interventions might be to discuss in order to clarify what would be reasonable boundaries and the content of the professional role of the clergy. Having clear boundaries may help clergy to not over-engage with their clients and in turn may decrease their perceived workload.",

Secondly, as measured in the present study, the personal-to-work conflict items can assess if any type of personal life matter is an obstacle to a person's effectiveness at work.

However, although female clergy on average reported higher levels of prosocialness and quantitative demands as well as lower levels of role clarity compared to their male colleagues, the gender differences were quite small. The largest gender difference was found for the reported levels of emotional demands. While further research is needed to understand why female clergy experience higher levels of emotional demands than their male colleagues do, it could be that female clergy are more often contacted by parishioners in need. In support of this, a study by Rudolfsson and Tidefors (2015) found that individuals who had suffered from sexual abuse expressed that they would rather seek out female clergy as providers of pastoral care, as they were seen as less threatening and easier to confide in. However, the results of our study also highlight another possible explanation for the gender differences in exhaustion that have been reported in the literature (e.g., Purvanova and Muros 2010) . Our results show an association between having a managerial position and lower levels of exhaustion. Thus, it seems that the gender differences in exhaustion may, in part, be explained by the fact that female clergy hold managerial positions less frequently than their male colleagues do. But the difference may also be explained partly by the fact that female clergy have worked fewer years than their male colleagues, since the more years the clergyperson had worked, the less exhaustion they reported and the older the clergyperson, the less disengagement they reported. Nonetheless, although the gender difference in the mean levels of exhaustion was rather small, the observed difference is in line with what has been reported in previous research among clergy (Innstrand et al. 2011) .",

Another interesting topic would be to investigate the differences in the tasks performed by female and male clergy.

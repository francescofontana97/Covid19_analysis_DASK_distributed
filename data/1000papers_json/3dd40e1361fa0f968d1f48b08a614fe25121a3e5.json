Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or immunocompromise. Participants underwent venipuncture to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Samples were tested with a chemiluminescent immunoassay for IgG antibodies to the nucleocapsid antigen (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG). Positives were confirmed by testing with a different chemiluminescent immunoassay for IgG antibodies to the S1/S2 spike antigens (Diasorin LIAISON\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG). Both assays have excellent test characteristics. Out of 360 ED patient care staff, 139 study participants were included: 90 (64.7%) female, 88 (63.3%) white, with a median age of 36 (IQR 27-61) years. 126/139 (90.6%)",

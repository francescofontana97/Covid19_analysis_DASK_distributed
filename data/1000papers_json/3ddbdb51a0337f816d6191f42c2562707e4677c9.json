Therefore, this study aimed to describe and evaluate nursing students' experiences of the pedagogical transition from traditional campus based learning to distance learning using digital tools. Methods: The nursing course Symptom and signs of illness underwent a transition from campus based education to distance learning using digital tools because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This pedagogical transition in teaching was evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative data analysis. Focus group interviews (n = 9) were analysed using qualitative content analysis to explore students' experiences of the pedagogical transition and to construct a web-based questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised 14 items, including two open-ended questions. The questionnaire was delivered to all course participants and responses were obtained from 96 of 132 students (73%). Questionnaire data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and comments from the open-ended questions were used as quotes to highlight the quantitative data. Results: The analysis of the focus group interviews extracted three main dimensions: didactic aspects of digital teaching, study environment, and students' own resources. Social interaction was an overall theme included in all three dimensions. Data from the questionnaire showed that a majority of students preferred campus based education and experienced deterioration in all investigated dimensions after the pedagogical transition. However, approximately one-third of the students appeared to prefer distance learning using digital tools.",

In general, students participating in nursing program are approximately 90% female and the vast majority are between 20 and 30 years old, these demographics were also observed in present study. The second semester in the Gothenburg University nursing program includes three courses, starting with a 3-week course on microbiology. The second course is an 11-week course called Symptom and signs of illness (16.5 ECTS), which focuses on a range of common diagnoses and the pathology, symptoms and signs, treatment, and nursing related to each diagnoses. The semester ends with a 6-week pharmacology course. When students were in the fifth week of the second course (Symptom and signs of illness), the COVID-19 outbreak resulted in the pedagogical transition from traditional campus based lectures to distance learning using digital tools. Originally, this course consisted of several campus based lectures, oral examinations, a written examination, practical training on campus, and 3 weeks of clinical practice. As of the fifth week of this course, students had experienced approximately half of the campus based lectures, two oral examinations, and campus based practical training. Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, the transition from traditional campus based learning to distance learning using digital tools was rapid. The lecturers scheduled for teaching were informed about the change to distance learning using digital tools, but some external lecturers were not familiar with using digital tools as a teaching method. The lecturers had to decide if they had the capability to transition to teaching using digitals tool and prepare the new learning activities within 3 weeks. Some teachers readily adapted to this change, some had more difficulty adapting, and some declined because of an increased clinical burden.",

The second form was pre-recorded video lectures. These lectures were created using Power Point (Microsoft, Redmond, USA), and included the teacher's narration of the slide show. Some teachers also included animation highlights to emphasize specific aspects in the slide show. The third form of learning activity was self-study using the course literature and lecture slide shows without direct participation of the teacher. The self-study category was primarily to accommodate the lectures that were canceled by clinicians that had to prioritize clinical work due to the COVID-19 situation.",

An interview guide was developed using open-ended questions; for example: \"How did you experience the transition from traditional to distance education\" and \"Have the changes affected your commitment to your studies?\" Follow up questions were asked, such as \"What has it meant for you?\" These questions aimed to elicit deeper narratives where the students reflected on educational aspects and what the pedagogical transition had meant for them. The focus group proceedings were audiotaped and transcribed. In addition, notes were taken during the interviews to capture participants' non-verbal expressions.

The importance of social interaction is not a new concept in teaching. This theory was first developed by Vygotskij [19] , and introduced in Europe in 1960 as sociocultural educational theory. According to this theory, human development depends more on a person's interaction with their environment and other individuals than on a personal process. Vygotskij argued that there is a difference between what a person learns on their own and what that person learns through interaction with others. Depending on the context in which learning occurs, a person can be either at their actual level of development or at their potential level of development. The actual level of development refers to when a person learns something by their own power, and the potential level of development is when learning opportunities increase through interactions with others with more knowledge and experience [19, 20] . The need for social interaction in distance education is evident, and poses a major challenge for teachers to create learning activities that support social interaction. For example, digital group assignments, digital group discussions, or group chats may be good ways to increase students' social interaction in the digital environment and enable students to reach their potential level of development.",

Digital tools in education are important because they may facilitate learning and also because they change how we learn [21] . S\u00e4lj\u00f6 [21] argued that fitting digital tools into an established way of teaching may create suboptimal learning conditions. In the present study, students were not always satisfied with the digital learning activities and reported difficulty finding and understanding the information that was communicated through the digital learning platform. Therefore, the results of this study emphasized the importance of adapted learning activities, clear instructions, and a visible course structure when using digital tools. These results are in line with Delgaty [22] , who discussed the importance of clear guidance surrounding strategies to support changes in distance learning. The rapid transition in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic forced educators to incorporate digital tools in a course planed for traditional campus based teaching. A longer preparation time for the pedagogical transition to digital tools might have resulted in more positive experiences of distance learning. It is the teacher's responsibility to include a clear structure when designing learning activities that does not leave students Fig. 5 Results relating to the student's own resources dimension during distance teaching using digital tools. Changes experienced by the students after the implementation of distance teaching using digital tools in relation to study motivation (a), study discipline (b), and students' own responsibility (c). Data are based on 96 responses and presented as percentages on their own in their learning process [17, 23] . This statement was echoed in a recent publication by Porter et al. [24] that described the academic experiences of transitioning to blended online learning, and highlighted the importance of teachers' preparation and planning in the pedagogical transition to distance learning using digital tools. Adapting learning activities to a digital environment and improving practical information about the course and the course structure are key components in creating successful distance learning.",

In this study, students preferred pre-recorded video lectures to electronic live lectures or study on their own. The preference for electronic live lectures might have been reduced because of technical problems with this form of learning activity. The students reported that the major benefits with pre-recorded video lectures were that they could be completed at any time, at their own pace, and viewed multiple times. However, it remains unclear whether students learn best through prerecorded video lectures; further studies are needed to answer such questions.",

Consistent with this finding, Walsh [18] showed that reduced social interaction had a negative effect on nursing students' mental health. In a university environment, emphasis is placed on individual achievement, but students clearly stated the importance of social processes in how they coped with the demands of higher education [18] . Our findings and previous research support the idea that teachers need to develop didactic strategies that compensate for the lack of social interaction to improve the psychosocial study environment in distance learning. This is especially important as educators have limited potential to influence the physical study environment during distance teaching.",

Transition from campus based learning to distance learning placed more responsibility on students' capacity to adapt to changes associated with this transition. Salmon [23] claimed that students need to develop new skills to manage information and knowledge obtained in a digital learning environment. We suggest that teachers may need to take a more active role in improving digital literacy to reduce the number of students struggling with the technical aspects of the digital tools. If students have difficulty adapting to these changes and the new study environment in addition to academic requirements, it may result in decreased motivation and high occurrences of issues such as anxiety, dissatisfaction, stress and social isolation [26] . In addition, Nilsson et al. [27] highlighted the need for educational organizations to maintain students' motivation, which may be more important in a digital setting than a traditional setting. Further, a decrease in social interaction may lead to social isolation, which may also affect students' motivation. Students need to maintain their motivation without the constant interaction that campus based learning offers, and must be disciplined to meet the course requirements, although study discipline may be difficult for teachers to influence. By creating tasks and assignments that stimulate students to interact with each other or with teachers, students' motivation may be improved and social isolation prevented [17] . Blended teaching methods have been suggested as an effective method to reach students with low motivation [28] . This also accords with previous research by Jowsey et al. [29] which suggests that when blended learning is delivered purposefully and effectively in terms of managing and supporting student active learning, it positively influences the achievements of students.",

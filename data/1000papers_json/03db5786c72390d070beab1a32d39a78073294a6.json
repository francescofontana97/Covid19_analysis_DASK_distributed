Since peer-reviewed research is a trusted source of evidence, capturing and predicting the emerging themes in COVID-19 literature are crucial for guiding research and policy. Machine learning, natural language processing and dynamical networks have the potential to enable rapid distillation and prediction of actionable insights for ending the pandemic. Objective. We hypothesized that emerging COVID-19 research trends can be captured and predicted from networks constructed upon language features. Further, we aimed to detect communities in these networks and used centrality measures to track and predict emerging network modules as dominant themes in a given time period. The goal of our study was to make our findings publicly available as an explainable AI dashboard for researchers and policymakers. Methods. Abstracts from more than 95,000 peer-reviewed articles from the WHO curated COVID-19 database were used to construct word embedding models. Named entity recognition was used to refine the terms. Cosine similarity between the terms was then used to construct dynamical networks in order to understand the temporal trend of emerging associations over months and visualized as alluvial diagrams. Finally, temporal link prediction between diseases for the subsequent month based on their trends of occurrence in the previous six months was carried out to predict the emergence and disappearance of associations in the rapidly changing pandemic scenario. Results. Community detection upon dynamical networks clearly demonstrated the emergence of thromboembolic complications as a cluster and dominant theme between March and August, 2020. Forecasting of top-K influential entities further allowed prediction of future trends, such as the emergence of psychiatry theme as a central node by February 2021. XGBoost modeling in our proposed temporal link prediction framework achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.855 for predicting new dis(associations) one month in advance. Visualization of the underlying word-embedding models allowed interactive querying to choose novel keywords and extractive models summarized the research relevant to the keyword, allowing faster knowledge distillation. Conclusion: We provide an explainable AI approach for querying, tracking and predicting novel insights in COVID-19 peer reviewed literature. The EvidenceFlow web-application is publicly available and emerging trends are updated on a monthly basis. Such approaches will",

More than 200 countries have been affected by the pandemic with around 75 million confirmed cases and more than 1.6 million deaths recorded till 22nd December 2020 [1] . The literature around COVID-19 is growing at a similar pace with more than 95,000 research articles peer-reviewed articles made publicly available by the WHO [2]. Knowledge synthesis from peer-reviewed literature will become increasingly difficult for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers alike. Hence understanding COVID-19 in the context of evolving themes is important. Ebadi et al [3] carried out topic modeling and sentiment analysis comparing pre-print with peer reviewed literature over a short time span from January to May 2020. However, we are reporting for the first time, the use of unsupervised word embeddings, networks analysis, link prediction and machine learning to predict emerging themes in COVID-19 literature and making these publicly available as a web-application. The current model is trained upon the 95,000 peer-reviewed articles obtained from the WHO Database and will be updated with new publications and pre-prints as these become available on a monthly basis.",

Link Prediction has been defined as the task of predicting the existence of links between two nodes in a complex network based on a set of topological features. The problem of link prediction in real-world temporal networks has been explored a lot in recent years, primarily in online social media networks where nodes are represented by users and edges by the relationship between them. Bu et al [5] proposed a novel semi-supervised learning framework, which integrates survival analysis and game theory for predicting future links. Peddada et al [6] explored the problem of link prediction using supervised learning methods based on proximity scores to capture the temporal shift. In this paper, we propose a framework to predict reconnected and missing links between clinical entities such as diseases extracted from textual data over T time intervals, using a set of proximity scores derived from associated dynamic networks and word embedding similarity. The co-occurrence of words in a span of text plays a vital role in capturing a high-level semantic relationship. Hence, we label the links based on co-occurrence analysis between entity pairs. Given the vast research found on online social networks, our framework differs from the standard link prediction models as it studies the concept by is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

Nine proximity scores based upon network topology were computed using the NetworkX package [15] and a first order difference of these series were taken in order to capture temporal trends. These were further normalized and used as features for predicting the existence of a link at +1 using Random Forests [23] , SVM [24] , AdaBoost [25] , XGBoost [26] , and LGBM [27] models and the best model for link prediction based on AUC ROC scores was used to predict the subsequent links.

A detailed inference of the alluvial diagram across the month of March and August depicted the emergence of thromboembolic complications as the most important module. In March, the dominant modules were lymphocytopenia, chest pain and acute kidney injury, depicting lesser traces of thromboembolic complications in initial months. The network of August evidently captures the rising influence of nodes linked to thromboembolism, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Our study depicts how word embeddings generated from Word2Vec model trained on each month's literature can support the creation of entity networks. The importance of a node is influenced by its topological position and centrality measures along with Pagerank.

Vaccine, which has been a rising topic lately, had the highest cosine similarity with Ad26.COV2.S (also known as Ad26) and mRNA-1273, which are few of the most discussed candidate vaccines for COVID19 in the literature. 'Comorbidity' is found to have a high similarity with hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, heart as well as kidney diseases. A number of long-term effects have been reported post recovery due to a weakened immune system. Exploring 'adverse effects' as a keyword depicted correlations with cardiac adverse events, maladaptive anxiety and humoral immunodeficiency. People with dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms have been affected adversely as well. 'Social' factors were found to have the highest similarity with connectedness and an increase in family violence and psychological damage. It also highlights the existing gap between rural and urban communities. The economic recession caused by the pandemic has also led to loneliness and social anxiety which was captured by the language models as well. 'Psychological' health has been negatively impacted due to worry and stress over the coronavirus, which is characterized by aggravation of conditions such as PTSD and an intuitively high cosine similarity with 'eating disorder'. Hence, Natural Language Processing techniques were effectively used to capture latent associations among general keywords and named entities. Detailed descriptions of the analysis can be found in the supplementary Exploring the evolution of literature based on themes helps reveal insightful trends using Natural Language Processing. In recent years, many methods have been put forward to predict centrality in dynamic networks on the basis of past values [4] . Forecasting top-K influential entities based on centrality measures can also assist in steering research while understanding the temporal dynamics of themes represented by them. The method presented in this paper has provided a novel approach for identifying critical nodes in entity networks weighted by cosine similarity, and can be extended to various other dynamical analyses such as the impact of entities on expanding dynamic knowledge graphs.",

'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease' has been predicted to show links with 'pneumonia' and 'death'. The links represent the frequent co-occurrence of entities at the given timestamp based on networks of previous months. The Papers mentioned are from October and they represent the validation of our model's temporal link prediction as their abstracts talk about the given two entities, hence verifying the concept of co-occurrence.

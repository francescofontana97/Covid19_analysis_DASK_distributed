In our country, the increasing life expectancy (80.5 for males and 84.9 for females, with a total life expectancy of 82.9) has led to very positive consequences for health and the well-being of elderly people: a very high number of older adults lives and acts independently in their daily life, even if they have one or more than one chronic disease. In the time of COVID-19 s outbreak in Italy, the focus of the media was on elderly people for two main reasons. First, many older people demonstrated a very high civic sense and they were helping society to fight against the pandemic. Second, also in Italy, like in China, the older adults are at higher risk in being infected with COVID-19 and if they get ill, they have a higher risk of death. The balance previously achieved between age-related disorders and a good quality of life and good health is now under high pressure. It is very important to protect elderly people from infection, but also it is important to respect them and to support them in this complex situation. There is a great risk of \"ageism\". In agreement with Lloyd-Sherlock and colleagues (2020), in this editorial we propose some hints of analysis, starting from the ongoing experience in Italy.",

These women and men represent a very important reference for their social, economic and cultural roles in the society. They are caregivers for grandchildren and they give economic support for unemployed younger people or with precarious jobs. Additionally, they are the historical memory of our country. Due to the increasing of life expectancy, together with the spread of healthy lifestyles, in Italy we have elderly people that seem younger than they are, and they are in very good health condition [2] .",

First, many older people demonstrated a very civic sense and they were helping society to fight against the pandemic: \"retired physicians and nurses\" came back to work, \"retired scientists and researchers\" came back to work and other people helped communities in different ways (also preparing sanitary tools for protection against infection, like protective masks and disposable gowns). In the emergency, old Italian adults show a great ability to cope and help communities, even in the risk of infection for them and for their families. From previous research, we know that in Italy there are about 4 million old adults that are retired from work for age-related reasons and according to the actual laws on retirement, but they'd like to work and to have an active role in the productive system. Additionally, it is important to remember that people who are currently eighty and ninety are those who experienced the Second World War and the subsequent \"economic boom\". In the past, they learned how to cope with a difficult situation and to develop a sort of a \"post-traumatic growth\" and now they are demonstrating it with high civic sense.",

            "text": "Again, in agreement with Lloyd-Sherlock and colleagues [10] , we highlight the importance of international and national attention to old adults, during the outbreak of COVID-19. We believe that, even in complex situations, awareness of different aspects of a situation is the first step. Then it is necessary to take all aspects into account [14, 15] . From an international point of view, the World Health Organization has produced some guidelines, with a focus on elderly people and people with disabilities [10, 11] . From a national perspective, the government, scientific societies, stakeholders and health policy makers have a central role in planning and implementing a specific intervention for old adults. We believe that the second step is an approach based on planning and action: international organizations and committee, stakeholders, health policy makers and clinicians should collaborate with communities, social workers and self-advocacy associations to support old adults to overcome the outbreak. Additionally, we also highlight the importance of a long-term perspective of supporting old adults over the course of the outbreak of COVID-19 and all the future phases of the pandemic. We need to look also to the future and to schedule the progressive reduction of restrictions and of the lockdown. Additionally, we need to look further and toward the \"reconstruction\" after the emergency. In each phase, a person-centered and age-friendly approach is needed. Last but not least, learning from ongoing experience and the significant role played by the so-called \"retired\" people in facing the emergency, a new approach to age is needed. The main question is: considering the important role that old adults are playing now in the emergency, what could be their \"new role\" in the near future? In the next phase of \"reconstruction\", what role is there for ageing people in a time where there will be a great need of the efforts of each person? From this point of view, we have a great opportunity to learn from the difficulties and to capitalize the great civic efforts of \"active elderly\" during the outbreak.",

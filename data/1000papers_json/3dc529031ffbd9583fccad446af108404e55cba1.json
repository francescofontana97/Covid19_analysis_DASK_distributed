It has been shown that worse outcomes may be more prevalent in hypertensive and diabetic patients, possibly due to overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors in alveolar epithelial cells. Some researchers speculate that as using ACEIs and ARBs upregulate ACE-2 expression, theoretically this effect could increase the virus entry and risk for COVID-19 or disease severity. In contrast, some investigators have postulated some mechanisms for the beneficial effects of these drugs. To exemplify, upregulating ACE2 with ACEI or ARBs could enhance the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 which has anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory properties. Nevertheless, professional societies such as ACC/ AHA have recommended that patients receiving these drugs should continue taking them. 3, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] Decision-making under uncertainty would be stressful in such settings. However, we decided to continue the ACEI because we postulated that stopping the drug in a compensated heart failure patient might be more harmful. 3, 14, 15 Another issue regarding the current patient is the development of non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) after controlling his pneumonitis. As shown earlier, the endothelial dysfunction in the setting of coronavirus infection may lead to the plaque instability, microvascular dysfunction, and thrombus formation in previously diseased coronary arteries. On the other hand, prolonged hypoxemia in this patient could be considered a predisposing factor for MI development.",

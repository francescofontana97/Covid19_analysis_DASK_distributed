Regression results show that editors from top-ranked journals are less likely to agree with common disciplinary critiques, more likely to support market solutions and less likely to agree with concerns about editorial practices.",

Tenure and promotion outcomes often depend heavily on the decisions of editors and reviewers. 1 Advancement in the profession also depends on citations, and evidence in indicates that reviewer recommendations are strong determinants of citations and that editorial decisions are closely linked to reviewer recommendations. Moreover, these decisions play a critical role in the evolution of disciplinary communities, signaling recent developments, establishing boundaries of disciplinary conversation, and shaping which views are perceptually salient, seemingly relevant and forceful (Szenberg and Ramrattan 2014) .",

            "text": "While publishing in economics is no different than other disciplines in its impact on faculty careers, there is growing recognition that an important element of publishing in economics lies in the impact of economic theorizing on policy and practice. This nexus between academic output and real-world outcomes was made particularly salient as the profession began to re-examine its role in the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The profession was criticized not only for its failure to predict the crisis, but also for its blindness to the potential for such catastrophic market failures. Leading economists argued that the discipline was hampered by its penchant for high-level mathematics and devotion to free markets. As Paul Krugman put it, \"the economics profession went astray because economists, as a group, mistook beauty clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth\" (Krugman 2009 ). More recently, the news that Paul R. Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson won the 2020 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, led to mixed reviews. Critics decried the Nobel committee for sticking to convention in recognizing auction theory instead of research on a topic like inequality or diversity at a time when the lowest-income households and socially marginalized groups around the globe have borne the brunt of the economic crisis that is accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 As the profession re-examines its role in shaping the contours of economics, we look to the \"gatekeepers\" to examine their views on some contested issues. It is clear that the journal editor plays a pivotal role as gatekeeper in the review process and that there are a relatively small number of individuals who serve in this function. As of 2019-2020, the AAUP reports a total of 847 degree-granting institutions in the US. Of those institutions, 227 are doctoral awarding. In economics, there are a total of 2,882 academic economists in PhD granting economics departments as of 2019. The Journal Citation Reports (JCR) identifies roughly 373 academic journals in economics with Article Influence Scores. 3 Yet, the reality of publishing in economics is more exclusive than even these figures suggest.",

Tommaso Colussi (2018) points out that about 43 percent of articles in the leading general-interest journals published from 2000 to 2006 were written by authors connected to editors having either worked at the same institution, received their PhD from the same institution, coauthored together, or (in the case of editors) having served as an advisor to an author. Colussi found that 25 percent of authors held appointments in six US universities at the time of publication and the same institutions that also employed 56 percent of the editors. Hence, a relatively small number of editors from a small number of institutions play an influential role in editing journals in the discipline and influencing the careers of hopeful economists. In this analysis, we aim to better understand the views of editors on a number of key issues in the editorial process in economics, and we examine if there are differences in these views based upon the status of the journal and the country affiliation of the editor (US vs. non-US).",

In this study, we examine the views of economists serving as editors, co-editors, and associate editors of economics journals on these seemingly thorny but important issues.",

At the same time, Solow acerbically writes that \"A thousand flowers can bloom without all blooming in the same journal. \" 6 Finally, with the hegemony of the top journals comes concern about issues of prestige and status and its impact on the discipline. 7 We seek to better understand the views of editors on various questions where status considerations may appear, such as the importance of having editorial board members, authors, and reviewers from prestigious universities. While these are not the only areas where status and prestige may inject themselves in the editorial process, they are areas where the views of editors may be especially important.",

The AIS uses citations to assess and track the influence of a journal in relation to other journals, and it determines the average influence of a journal's articles over the first five years after publication. 9 In total, there were 314 journals on the JCR list of economics journals that had an AIS reported for them.

            "text": "We identified a total of 4906 editors, co-editors, and associate editors in this complete set of journals, with some individuals appearing more than once since it is not uncommon for people to hold multiple editorial positions. In this full population of economics journal editors, there were approximately 3,000 uniquely identified men and 450 uniquely identified women whose essential information was not missing. Thus, of all the individual economics editors, we were able to identify, about 14 percent were women. We then selected a sample of 414 women and a random sample of 421 men for a total sample size of 835. For each person who served in more than one editorial position, we randomly selected one journal from those they served as lead editor or co-editor; if all their positions were associate editor positions, we randomly selected one journal from those for which they served as associate editors. Finally, we sent a unique link via email to each of the 835 individuals in the sample that invited the individual in their role as editor of their assigned economics journal to participate in the survey. In total, 247 individuals completed the survey (124 men and 123 women), for an overall response rate of about 30 percent. 11 We over-sampled women and lead editors and co-editors to provide a more uniform distribution of conditioning characteristics in the sample of responding editors and to increase the likelihood that all types of editors would be represented. This strategy also ensures that our sample has sufficient numbers of responses from editors of each type for the methodology to have adequate statistical power so that we can distinguish an actual effect from one that occurs by chance. Over-sampling lead editors and co-editors also makes sense given that they typically have greater decision power in the editorial process than associate editors . 10 The role of editors who make up an editorial team varies among journals. While editors are typically responsible for \"desk-reject\" decisions, depending on how the journal is managed, the editor may make all decisions regarding which articles to accept or reject or may assign an article to an associate or assistant editor. Because of the growing use of associate editors and their involvement in the review process, we survey editors, co-editors, and associate editors. In our ordered probit estimations, we include associate editors as a separate control group to identify how their views differ from those of editors and co-editors. 11 Response rates in economic surveys include 35.4% in May et al. (2014) ; 34.4% in Alston et al. (1992) ; 30.8% in Fuller and Geide-Stevenson (2003) , and 26.6% in Klein and Stern (2005) . Our data contain 247 sample observations on the responding editors' coded responses to 17 survey questions and binary indicators of the responding editors' conditioning characteristics: US affiliation, PhD in 2000 or later, journal AIS in upper quartile, associate editor, and female. We use the marginal distribution of responses to describe the overall views of editors and we use the conditional distribution of responses to describe the relationships between editors' views and editors' characteristics. Sample means are reported in Table 2 , where the first column weights the observations to correct for over-sampling women and lead/co-editors. The weights ensure that the (joint) distribution of men and women editors and associate editors (female, associate editor) in the population-weighted sample is the same as in the population of editors. The remaining columns describe the characteristics of the responding editors (all editors, lead/co-editors, and associate editors).",

About half of all editors are affiliated with US institutions, but the US representation is about 10 percentage points higher among lead editors and co-editors than it is for associate editors. About 30 percent of all editors earned their PhD's in 2000 or after. This percentage is lower for lead editors and co-editors than it is for associate editors, which would be expected given the expectation that lead and co-editors have more seniority and experience. Moreover, about one third of respondents serve journals that are ranked in the top quartile of the AIS ranking. Strikingly, only 14 percent of all editors in the population-weighted sample are women, and of those women, a slightly higher percentage of women are associate editors than lead editors or co-editors.

Using the weighted responses correct these estimates for any non-response bias that might arise if men and women or lead/co-editors have different views on the survey topics and also have different rates of response to the survey. 13 The entropy parameter (\u03c1) simply combines the five possible responses to each survey question (from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) into one number ranging from zero (complete consensus) to one (complete lack of consensus). 14 The maximum possible 12 Note that a few questions were answered on a slightly different scale in which 1=not at all important and 5=extremely important, as shown in our tables. Discussion of results is based on (disagree/agree) unless otherwise noted in the text. 13 If editors' opinions and their decisions to respond are independent after controlling for their editorial position and their sex, then the percentage distributions of the weighted responses in Table 3 are unbiased estimates of the population distributions of all editors. 14 Following the procedure described in Frey et al. (1984) and Block and Walker (1988) , the standardized relative entropy (\u03c1) is defined as the actual entropy for each question divided by the maximum possible entropy over the possible responses for each question. Actual entropy is the sum over the response entropy for each question would occur if all responses were evenly divided over the possible responses, representing a complete lack of consensus. Consistent with the meaning of the word entropy, an increase in \u03c1 represents a move from agreement to a state of disagreement. This measure of relative entropy is widely used in the social sciences to indicate the evenness of similarity (Proops 1987) .",

The probit estimates will be free from non-response bias even if editors' views and response rates are correlated, as long as the correlation is due solely to their common dependence on the conditioning variables. 15 The estimated marginal effect of a particular editor characteristic (for example, US versus non-US affiliation) on the probability of response to the survey question provides a measure of the difference in views between the two types of editors. We calculate the predicted difference in the probability of agreement (survey responses 4 or 5) between the two types and the predicted difference in the probability of disagreement (survey responses 1 or 2). 16 In our discussion of the results, we report the variables or group characteristics that have the largest impact on opinions for a particular question.",

We begin by assessing editor's acknowledgement that they play an important role in defining the boundaries of the discipline. This question provides a baseline of agreement and also shows the degree to which editors believe that their actions as editors play an important role in shaping the boundaries of the discipline. Here we see that editors' views reflect a great deal of consensus on the important role that they play in defining the boundaries of the discipline. A large proportion of editors (81 percent) agree or strongly agree with the statement \"Editors play an important role in defining the boundaries of a discipline.\" On a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), the average response for this question is 4.0, and the relative entropy score of .66 is the lowest among all other questions in each of the three categories examined, which indicates that there is relatively more consensus with this statement than the other statements.",

Editors are in general concerned about issues related to the editorial process (the presence of one reviewer, or a biased referee), but these concerns seem to be less important for editors of top tier journals. In particular, there is general agreement that a single reviewer is not particularly appropriate and that editors should avoid sending manuscripts to reviewers with a known bias either for or against a paper. Editors of top-ranked journals are less likely to see a problem associated with having only one reviewer, which could be because the top journals have a higher bar in the referee process and may only need one negative referee to reject a paper. Moreover, editors are not persuaded by the value of doubleblind reviews as a mechanism for reducing bias. This skepticism most likely reflects the view that there is no such thing as a truly blind review given the prevalence of working papers drafts being available online (Pontille and Torny 2014) . Overall, editors of top-ranked journals are less likely to view as problematic some of the editorial practices that our survey addressed. Much of this is probably explained by growing pressures at the top journals from publishers and from the professional associations for citations and faster turnaround times, which may in turn pressure editors to prioritize expediency over fairness. There is more pressure than ever for economics journals to shorten their time to decision, especially in light of the relatively fast turnaround times at many science journals where increasing numbers of economists are publishing. This sort of pressure is likely to be greater at the level of the top journals than other journals since more money is at stake and there is more to lose from top-ranked authors choosing to submit elsewhere.",

Editors with a US affiliation are even less likely than editors outside the US to place a high weight on the reviewer's status. With the proliferation of journals and growing demands on economists' time, editors are likely to place relatively less weight on the status of reviewers because it has become increasingly difficult to find highly-published reviewers who are willing and able to serve as reviewers. To explore this assertion, we examined journal statistics on time to decision and found that journals with US-based editors take slightly longer in terms of their average time to decision than journals with editors outside of the US. 24 Assuming that finding willing reviewers is one of the determinants of longer decision times, this would explain why US-based journals place relatively less emphasis on reviewer status.",

Economics has long been criticized for exhibiting a narrow methodological approach that favors theoretical modeling over empirical testing using real-world data. As Klamer and Colander reported in their landmark study The Making of an Economist, only 3 percent of graduate students in top US programs saw \"having a thorough knowledge of the economy\" as important for their academic success in economics while 57 percent believed that \"excellence in mathematics\" was very important for success in their career (Klamer and Colander 1990, p. 18); Blaug 1997; Snowdon and Vane 1999) . This critique of economics and its penchant for producing \"idiot savants\" prompted the AEA in 1988 to establish a Commission on Graduate Education in Economics, but their findings did little to quell concerns which continue to be expressed by Nobel Laureates on the left, and right, and in the middle of the ideological spectrum. 25 Results further indicate that editors in general have little use for such critiques. They don't share the view that \"mathiness\" is a problem in the discipline and don't share the notion that economics relies too much on theoretical modeling. Editors of the top-ranked journals tend to disagree more than the rest that mathiness is a problem. This finding is consistent with results in Bigo and Negru (2014) showing that economists approve of the emphasis on mathematics in the profession and if anything, they favor increasing the rigor of mathematical models rather than reducing the emphasis on math.",

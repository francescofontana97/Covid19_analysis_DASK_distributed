Theoretically, these therapeutic modalities enable the restoration of T-cell cytotoxicity, thus potentiating enhanced antiviral effects. However, immunopathological findings of COVID-19 are characterized by significant inflammatory damage, especially during the late period of disease, which may be worsened by ICI treatment. Regrettably, data from ICI-treated patients infected with COVID-19 are scant. Therefore, the management of ICIs in patients with cancer during the outbreak is a crucial and urgent knowledge gap facing clinicians.",

Although no specific conclusion regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in ICI-treated patients has been made, previous clinical investigations indicate that the overall infection rate of ICIrelated pneumonia in patients with a wide variety of cancers (including melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, malignant mesothelioma, urothelial carcinoma, gastric cancer and prostate cancer) was 0.3%-6.0% for monotherapy, compared with 1%-2.6% for combination therapy, with the death rate around 0.3% (table 1). Factors that positively correlate to the pulmonary infection rate in patients with cancer include (1) underlying lung diseases (asthma, interstitial lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and (2) combined immunosuppressive therapies controlling the immunerelated adverse effects (IrAEs), while ICIs themselves are not supposed to cause higher infection risk of pneumonia. 2 3 The fact that only a limited number of gathered cases in the many cohorts 4-10 reported concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection among the ICI-treated patients with cancer also confirms its relative safety with regard to infection rate. Moreover, given that ICI-induced pneumonitis might predispose patients to the development of more progressive COVID-19, we also cautiously reviewed the incidence of ",

            "text": "Notably, there are concerns that certain T-cell subsets would promote the immunopathological damage of COVID-19. In the postmortem biopsy of a patient with COVID-19, the inflammatory infiltrates in both lungs were dominated by a large portion of lymphocytes, with increased ratios of both proinflammatory CCR6 + Th17 and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells. 16 Another mechanistic study of COVID-19 further identified a pathogenic IFN-\u03b3 + Th1 subset that could secrete high amounts of GM-CSF and IL-6 to activate inflammatory CD14 + CD16 + IL-6 + monocytes, possessing a critical role in the generation of cytokine storm syndrome during pulmonary damage. 17 Correspondingly, there are also a series of cohort studies 4-6 10 and case reports [18] [19] [20] indicating that ICI treatment stands as a risk factor for COVID-19 exacerbation in patients with cancer. Strikingly, Lovly et al reported in a case report that the coronavirus infection prior to ICI treatment in a patient with lung cancer resulted in fulminant inflammatory damage in both lung alveolar and death. 20 So far, lab tests are usually not prompt or specific enough to detect T-cell subsets and functional changes in patients with cancer infected with COVID-19, which calls for the identification of useful clinicopathological factors to evaluate the severity of COVID-19-induced immunopathogenesis and to guide the usage of ICI and other T cell-targeted therapies in patients with cancer during the pandemic. Based on the aforementioned findings, pathogenic T-cell subsets with great clinical significance, including IL-6-producing Th1 subset 17 and Th17/IL-17 pathway, 21-23 could be applied as important clinicopathological indicators and should also be regularly screened in ICI-treated patients when combined with COVID-19. Notably, the expression levels of PD-1 and CTLA-4 molecules on these pathological T subsets are also of great importance, since the overactivation of these pathogenic T subsets induced by ICIs could elicit adverse outcomes in some patients with cancer in the form of an 'explosive' lung or systemic inflammation. Thus, routine lab examinations of pathogenic T-cell numbers and phenotypes will be extremely useful to guide ICI usage in patients with cancer or those who recovered from COVID-19 infection.",

Given all the evidence, it is postulated that for patients with cancer, ICI application prior to the onset of COVID-19 infection or even at the early stage of COVID-19 infection enables the activation of effector T-cell functions that could be beneficial to both antitumoral and anti-COVID-19 immune responses. However, exuberant inflammatory damage during ICI treatments could also occur in certain patients with cancer with COVID-19 infection, perhaps due to the activation of pathogenic T subsets. The conflicting results imply a timedependent shift of T-cell differentiation and their activation states along the COVID-19 course in patients with cancer. As a result, we propose a regular screening and tracking of not only the total lymphocyte count but also the pathogenic T-cell subsets and their surface exhaustion markers, which would guide clinical ICI strategies in patients with cancer amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",

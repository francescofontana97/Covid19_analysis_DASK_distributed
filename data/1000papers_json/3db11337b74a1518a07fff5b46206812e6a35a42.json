The number of articles produced by Chinese authors in the first three months of the COVID-19 period-more than 1,600 articles-surpasses the number of coronavirus articles produced by Chinese-based authors in the entire previous 24 months. As a preliminary exploration into the extent of China's involvement in international collaborative research Table 3 also reveals that by April 2020, Chinese authors together with international collaborators produced over 12% of articles in the topic of 'coronavirus'-again, more than the volume that they produced across 2018 and 2019 together.

However, the search and coordination costs of this type of collaboration are high. For scientists, the decision to engage in international collaboration represents this inherent trade-off. During a global pandemic these trade-offs intensify. The need for broad expertise and pooled resources is greater than ever, but, an urgent need for scientific input into public health and economic decisions puts a premium on transaction costs associated with long-distance and cross-cultural communications.

At the same time, Chinese researchers become more independent increasing the volume, and quality, of domestic output in the COVID-19 era. Moreover, the Chinese research funding agencies played a vital role in the earliest days in supporting high quality research and development work in China. These findings are in contrast to some popular accounts that Chinese scientists are withholding valuable information and reducing cooperation in the early stages of the global pandemic [17] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1125, "end": 1129, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although we interpret the findings as providing insight into the theoretical expectations, this study has three main limitations. First, the period used for analysis pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 is different. Due to the nature of data collection, we had a much shorter period available to us for the COVID-19 period. We account for this in the statistical analysis, however we anticipate that some of our trends may change longer term. In particular, the geographic nature of scientific production and funding may represent the geographic spread of the coronavirus. For example, the virus spread through China before it was observed in the United States, and so it is not a surprise that the Chinese government and funding agencies allocated resources earlier than the United States. Future research should explore longer term dynamics in scientific funding and productivity around the world.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Second, we use the Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP) to reflect the impact of research. There are many possible measures of research impact, including raw citations, normalized citation scores, and practical measures such as policy influence, news take-up and discussions in online forums. Despite the limitations with the use of SNIP to assess impact, including the influence of publication language, open access journals, fast track publications and the fact that publications from zero impact journals are excluded [18] , we chose this measure due to the real time data collection precluding the use of citation measures and alternative measures of influence. Future research should use a variety of impact measures to identify the most important and impactful research during the COVID-19 period.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 526, "end": 530, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Finally, our study is limited by the data available on scientific production and funding.

Future work could use data directly from funders themselves as it becomes available or surveys of researchers to ascertain any trends.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "That said, we interpret the findings from this study as providing insight into the theoretical framework, and this paper suggests that global scientists face a trade-off in decisions on international collaborative activities around time and efficiency, and that the trade-off changes dramatically during a time of urgency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The observed reduction in the rate of international collaborations and consolidation of the strongest existing bilateral relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic could have consequences for the organization of science and direction of research. One of the most important of these findings is a reduction in participation of researchers from developing countries in coronavirus related research. Future work will examine the nature of teaming, preferential attachment, the role of influential individuals in the global networks as well as the consequences of the organization of science on the evolution of research topics during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Policymakers who are tracking and guiding research into coronavirus topics and vaccines may wish to be aware of the changing dynamics of international teams. While it is important to increase efficiency, smaller teams could mean that knowledge diffusion and wide-ranging expertise and novelty are reduced [3, 15] . This fact is particularly true for those research institutions which are not among the most elite institutions or within those teams gathered around leading scientists who have ample funding. The results of the narrowing and focusing of research may mean that results arrive more quickly, but it also means the results and capacities are diffused more slowly. Validation may be compromised.

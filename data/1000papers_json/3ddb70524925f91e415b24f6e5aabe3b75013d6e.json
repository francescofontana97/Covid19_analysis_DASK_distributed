Methods: Two paired anterior nasal swabs or two paired nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each participant. Swabs were tested by the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR; Roche cobas 6800 platform). Sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were calculated. Results were stratified on the basis of gender, age, duration of symptoms, and rt-PCR cycle threshold. Results: Out of the 512 participants, aged 0-90 years, of this prospective validation study, 414 (81%) were symptomatic for COVID-19 and 123 (24%) swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on rt-PCR testing. Compared with rt-PCR, the 12-min nasal swab test had 97.6% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity, and nasopharyngeal swab had 97.5% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity, within 12 days of symptom onset, representing the period of infectivity. All (100%) samples detected within 33 rt-PCR cycles were Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi. also identified using the antigen test. Results were consistent across age and gender. The user error rate of the test system when used by minimally trained operators was 0.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-3.7%). Conclusion: The rapid, high-sensitivity assay using nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal sampling may offer significant improvements for diagnosing acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinic-and community-based settings.",

First, laboratory testing remains laborious and expensive, which may limit access for underserved and vulnerable populations. Second, a slow turnaround time for receiving laboratorybased results may delay a person's ability to selfisolate and prevent transmission [5, 6] . Third, existing diagnostic laboratories have had limited supply of molecular reagents and low-and middle-income countries have limited capacity to scale up nucleic acid testing, to meet the needs of their communities [7] . Whilst laboratory-based testing has the advantage of greater throughput, there remains an urgent need for rapid point-of-care (POC) diagnostic testing of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinic-and community-based settings [8] .",

The assay reagents are dry single-use, disposable, microfluidic test strips that contain specific antibodies to form an immunoassay complex that uses a fluorescent latex signal to detect the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a test sample (Fig. 1a) . Nasal and nasopharyngeal swab samples are extracted using the extraction buffer and a transfer vial dropper that delivers 20 lL onto a test strip, and runs two simultaneous antigen assays in sub-microliter channels. The test takes 12 min to deliver a positive or negative result after the sample had been added to the test strip and inserted into the instrument.

The study was conducted at ten sites across the United States (USA) and United Kingdom (UK), and including eight sites in which minimally trained operators collected and tested specimens. The nasal swab sample collection ran first from 26 June to 23 July 2020 in six sites (five in the USA and one in the UK). The nasopharyngeal sample collection was run following the nasal swab study (17 August-28 September 2020), in six US sites of which two of the sites were also in the earlier nasal swab collection in the USA. The clinical study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 and its later amendments, received ethical approval from WCG Institutional Review Board, and all participants, or their parents or guardians for minor patients, provided informed consent (NCT04557046 clinicaltrials.gov). Nasal swab samples were additionally provided by a commercial supplier (MRN Diagnostics, Florida, USA), and also collected from an at-risk population (LumiraDx Stirling, UK), under approved protocols and informed consent. After collecting clinical data, two paired anterior nasal swabs (Copan FLOQ swabs) or two paired nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each participant. The two swabs were collected simultaneously from both anterior nares, and both nostrils were swabbed using each of the two swabs. Each swab entered one nostril as the first-pass swab, before the swabs were switched to enter the opposite nostril as the second-pass swab. One swab was then placed into 0.7 mL of a proprietary extraction buffer for LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 antigen test, and the other swab was placed into 3 mL of viral transport media (BD Universal Viral Transport Media, VTM). Swabs in VTM were tested fresh and in agreement with the manufacturer's instructions by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) using the SARS-CoV-2 assay using a Roche cobas 6800 platform (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). All buffer specimens for anterior nasal swabs were tested at the clinical site, and then frozen within 1 h of nasal swab collection. They were subsequently retested in a blinded manner. The results from the retested frozen samples were included in the final analysis. Equivalence of fresh and samples frozen, and retested according to the method above, was shown in a separate study. All buffer specimens for nasopharyngeal swabs were tested fresh at the clinical site within 1 h of collection.",

Two have limited diagnostic sensitivity (85-88%) when used within 5 days since symptom onset [14] . Another assay demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity, but was only authorized for the first 7 days since symptom onset [14] . In contrast, this study demonstrated that the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay had high diagnostic sensitivity, particularly with rt-PCR Ct values of less than 33 cycles, as measured by the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR assay, through the first 12 days from the onset of COVID-related symptoms. The high performance of the test is due to the new test technology, using microfluidic and immunofluorescence to precisely measure antigen levels in the picogram per milliliter range. Recent studies have identified the first 10 days since symptom onset as the likely window of infectivity for the SARS-CoV-2 virus [13, 15, 16] . Several other studies have related infectivity to a low rt-PCR Ct value, which correlates to a high viral load, and/or the ability to culture SARS-CoV-2 virus [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . A study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 showed that the ability to culture SARS-CoV-2 diminished from day 10 to day 12 since symptom onset [13] . In another study of hospitalized patients, successful isolation of culturable virus correlated with rt-PCR Ct values of less than 33 cycles, while those above this level were considered to be non-infectious [19] . Rt-PCR testing has also been shown to remain positive many days past the window for culturing viable SARS-CoV-2 virus, which suggest that rt-PCR testing may be generating some positive results from people with remnant viral RNA who do not have contagious viral particles [20] . This is further supported by the finding that antigenbased testing, but not rt-PCR testing, correlates with growth of SARS-CoV-2 by viral culture [23] .",

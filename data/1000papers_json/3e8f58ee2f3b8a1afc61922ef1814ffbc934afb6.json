The unmonitored practice of general practitioner Dr Harold Shipman, appalling systemic failures at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and recent scandals in breast implants or gynaecological mesh repair have led to public mistrust in the quality of healthcare. The Francis report following the inquiry into Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust called for a significant change to NHS culture, including organizational process to detect problems early, prevent patient harm, ensure accountability and promote a culture of continuous quality improvement. 1 The Bristol Royal Infirmary inquiry highlighted inadequacies at every point of the care pathway as well as a dysfunctional 'club culture' which resulted in excess death of children undergoing heart surgery. It is therefore imperative that quality of care is under appropriate scrutiny to ensure standards are maintained and patients achieve the best outcomes. This article will discuss defining and monitoring quality in healthcare by focussing on the multifaceted approach required to ensure we appropriately scrutinize care delivery.",

Defining principles outlined in the General Medical Council's Good Medical Practice require clinicians to provide accurate and up-to-date information about their clinical practice, which ensures that patient safety is held in highest regard. Donabedian's model for measuring quality care is advocated by NHS Improvement and the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCSEng) and described three main aspects of healthcare performance that can measure quality: outcomes, process and structure ( Figure 1 ). 5 Donabedian describes a linked pattern where structure measures impact on process measures, which in turn impact on outcome measures. The emphasis is on using these three areas in parallel as employing only one outcome measure will lead to inaccurate data capture.",

Standards are predetermined and are often well-recognized national or international outcomes, which should be achieved.

The RCSEng advocate their members and fellows to continuously engage with national audit projects. The National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme (NCAPOP) hosts centrally funded national clinical audit projects that collect data on compliance with evidence-based standards, and provide local trusts with benchmarked reports on the compliance and performance.

Since its inception, several major projects have been supported including the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA), National Prostate Cancer Audit and the National Oesophagogastric Cancer Audit. The National Vascular Registry (NVR) embodies the success of collaboration amongst surgeons and the willingness to contribute data nationally to improve patient outcomes. The NVR is a national clinical audit which is commissioned by the Health Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) and run jointly by the Vascular Society or Great Britain and Ireland (VSGBI) and RCS CEU. Main index procedures within vascular surgery are included and data submitted by surgeons and interventional radiologists on process of care and outcomes. Trust level and surgeon-specific data on outcomes is available online in a transparent format providing patients with the ability to review them. The NVR Report was released annually and summarizes national outcomes highlighting areas of good performance and those areas that required improvement. Once suboptimal performance has been identified quality improvement can be initiated. The Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) 2018 report identified significant pathway delays and resultant poor outcomes for patients with lower limb ischemia. Subsequently, the Peripheral Arterial Disease Quality Improvement Framework (PAD-QIF) was launched by VSGBI with the aim of improving revascularization and reducing amputation rates. 6 This national framework is complemented by alignment of key parameters with the NVR leading to streamlined care for patients with peripheral arterial disease.",

The National Joint Registry (NJR) collates data on hip replacement surgery and this procedure has low associated perioperative mortality. The key outcome measure here is return to theatre and revision rates. Indeed, the NJR was instrumental in highlighting poorly performing metal on metal hip implants in 2008 and allowed for earlier medical device safety alert to be issued. 7 Therefore, using multiple outcome metrics including 30-day readmission, unexpected return to theatre and length of hospital stay can provide valuable insight into how care is delivered.

There was much controversy when surgeon level indicators were made publicly available in 2013 through an HQIP managed NHS England initiative called Consultant Outcomes Publication (COP). COP allowed patients the ability to review individual and trust level outcomes for key surgical procedures and aim to increase transparency in the NHS. Some suggested that a risk adverse culture would ensue to avoid negative statistics and ultimately patient care would be negatively impacted. Reporting outcomes at organization level would also effectively pool outcomes of all surgeons and perhaps dilute any negative outcomes of one particular provider. In vascular surgery, there has been no link between individual surgeon reporting and risk adverse outcomes for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. 8 However, surgeon-level reporting does not take in to account the structure of care within the institution. Technical skills are important but provision and quality of other services such as multidisciplinary team meetings, critical care services, speciality specific anaesthetic and nursing staff also directly impact outcome. Data precision is also in question when a surgeon performs low numbers of cases but this often not appreciated in outcome reports. Furthermore, in the era of more complex surgery dual consultant operating is more common and asks the question, to which consultant should the case therefore be attributed? The evidence for both sides of the argument remains disputed, but reporting both sets of outcomes is associated with quality improvement.",

Unadjusted comparisons can lead to Three aspects of quality care inappropriate investigation or inadequate reimbursement for outcomes-based payment systems. Some argue whether this methodological correction is appropriate, as services that have poor outcomes should be highlighted and consideration of increased investment made. However, this practice can help to reduce incidence of withholding intervention from patients who may be deemed as 'hard to treat' and ensure everyone is provided with healthcare irrespective of background and comorbidity. 9 Transparency in methodological calculation of case mix is also important. Detailing variables and covariables that can effect outcome which are used in case mix adjustment need to be agreed and validated otherwise they can lead to unfounded results. Case mix and local quality priorities are also relevant when an organization is designing a quality strategy. Alongside national guidelines, a local strategic vision should be set out as this encourages continuous quality improvement.",

The Nellix device was then highlighted as having suboptimal performance and a safety notice was issued by the UK Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA). Following this, the device was withdrawn from the UK market and lost its Conformit e Europ eenne mark across Europe. This incident highlighted several key problems with medical device monitoring. Commonly, only 1-year safety outcomes are required for a device to become freely available for use. Clearly, the problems with this particular device were not evident until around three years after implantation. Perhaps monitoring of novel devices should happen in national registries, similar to the National joint Registry, and devices with poor performance could be highlighted earlier. 12 External initiatives such as Beyond Compliance are set up to assess the relative risk of a new medical product, such as a joint replacement, and ensure it has ongoing monitoring and assessment.",

            "text": "An Intercollegiate Consensus was launched to provide surgeons with guidance on delivering care during COVID-19. 16 The aim was to focus on acute patients and to balance risk of admission with that of nosocomial infection. Most centres suspended elective surgery to reduce hospital footfall and ease pressure on critical care services. However, provision for emergency operating has been maintained to an extent with appropriate personal protective equipment available. Common procedures have been modified, such as the reduced use of laparoscopic surgery and more open operations to reduce aerosol generation. National surgical specialities have issued recommendations on how to triage cases for operation. The VSGBI have advised that ruptured AAAs should be managed with EVAR and open surgery only considered if sufficient critical care capacity is available. Furthermore, timelines for urgent care have been published to aid surgical decision making. During the consent process surgeons need to introduce the impact of a pandemic on a patient journey and proposed treatment plan. Performing colorectal cancer resections with no plan for an anastomosis at the index procedure is an example of this which can alleviate the risk of leak and hence likely prolonged hospital stay and of nosocomial COVID-19 infection.",

Applying the multi-faceted approach proposed by Donabedian allows us to evaluate effectively the quality of service we are providing. Engaging with national audit and quality improvement initiatives and partaking in a culture of shared learning will give the opportunity to continue improve outcomes. Continued focus and research within this area will lead to more efficient and patient centred care.",

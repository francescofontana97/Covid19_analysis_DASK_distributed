He lived with his parents and siblings at home; mother had cough, runny nose and low grade fever.

Supplemental oxygen 2 liter/minute via nasal cannula (NC) was started with a prompt rise in SPO 2 to 100%, which intermittently dropped to low 90% during talking; however, there was no labored breathing, retractions or nasal flaring.

[1] [2] [3] Hence, it is not unexpected to observe a relatively mild course of COVID-19 in the pediatric RT recipients as well, especially in those who are on low-dose maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, as the case described in this report. Although pulmonary manifestation is the most common presentation in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 7 the CXR findings may be negative as in our patient. A chest computed tomography scan with bilateral ground glass opacities is highly sensitive but is non-specific for COVID-19. 7 Gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhea may also occur. 8 Our patient had profuse watery stool at the time of presentation which persisted even after the resolution of respiratory symptoms. Indeed, the virus has been shown to be present in the stool even after its clearance from the NP samples but the stool may not be infectious. 9, 10 Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor for both the SARS-CoV and the coronavirus NL63 and is expressed in human airway epithelia and lung parenchyma. 11 Acute kidney injury (AKI) may occur in RT recipients with COVID-19. In a case series of seven adult RT recipients, four out of seven patients had AKI (57%), three required dialysis with one death. 4 The possible mechanism could be due to the virus interaction with the ACE2 receptor since ACE2 is expressed in the proximal renal tubules and glomeruli. 14, 15 Our patient had a transient rise in serum creatinine with return to baseline in a few days and did not require dialysis.",

            "text": "Management of IS in post-transplant patients with COVID-19 is challenging. Although reduction of IS at the time of active infection is reasonable, it may not be necessary as the pulmonary injury is thought to be due to the \"cytokine storm\" leading to excessive activation of the host innate immune inflammatory response. 16 Hence, being immunosuppressed may actually be of advantage as this may cause minimal to no lung and extra pulmonary tissue damage, however it remains to be proved. 17 Efficacy of steroid due to its anti-inflammatory effect also remains to be studied. In patients in whom the IS is reduced, it is challenging to determine when to resume the baseline IS given that duration of viral shedding is unknown. Extrapolating the experience from other respiratory viral infections, immunocompromised children with COVID-19 may shed the potentially infectious viral particles for an extended period of time even after recovery. 18, 19, 20 Our patient was still positive for the virus on the repeat testing at day 28.",

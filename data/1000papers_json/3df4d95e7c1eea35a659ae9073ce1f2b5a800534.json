In disaster-prone countries, like Vanuatu, such measures add to existing pressures on coastal communities' adaptive capacity. To understand how coastal communities in Vanuatu were impacted in the immediate period after COVID-19 measures were placed, and how people responded to the changing circumstances, a rapid appraisal survey was carried out following a nationally declared state of emergency in March 2020. Results reveal changes in village population, loss of cash income, difficulties in accessing food and shifting pressures on particular resources and habitats. The findings provide insights into the ways local adaptive capacity to satisfy livelihood and food security needs differed among rural contexts. From this we argue that broad quantitative impact assessments are important in guiding strategic and longer term responses and adaptations, but that these are made more useful when complemented with qualitative insights on people and place in the short-term.",

Whereas, much of the mainstream media has focused on the direct health crisis, little attention has been paid to remote coastal communities in regions like the Pacific that have been largely untouched by the virus per se, but impacted by its effects on trade and the movement of people. Vanuatu, like many Pacific Island countries, acted swiftly in face of the pandemic's rapid spread. In January 2020 a national COVID-19 taskforce was established to prepare and prevent an outbreak. By March interventions ramped up and the government declared a state of emergency, instituting a series of sweeping public health measures that saw its international borders closed, travel among islands banned, curfews on business, public transport limited and social distancing measures applied that prevented social gatherings of more than five people. To compound the situation, only weeks later the central islands of the archipelago fell in the path of category-5 Tropical Cyclone Harold (hereafter TC Harold), which passed over Vanuatu on 5th and April 6, 2020. The cyclone left in its trail significant infrastructural damage, leading to a 30-day extension of the national state of emergency as the post-disaster relief efforts were implemented. To address the priority area of access to food a COVID-19 food security response plan was endorsed by the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC). The FASC response plan promoted homestead gardening as well as stimulating access to fish through aquaculture and inshore fisheries.",

Ranked as one of the world's most disaster-prone countries [3] , Vanuatu's coastal communities frequently deal with unforeseen disruptions ranging from volcanic eruptions to extreme weather events. Past studies have highlighted the importance of natural resources in times when disasters strike, and for an archipelagic state like Vanuatu where the majority of its population lives within the coastal zone [4] , near-shore marine resources become of particular importance [5, 6] . Unforeseen external disruptions like, for example, natural disasters or, in this case national COVID-19 public health measures, have been widely noted to potentially overburden rural communities' social institutions that provide coping mechanisms or 'safety nets' for resilience [7] . Without disputing this, the extent that this is equally the case for all coastal communities (e.g. remote vs more central) remains speculative. Arguably the ability of some remote (small island) communities to deal independently with shocks and shifts [8] may suggest COVID-19 measures could be overcome also. Gaining information on the ways various coastal communities were impacted (or not) and how people responded to the changes (or not) in the wake of Vanuatu's national lock down measures, is useful in guiding priorities for relief efforts and to better understand local capabilities for adaptation.",

The sampled sites were clustered into three categories, based primarily on their degree of remoteness: seven sites represented conditions on the most remote 'outer islands' (Gaua, Aniwa and Futuna), nine sites were on less remote 'secondary-islands' (Malekula and Maewo), and seven sites represented conditions on islands with administrative centres (Santo and Efate). Restricted by travel capabilities at the time of data collection, the survey was implemented by telephone by a team of fisheries officers (two men, two women). By virtue of village leadership in Vanuatu, and difficulty in reaching women in village leadership roles by telephone, the majority of respondents were male. The results therefore do not offer a well-balanced gendered perspective nor necessarily reflect the multiple perspectives inherent to the social diversity of communities.",

Insights from this survey offer new considerations for support efforts, both short-and long-term, as well as contribute a broader understanding of coastal people's ability to deal with shocks in the Pacific region. The results below present firstly the reach of government interventions as experienced by different communities and what other disruptions communities were having to deal with next to the COVID-19 measures. In examining impacts we explore four dimensions of impacts: social life and demographics, food and nutrition security, livelihood and income, and marine resource management.

All community representatives spoken with noted having received information on COVID-19 measures, and 13 of the 23 sites reported visits by teams from their respective provincial taskforce who came to provide information about the COVID-19 measures. In those cases the CDCs were tasked to relay up-to-date information and to plan for implementation of measures including social distancing, school and church closures, curfews on community kava nakamals 2 , promoting planting of gardens closer to homesteads, and hygiene practices (see Fig. 1 ). The remaining 10 sites, which included all remote outer island sites, noted receiving information by radio, text message and/or social media, and under that guidance instituted similar measures albeit to varying extents. Several respondents noted that government directives around price fixing of essential foods like rice and tinned fish during the state of emergency were effective in ensuring stability of prices in community stores.

Inter-island travel restrictions meant food imports from Tanna were stopped. Two sites reported cases 1 Where possible, men and women were interviewed, but where this was not possible, a person in a leadership position who had some form of community oversight was interviewed. The final dataset contained 22 men and 9 women.

It was noted that this led to a subsequent sharp decline in supply of both reef and pelagic fish, out of fear of further cases, and in turn exacerbated the lack of protein availability at those sites. Impacts of volcanic activity were noted by two sites; one on Tanna and one on Maewo. The former site reported that ash fall compromised recent harvest from gardens, thus restricting their ability to produce food in these times when travel to market was not possible. The latter site noted impacts of a pre-COVID-19 population rise following the mass 3 Ciguatera fish poisoning occurs as a result of consumption of fish contaminated with ciguatoxins; resulting in symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, numbness, itchiness, sensitivity to hot and cold, dizziness, and weakness.

As a respondent from one of the Maskelyn sites noted, \"The measures against socialising with friends, neighbours and family has affected our dayto-day relationships we value and rely on, [\u2026] we find it strange and impossible to cope with.\" Another respondent from a Tanna site referred to the physical structure of communities making social distancing difficult, \"We can't keep distance since all our houses are close to each other and we all share the same space in our houses, even between neighbours.\" Some community leaders noted how important social institutions were no longer reinforced due to the restriction on social gatherings. They noted people's commitment to faith and religion was weakened since attendance at church was no longer possible. As one Tanna village woman leader noted, \"People are not praying as often as they used to because we are not gathering for church [\u2026] we are afraid people are losing spiritual touch with important morals.\"",

In terms of trade of fish within the village, 19 of the sampled sites noted less or similar trade of fish while four sites noted an increase. Of the four sites noting increased internal trade, three were capital-and secondary-islands sites where a significant influx of youth into the village saw more small reef fish being caught and sold within the village.

Where much of the government messaging used radio and text messaging, several communities did not have radios or had unreliable phone or radio signal. As an example, in the days preceding TC Harold's landfall, bad weather had cut off tele-communication to some sites in SW Santo. This meant warning updates of TC Harold's approach were missed, with some respondents noting that people had been caught working in the gardens (or staying in upland garden sleep stations) when the storm struck. Outer-island sites in the south relied heavily on radio and telecommunication for information on COVID-19 measures and updates on transport and travel restrictions. In those sites similar challenges to connectivity led to misunderstandings and increased anxiety as misinformation on COVID-19 spread through social media postings, reached these communities. Another common compromising factor noted by respondents was the increased transition to cash-based economies, often noting an over-dependence on tourism or on inter-island trade in commodities like fish and kava. While respondents in sites on the larger capital-and secondary-islands noted that some were able to maintain trade with other communities on the island, outer-island sites had no alternative. Other factors noted by respondents on outer-islands included poor agriculture conditions that over time had resulted in people's increasing dependency on food provision from outside.",

Food relief support was in highest demand in cases where home gardens could not meet food demand, e.g. where agriculture conditions were poor or where natural hazards destroyed crops. Outer island sites noted a double burden where agricultural production was already poor and home garden harvests small, and access to markets or food relief was cut off because of restricted interisland travel. Such communities that depend on trade of resources (e. g. fish) to purchase food they do not have, struggle to meet their food demands when mobility is restricted.

Total fish catch in all sites was said to have declined, mainly because pelagic and deep bottom fishing practices stopped due to lack of fuel and market access. As such the lack of large fish being caught further exacerbated fishing on easy-access immediate inshore zones. The importance of community-based fisheries management in majority of sites proved vital in curbing demand-driven exploitation and controlling access. Given shocks like COVID-19 are a recurrent feature of Vanuatu life, and the importance of fish to meet food and nutrition needs in such times, it is imperative that resource management capacity in Vanuatu communities is supported and further developed [see also [13] [14] [15] ]. The form in which (and intensity by which) this support and development is delivered will be dependent on local context. Understanding that the sampled sites were all engaged in some form of fisheries co-management, the results suggest such engagements are largely beneficial during COVID-19 disruptions. This however, does not capture the potential of customary institutions that other communities (where resources are not co-managed with VFD) may be drawing on in their control over access and use of resources in such times. A better understanding of the relative contributions of customary and co-management relationships requires expansion of the sample to villages not receiving support from VFD. There is clearly value in this for other national agencies, to better understand the efficacy of different forms of local resource management.",

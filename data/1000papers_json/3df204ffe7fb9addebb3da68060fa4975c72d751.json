One advantage over deterministic models calculated with differential equations is that the progression over time can be modelled stochastically, and interventions can be incorporated into the sequence. This allows for example the formation of a second wave to be simulated with straightforward models. More complex agent-based models use real data for the simulation of infections [1] , [2] , [3] .",

The agents (= individuals) are points (identified by integer coordinates) in a rectangular coordinate system. Initially, every agent is susceptible to infection. The process begins with one infected individual (at the origin). Each infected individual can infect the directly adjacent individuals to the left, right, above, and below. Thus, the first infected individual can infect up to four other individuals immediately adjacent to it. A predetermined number of these four individuals are randomly selected, e.g. two new individuals, who are then considered to be infected. This allows the basic reproduction rate R0 to be specified. This process is iterated after defining the recovery rate \u03b2, which describes how long an infected individual remains sick and able to infect others. In the model considered here, the duration of the disease and the infectious period are taken to be equal. At the end of the period, the infected individual joins the group of restored individuals. In a simple model with no mobility of infected individuals, the spread is essentially centrifugal, ending once a certain percentage of individuals have been infected and ultimately join the restored group. This proportion depends on R0 and corresponds to the phenomenon of herd immunity.",

Whether the observed probability gap plays an important role in the course of real infections must be answered by future studies. If the findings are transferable, it could mean that even a relatively low vaccination quota might cause an infection to disappear from a population with a certain probability if the corresponding R0 values are reached and maintained, without requiring herd immunity to be achieved. If so, the gap could be described as a 'gap of good hope'. However, it would not imply that infection can no longer occur. Isolated clusters would still remain possible. The infection will only be extinguished if infected individuals 'from outside' can be consistently prevented from entering the population, which remains partially susceptible. The next step is to calculate a mathematical and probabilistic basis for the model presented here. It should also be investigated whether the same effect continues to manifest in more complex agentbased models. The question of whether there are indications of such an effect in real infection processes is of course of great interest. This stochastic phenomenon might offer an explanation for the occasionally surprising course of infections in relatively well-isolated populations, regions or cities.",

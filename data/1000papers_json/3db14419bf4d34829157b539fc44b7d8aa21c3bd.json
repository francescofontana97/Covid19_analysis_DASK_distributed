In order to get high-quality cell clusters, we used the Leiden community detection implemented in the R package leiden, a wrapper of the python package leidenalg. The leiden() function was applied to the KNN graphs with default parameters for each analysis. Marker genes were identified using the getDifferentialGenes() function. UMAP low dimensional embedding was computed using the uwot R package, and more precisely the umap() function with the n_neighbors parameter set to 30, and the metric parameter set to 'cosine'. In order to group clusters of cells in the first round of analysis, mean gene expression of the most variable genes was computed using the aggregate() function. Spearman's correlation matrix was then com-puted using the cor() function with the method parameter set to 'Spearman'. Hierarchical clustering was then performed on this matrix using Ward's method and the resulting tree used to aggregate the cell clusters.",

In order to identify trends in cellular composition across samples we used a multivariate technique called Correspondance Analysis (CA). CA is highly similar to PCA but is applied to contingency table instead of classical continuous data table. First data are pre-processed by dividing each entry by the sum of all matrix entries resulting in the matrix S. Then a second matrix is computed by subtracting the expected distribution of samples (obtained by multiplying the row and column marginal probably vectors) resulting in a new matrix M. M is then decomposed using singular value decomposition. Because CA is a descriptive technique, it has the advantage of being applicable to tables whether or not the chi-squared statistic is appropriate. We used the R implementation of CA from the package FactoMineR (CA() function) with default parameters. To determine the significant components we looked at the scree plot and selected the eigenvalues/component located before the elbow. To improve the quality of our analysis, we re-moved cell clusters corresponding to red blood cells, platelets and cancer cells from patient 8.",

For the other continuous variables (clinical scores, age, BMI\u2026), Pearson's correlation was directly computed. To test the association between CA component or a specific cell type proportion and a categorical variable (i.e. patient clinical status and survival) we either applied a Tukey's range test (TukeyHSD() function) if the variable is not heavy tailed. If the cell proportions are clearly heavy-tailed, we applied a Kruskall-Wallis rank test. Normality of the variables was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test, through the R function shapiro.test().",

To detect and study viruses in our scRNA-seq samples we used Viral-Track, a computational tool that screen the raw sequencing files to find viral reads (32479746). As previous-ly described, processing of the file was performed using UMI-tool (28100584). First, cell barcodes were extracted and a putative whitelist computed using the umi_tools whitelist command with the parameters '-stdinbc-pattern = CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCNNNNNNNNNN -log2stderr'. Fol-lowing the mapping of the reads to viral genomes and transcript assembly, the mapped reads were assigned to transcripts using the R package Rsubread through the function featureCounts() with de-fault parameters. The command 'umi_tools count' is then used to compute the final expression table with the following parameters:-per-gene-gene-tag = XTassigned-status-tag = XS-per-cell. In the case of patient 8, cells were not filtered on total host UMIs and proportion of MT UMIs but only on total combined host and viral UMIs to avoid removing apoptotic cells containing a high vi-ral load but expressing few host genes.",

Analysis of the serum cytokine, blood cell count and clinical data. Using a Cullen and Frey graph (descdist() function from the fitdistrplus package)we observed that both serum cytokine and blood cell count variables could be transformed into gaussian-like variables by applying a simple square root function and then used for further analysis. Association between blood cell counts or serum cytokine concentration and patient clinical status was assessed by fitting an ANOVA model to the transformed variables (aov() and anova() functions). Correction for multiple testing was done using the p.adjust function with parameter method set to 'BH'. When correlations with a CA dimension were computed, the cor() function with default parameters was used. To validate the association between the SOFA score and the lymphoid CA dimension 1 we fitted a basic linear model with the lm() function and assessed the significance of the association by performing a Fisher test with the anova() function.",

Based on the investigators' experience, gained in the onco-immunological field, considering the time and economic resources available, the investigators expect to enroll at least 80 patients.

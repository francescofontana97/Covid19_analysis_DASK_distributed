In France, their intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 varied across time and across professional categories [6] . On May 18, 2021, SPF reported that 91.7% of HCPs had received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and 63.4% were fully vaccinated [5] . This proportion of vaccinated HCPs is probably overestimated as other employees of healthcare facilities were vaccinated, but acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines among HCPs does seem to increase. In March 2021, the French National Academy of Medicine stated that COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory for HCPs [7] . On May 25, 2021, they reiterated their statement and made a decision for mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 for various occupations and activities: HCPs, essential workers, students, travels, etc. [8] . These statements were not endorsed by the authorities at this time. An opinion poll demonstrated that the French general population was favorable to a mandatory vaccine for HCPs (IFOP/Fiducial March 11, 2021) . While COVID-19 vaccination is highly recommended for HCPs, and might become required to attend various social events and to travel, it is time to address or re-address the question of a mandatory COVID-19 vaccine in French HCPs.",

Mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 for HCPs would be an effective way to reach high vaccine coverage but raises ethical issues based on four principles: Beneficence, Non-maleficence, Justice, and Autonomy [21] . Beneficence arguments Page 5 of 9 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f include: 1) increase in COVID-19 vaccine coverage related to mandatory vaccination will possibly benefit patients, household contacts (now proven), and colleagues of HCPs considering the now proven impact of COVID-19 vaccines on transmission; 2) HCPs may also experience personal benefit from COVID-19 vaccines as COVID-19 vaccines exhibit high efficacy to prevent infection, and since viral circulation remains high. Regarding non-maleficence, a mandatory vaccine program may cause harm to HCPs who would be vaccinated against their will. However, side effects of COVID-19 vaccination are rare (1.4/1,000 administered doses), and the frequency of serious adverse events is 3/10,000 administered doses. A mandatory program could also enhance suspicion against vaccines as a whole. This is however uncertain in France as SPF observed an increase in vaccine coverage for non-mandatory vaccines since the extension of mandatory vaccinations to 11 vaccines in infants born after January 1, 2018, and an increase in the proportion of the French population favorable to vaccines in general [22] . Autonomy of HCPs in making decision about COVID-19 vaccination means that HCPs have equal access to evidence. However, COVID-19 is associated with infodemic, and HCPs are also exposed to false and misleading information. Health literacy is critical to identify false and misleading information in the infodemic context [23] . Social gradients were observed in health literacy level, and may contribute to the discrepancies observed in intention to get vaccinated between the various professional categories of HCPs. Equal access to reliable and readable information should be ensured for all HCP categories. If COVID-19 vaccine were to become mandatory for HCPs but not for the general population, HCPs may consider this situation unfair and a source of injustice. On the contrary, while the \"COVID Health Pass\" (certificate of recent testing, or recent proven SARS-CoV-2 infection, or vaccination) was recently approved to attend large events in The increase in vaccine coverage (even observed for non-mandatory vaccines) since the introduction of the 11 mandatory vaccines might be in part due to changes in \"vaccinators'\" attitudes.",

            "text": "Interventions aiming to help HCPs make an evidence-based decision should be prioritized and should address concerns of all HCP professional categories. In addition, incentives may also contribute to increase vaccine coverage in healthcare facilities. Alternatively to mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for all HCPs, the vaccine could only be required for HCPs in direct contact with vulnerable patients for whom evidence of sub-optimal effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines is available. This would include solid organ transplant recipients, bone marrow transplant recipients, and patients with active malignancies as described in the cocooning strategy [14] . In any case, a mandatory vaccination policy should be associated with adequate training of all HCP categories, aiming to discuss all concerns, with a thorough and transparent evaluation of its effectiveness and safety, and a large and reliable communication on its impact.",

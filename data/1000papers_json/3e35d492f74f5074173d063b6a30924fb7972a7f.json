            "text": "The relationship between working hours and sustainability has attracted research attention since at least the early 2000s, yet the role of care giving in this context is not well understood. Focusing on Australians between 40 and 60 years who have reduced their working hours and income, we explore the relationship between working hours, care giving and consumption. Data from the national census (ABS, 2006(ABS, , 2011(ABS, , 2016c were analysed to contextualise patterns in paid working hours, income and carer roles for men and women aged between 40 and 60 years. Findings from a national survey on informal carers (ABS, 2016a) were also consulted. Taken together, the two sources of national data showed that two thirds of all informal carers are women, that the likelihood of assuming informal carer roles increases with age, and that men and women in carer roles work fewer paid hours per week and have a lower weekly income than non-carers of the same age. To gain qualitative insights into these patterns in Australian national data, and the likely implications of carer roles for household consumption, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten households who subsequently recorded details of their consumption-related expenses over a seven-day period. The interview data showed the strong connection between carer roles, reduced income and paid working hours and its strongly gendered dimension. We argue that women primarily 'downshift' to undertake care rather than for sustainability motivations and that there is consequently a need to connect scholarship on gender and care with that on downshifting. The link between reducing paid working hours, care-giving and household consumption appeared to be less straight forward and varied between households. Our findings suggest that a complex relationship exists between environmental and social welfare concerns that has policy implications and warrants further exploration.",

            "text": "The strong and widely recognised relationship between unchecked economic growth and environmental degradation (Jackson 2011) manifests at the household scale in the relationship between household income and levels of consumption, with increasing income leading to greater resource use (Ivanova et al. 2016 , Wiedenhofer et al. 2018 . To date, the only check on the global trend of increasing household consumption and its associated environmental impacts has occurred during global economic downturns and this is quickly reversed when economic conditions improve (Peters et al. 2011) . The unfolding economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, while historic in scale, may well follow a similar trajectory. While ideas of prosperity without growth (Jackson 2011 ) and de-growth (Kallis 2017) have been a consistent focus in academic research for some decades, government policy in affluent countries such as Australia remains strongly focused on exponential economic growthand this focus is likely to be vigorously renewed as the pandemic subsides in major economies. Household expenditure, reported through the system of national accounts, is considered an important measure of the health of the domestic economy and Australia has one of the highest rates of per capita household consumption in the world, with food, energy and transport the most environmentally consequential consumption domains (Ivanova et al. 2016 ). Yet this disguises the fact that Australian households do not uniformly increase their income over time, while some households actively decrease it. In this paper we focus on this latter phenomenon through examining the characteristics of those of working age (40-59 years) who reduce their paid working hours and income and thus potentially constrain household expenditure. In doing so, we are particularly interested in understanding the relationship between levels https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.06.003 Received 29 July 2019; Received in revised form 28 April 2020; Accepted 1 June 2020 of household consumption and the complex interweaving of paid working hours, gender, and carer roles within households.",

            "text": "We draw, here, on two distinct bodies of scholarship that have developed independently of one another. The relationship between gender, care and consumption has been a central theme in feminist social research which has long argued that unpaid domestic labour be included in definitions of work and studies of working life. A strand of this scholarship has focused on social concerns around work-life balance in the context of long hours spent in paid work and commutes (Pocock 2005 , Bittman and Ironmonger 2011 , Rau and Edmondson 2013 . A somewhat different body of scholarship has developed around the problem of escalating consumption within highly urbanised societies that focuses on the relationship between hours spent in paid work and increasing levels of consumption (Hamilton and Mail 2003 , Schor 2005 , Pullinger 2014 ). In recognising this nexus between labour and consumption, Jackson (2005) argued that reducing consumption could deliver a double dividend -allowing improved quality of life as well as reducing environmental impacts -although he cautioned that the social and cultural changes involved would require \"sophisticated policy interventions at many different levels\" (Jackson 2005: 32) . In this context, the phenomena of downshifting has, since the early 2000s, attracted the attention of a number of researchers seeking to understand the potential for voluntary reduction in consumption. Generally defined as a voluntary reduction in paid working hours and income in order to live better quality lives with lower levels of consumption (Chhetri et al., 2009 , Kennedy et al. 2013 , downshifting is hypothesised to connect issues of ecological sustainability, social justice and individual wellbeing (Schor 1998 (Schor , 2001 . Various studies have suggested that voluntary reduction in paid working hours is linked with increased investment of time in both care-giving and leisure activities, while the consequence for household consumption appears to be more ambiguous (N\u00e4ss\u00e9n and Larsson 2015 , Buhl and Acosta 2016 , Hanbury et al. 2019 .",

Downshifting has mainly been studied in affluent countries with a predominant focus on quality of life outcomes; and early research linked downshifting with lifestyle residential transitions such as tree changing or sea changing by people who are in a position to make such choices (Etzioni and Taylor-Gooby 1998; Hamilton and Mail 2003) . However, such niche phenomena may not reflect the character of reducing paid work across the wider population. When defined simply as a decision to reduce paid working hours and income, regardless of political viewpoint, downshifting is likely to capture a wider range of motives (Chhetri et al 2009) .",

(2009) surveyed an adult population (aged 18 years and older) in SE Queensland, Australia, in the late 1990s when the region was experiencing rapid population growth due to lifestyle in-migration, in order to identify the demographic profile and motivations of downshifters in that region. Based on a definition that included households of all ages in which at least one adult had voluntarily reduced income and working hours, they identified three clusters of downshifters with shared demographic characteristics: 1) family-focused change-seeking mature downshifters, characterised by married couples with children and high levels of education and income, 2) non-working, mature married women downshifters (who were generally less educated and older than cluster 1); and married couples on low incomes drawn from paid work, superannuation, and/or welfare payments, and 3) singles and single parent 'ecocentric' disadvantaged downshifters, who were overwhelmingly people living in non-conventional households or either alone or in shared households (often apartments).",

(2013) who surveyed downshifters in Edmonton in Alberta, a Canadian province characterised by higher than average working hours and household income. Downshifting was found to be strongly related to household structure, with downshifter households more likely than non-downshifters to have children. Spending more time with children was a main motivator for 42% of these downshifter households, followed by valuing leisure time over additional income (20%). Environmental concerns and reducing consumption did not feature at all in survey responses; evidence that counters the conclusions of earlier work that aligned downshifting with environmental social movements (Schor 1998, Hamilton and Mail 2003) . Further, Kennedy et al. (2013) specifically focused on exploring quality of life and pro-environmental behaviours, including sustainable consumption practices. Once again, however, survey respondents did not report significant improvement in their quality of life, nor did they report using more sustainable forms of transport. Nevertheless, respondents did report a shift towards more sustainable household practices; a result, if not an intention, of their downshifting experience that can be interpreted as a form of inadvertent environmentalism (Hitchings et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "Other studies have been framed around the relationship between time use and resource consumption. A qualitative study conducted with seventeen relatively affluent Swiss employees who had voluntarily reduced their paid working hours found that their newly gained time was primarily allocated to parenting or further education activities and, to a lesser extent, voluntary work (Hanbury et al. 2019) . These activities were attributed to preference rather than financial necessity but, as a consequence, there was no increase in discretionary time for leisure activities. Some carbon-intensive activities such as travelling or shopping were reduced due to financial constraints. In an earlier study, drawing on data from a Swedish Household Budget Survey and the Swedish Time Use Survey, N\u00e4ss\u00e9n and Larsson (2015) assessed the implications of shorter working hours for greenhouse gas emissions from Swedish households. They found that a decrease in paid working hours could have a significant impact in reducing both energy use and greenhouse gas emissions which was largely explained by the strong relationship between paid working hours, income and consumption. However, a more complex picture emerges from a study of the rebound effects resulting from the freeing up of time through reduced paid working hours of downshifters in Germany (Buhl and Acosta 2016) . Drawing on interviews and data from national time use surveys, this study examined how time and expenditure budgets were rearranged through downshifting and assessed the implications of this for resource use in households. In doing so, Buhl and Acosta found that downshifters allocated their newfound time to hobby pursuits, childcare and, to a lesser extent, housework, educational activities and sleep. The prioritising of these activities was strongly influenced by family status and gender, with women spending more time on household chores, errands and childcare, and men on leisure, repairs and hobbies, findings that corroborate those of an earlier study in the UK (Druckman et al. 2012 ). While allocating time to these activities increased levels of social engagement and sense of wellbeing, Buhl and Acosta found that the benefits for reduced household consumption were less clear, as some leisure activities involved more intensive resource use. While the net effect on resource use was found to be beneficial, the authors concluded that other policy measures, such as increased taxes on resource intensive goods and services, were needed to steer the use of leisure time towards more environmentally desirable activities.",

We acknowledge that caring involves affective and relational dimensions but critically, care also involves unpaid domestic labour.

The findings of Buhl and Acosta (2016) on the different ways in which male and female downshifters allocated their time signal that the everyday experience of downshifting may also be strongly gendered. Our research explicitly addresses the relationship between care-giving, working hours and consumption through a focus on two key questions: 1) What is the relationship between carer roles, reduced paid working hours and income, and 2) How does care-giving among people who have reduced their paid working hours affect household consumption?

This age cohort comprises people of working age who are less likely to be caring for young children than those under 40 years. In 2006 18.6% of the population were in this age cohort, in 2011 19.6%, and in 2016 18.7% (ABS, 2016b). Australia's national census includes questions about hours worked, income and informal (unpaid) carer duties. It is conducted every five years and all Australian households are required to return responses. Our analysis first sought to identify patterns in hours worked of men and women between the ages of 40 and 60 years over the 2006, 2011 and 2016 census years. As previous studies have tended to report changes in working hours and carer roles over the whole life course, the 10-year span of these three census collections provided an opportunity to track how working hours changed for Australians aged 40 and over as they aged. The data was extracted through the Tablebuilder database provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS, 2016b). However, data provided through this facility is structured in a way that only enabled us to conduct bivariate or trivariate analyses. As individual level data is not provided, it is not feasible to test causal relationships using regression techniques. Nevertheless, the advantage with census data is that all analyses are based on a full count of the population (e.g. in 2016 there were 2.1 million women and 2.3 million men who were aged 40-59 years and employed), thus making tests for statistical significance redundant.",

Finally, we returned to the national census data to examine the relationship between carer roles and income. Together, these two national data sets provided clear evidence of a relationship between working hours, income, and carer roles and how these change for women and men between the ages of 40 and 60 as they age.

Each interview concluded by asking participants to reflect on how they felt about reducing their paid working hours in terms of their sense of being in control, their experience of self and wellbeing, and their social interactions. Interviews were recorded and fully transcribed. Following the interview, each participant was asked to record details of their daily consumption activities and daily expenditure in relation to food, transport and leisure for seven consecutive days. Records of expenditure provided an indicator of consumption patterns and a means of comparing the consumption activities of study participants.

Sample sizes for the cohorts are shown in Table 2 . Fig. 1 shows the pattern of paid hours worked by the cohort of women who were aged 40-44 in 2006, following them over the three census periods. These women increased their paid working hours noticeably after entering their mid-40s and tapered off slightly as they entered their mid-50s. Fig. 3 shows a distinctly different pattern for the paid hours worked by the cohort of men who were aged 40-44 in 2006. While paid working hours for women fluctuated over the ten-year period, paid working hours for men in the same age cohort remained relatively stable. The most likely explanation for the contrasting patterns for women and men is that many women are caring for children in their early 40s and return to longer paid workforce hours as their children become more independent. In order to establish if the pattern shown in Fig. 1 applied to older age cohorts less likely to be caring for children, we charted the paid working hours for women in four different age cohorts in 2006: 40-44, 45-49, 50-54 and 55-59 , then compared that with the same age cohorts in 2011 and 2016 (Fig. 3) . In each successive census year, the paid hours worked by women aged 40-59 years increased over the 10-year time span and, by 2016, there was less difference between the paid working hours of women in the four age groups (depicted in Fig. 3 ). This pattern of change seems to align broadly with a national trend of increasing paid working hours over time. An analysis of labour force survey data for the period 1978-2010 showed that the average actual weekly hours worked for full-time and part-time employed people, for both men and women of all ages, have increased steadily (HILDA 2016). The slight differences in the shape of the four curves representing four different age cohorts at three points in time (2006, 2011 and 2016) show that women work less paid hours in their early 40s (probably due to parental roles), increase their paid working hours through their late 40s and early 50s, then reduce them again in their late 50s. These findings correspond with those of international studies on time use and gender differences in parenting (Craig and Mullan 2010) and on the relationship between carer roles and paid working hours more generally (Bauer and Sousa-Poza 2015) .",

The Australian Bureau of Statistics defines a carer as, 'a person who provides any informal assistance, in terms of help or supervision, to people with disability or older people (aged 65 years and over). Assistance must be ongoing, or likely to be ongoing, for at least six months', and a primary carer is, 'a person who provides the most informal assistance, in terms of help or supervision, to a person with one or more disabilities, with one or more of the core activities of mobility, self-care or communication' (ABS, 2016a). Table 3 lists the categories of care giving practices recognised by the ABS. The average age of informal carers in Australia in 2015 was 55 years and two thirds of all informal carers were female. While women in the 40-59 age group were more likely to be primary carers than men, both men and women were equally more likely to become primary carers as they aged (ABS, 2016a). Using national census data, we generated a more detailed picture of informal carers across the 40-59 age group that indicates how the likelihood of carer roles increases with each fiveyear age increment.

Rates of home ownership in Australia have decreased over time and the decline between 2001 and 2014 was mainly experienced by those in younger age cohorts (HILDA 2016: 68) . This means that while the likelihood of carer responsibilities increases with age (along with an associated decrease in weekly income), the likelihood of owning a home outright is also higher. It may be the case that the financial security provided by home ownership makes it more feasible for carers to survive on a lower income. Our interview research, discussed below, provides insights into how home ownership influenced participants' capacity to reduce their paid working hours.",

Informal carers across the Australian population are predominantly women, and the likelihood of carer roles increasing with age helps to explain these differences. Based on the analysis of census data and the summary findings from the national disability survey presented above, we draw the following conclusions around the relationship between paid working hours, care-giving and income:",

(iii) Women and men who provide informal (unpaid) care are likely to earn less than those who do not provide care. (iv) The different pattern of personal income for women and men aged 50-54 may reflect the much larger portion of women performing unpaid carer roles. (v) Informal carers, both women and men, are likely to be home owners. (vi) Informal carers in their 40s, both women and men, are more likely to withdraw completely from the labour market compared with those in their 50s who are more likely to work part time. Lane, et al. Geoforum 114 (2020) 66-76 From these conclusions we can infer that carer roles are likely to impact on household consumption based on the known relationship between income and resource consumption at the household level. The link between high household income and high levels of consumption is well established (Ivanova et al. 2016 ) but the impact of care on this dynamic is yet to be clarified. On the one hand, we note that carer roles are linked to low personal income, as primary carers of working age are likely to work fewer paid hours than non-carers. On the other hand, carers are more likely to be home-owners which suggests that some measure of financial security is necessary to support the take up of informal care work over paid work. Our interview research provides further insights into how these dynamics of gender, care, paid working hours and home ownership play out within the downshifting household.",

Significance of care-giving in the decision to reduce paid working hours Among participants in this study, motivations for reducing paid working hours included changing family circumstances, carer responsibilities, work-related stress, declining work opportunities and personal health. It was not always possible to determine whether reducing paid employment was entirely voluntary or partly a response to a change in work opportunities or conditions, health concerns of participants, or a need to provide care to family members. However, a key finding was the prevalence of carer roles following a reduction in paid working hours, with nine of the ten participants performing informal care labour for family members. For some, this was given as the main reason for reducing paid working hours. Even when care-giving was not given as a reason for reducing paid working hours, it was evident that more time was subsequently invested in caring labour. In this respect, care-giving appeared to problematise the notion that reducing paid working hours and income is a voluntary decision. In our sample, dominated by women, gender and care-giving appear to be central to understanding the reduction in paid working hours.",

Her 18-year-old son, who and lived with them while undertaking a trade apprenticeship, had health problems and was dependent on her support. Sandra previously worked full time running a cafe but at the time of interview worked part time in an aged care facility. Since downshifting, she has invested considerable time caring for her aging parents who live 100 km away and also assists her sister and elderly aunt with their needs. Lisa (aged 42) provides a further example of reducing paid work to prioritise care. She reduced her working hours as a medical practice manager in order to support her partner Paul (aged 61) following the death of his adult son in a car accident. Besides downshifting allowing time for grieving and partner support, she wanted to reduce work stress and prioritise leisure travel with Paul, who had fully retired. Care of the self was also a motivation for reducing paid working hours. For example, Christi (aged 48) reduced her long working hours as a manager in a government agency to manage work-related stress and allow time to care for herself. She now spends more time socialising with friends and family members which she finds personally fulfilling (Table 4) .",

Food purchasing and meal preparation was the only area of consumption and household work to show a consistent pattern of change among participants after they reduced their paid working hours. However, this change was a source of both pleasure and increased household dutieswith these duties unfolding along gender lines. Almost all participants, regardless of income or carer responsibilities, reported undertaking more food preparation at home. The need to be thriftier in food purchasing was given as a reason for this by seven of the ten participants, and some interviewees had changed to shopping at discount supermarkets where fresh food was less expensive. Christi, mentioned above, explained that reduced working hours meant that her and her family were less likely to purchase take-away food; and she described the pleasure she felt when family members complimented her home cooked meals. Maria (aged 45), who left well paid professional employment to join her partner in Bendigo, explained that she now needed to the consider the cost of food more carefully but felt more in control of the household and able to ensure meals were fresh and healthy. Unsurprisingly, increased meal preparation predominantly fell to women within downshifting households, while gender was a factor also in related household domains. Two participants, for example, reported that their male partners were now growing fresh vegetables -a welcome and important component of their diet post-downshifting. These experiences suggested that there could well be a 'double dividend' (Jackson 2005) to reduced paid working hours at least in relation to food, given participants readily linked home cooked meals with quality of life as well as cost-saving. However, from the perspective of gendered labour, a dividend appears less clear-cut.",

Our quantitative analysis found clear connections between unpaid caring, paid working hours and income. The fluctuations in paid working hours of women between the ages of 40 and 60 compared with the more stable paid working hours of men of similar ages is likely to reflect the higher portion of women in informal (unpaid) carer roles. While two thirds of all informal carers in Australia are women, the likelihood of carer responsibilities increases with age and this may explain the drop off in paid working hours of women over the age of 55. We found that both women and men in carer roles had a lower income than those of a similar age who were not carers. As income is closely bound up with consumption, these patterns could have important environmental consequences and our qualitative study provided some insights into the factors at play when people transition to shorter paid working hours and ostensibly have more time but less income.",

Reducing paid working hours was often associated with increased unpaid carer roles, it was also related to housing security but did not appear to reduce consumption in a straightforward way. For more wealthy participants, time freed up by reduced paid working hours was invested in leisure activities involving road and air travel, activities with high environmental impacts. By contrast, food provisioning appeared to be a key area where our predominantly female participants were investing time in activities with a lower environmental consequence, as preparing and consuming food at home was likely to have lower impacts than their former reliance on take-away food. Activities such as shopping and preparing food were commonly explained in terms of the need to be thriftier but some participants found the preparation and sharing of meals to be personally rewarding. However, it should be noted also that food provisioning links strongly with gendered care tasks and the maintenance of family relationships (Lindsay and Maher 2013) . Above all, consumption activities took place, for many participants, in the context of having shifted from paid working hours to the unpaid provision of informal care to family members.",

When the insights from our qualitative interviews are combined with our analysis of national census data and summary findings of the national survey on Disability, Ageing and Carers in Australia (ABS, 2016a), our study suggests that downshifting in the 40-59 age group in Australia is likely to include a large portion of informal carers who are predominantly women. While this age group includes parents caring for young children, it also includes those caring for adult children, grandchildren, aging partners and older relatives (Williams and Nadin 2012 , Van Houtven et al. 2013 , Horsfall and Dempsey 2015 . These carer roles are more likely to be experienced by women but they become more likely for both women and men as they age. We argue that the neglect of gendered patterns of paid work and unpaid care work is a major oversight in the literature on downshifting, which has tended to focus on the benefits for social wellbeing and environmental sustainability, without acknowledging the wider structural patterns that may undercut the quality of the downshifting experience. These include the different position of men and women in relation to both the paid labour market and unpaid domestic labour, including care tasks. The gendered character of work and care is further influenced by financial and housing security. While we set out to study the relationship between voluntary reduction in paid working hours and themes of care-giving and consumption, our findings problematise the voluntary character of such decisions, suggesting more complicated socio-emotional dynamics underpinning both the decision to reduce paid working hours and the subsequent experience, particularly for women. It is well established that gendered inequalities in the paid labour market and limited state provision of care mean that women are more likely than men to decrease paid labour when care is needed at home (Pocock 2005 , Maher, Lindsay and Franzway 2008 , Lilly et al. 2010 .",

Chhetri et al.'s (2009) large sample survey of downshifters in South East Queensland, for example, found that women were only slightly more likely to downshift than men, although one of the most common reasons given was to spend more time with one's family (and one of the socio-demographic clusters they identified among downshifters was dominated by single mother households). Further, Chhetri at al. found that, overall, women were more likely to downshift by stopping paid work or reducing their working hours, while men were more likely to downshift by changing careers or starting a new business. Similarly, Kennedy et al. (2013) found that downshifting was strongly related to household structure, with downshifter households were more likely than non-downshifters to have children. Downshifters in their study also indicated that the desire to spend more time with children was a motivator for their decision, but this was not further investigated. Finally, those studies that have examined carer roles in more detail have tended to focus on parental care and thus neglected other forms of informal care that we have identified here (Stone 2010; Williams and Nadin 2012) .",

Rather than focus on lifestyle choices, as in the downshifters literature, we argue that it is more productive to understand this phenomena, and its contingent changes to consumption practices, through the lens of care, or by \"thinking through care\" (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017) and understanding care as a socio-material relation (Power 2019) . For example, investing time in food preparation and managing household energy efficiencies can all be considered as practices of care that also reduce the household environmental footprint. The significance of home ownership in enabling carer roles is another example. The connections we have identified around reducing paid working hours, caring labour and consumption also signal potential areas of overlap in government policy, such as public transport and home-based support for informal carers. Practices of care feature in many social and environmental policy contexts, but areas of overlap between the two are rarely considered (Kronsell and Stens\u00f6ta 2015) .",

Our findings support the argument of N\u00e4ss\u00e9n and Larsson (2015) that reducing paid working hours will not necessarily lead to more sustainable household consumption in the absence of policy levers such as environmental taxes or public transport infrastructure or subsidies. Indeed, travel associated with both daily activities and with leisure is a key area for policy attention in working to reduce the environmental impacts of downshifters, with different strategies required for households in different wealth categories and with differing carer obligations. While our research was motivated by concern with the consequences of reducing paid work for household consumption, the theme of care emerged as critical for understanding this phenomenon. It seems likely that care-giving in the home and beyond shapes many other practices that carry environmental consequences, suggesting the need for more concerted research on the potential connections between care for humans and care for environment.

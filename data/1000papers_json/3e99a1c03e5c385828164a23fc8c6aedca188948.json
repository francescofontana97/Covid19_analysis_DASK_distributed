Prior recommendations for teleneuropsychological assessment did not consider many of the unique challenges posed by COVID-19. The field is still in need of clear guidelines and standards of care for the assessment of older adults under the current circumstances. Advantages of teleneuropsychological assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic include reduced risk of contracting the virus, eliminating travel time and reducing cost, and more rapid access to needed services. Challenges include disparities in technology access among patients, reduced control over the testing environment, impeded ability to make behavioral observations, and limited research on valid and reliable cognitive assessment measures. The aim of this perspective review is to propose a teleneuropsychological protocol to facilitate neuropsychological assessment utilizing a virtual platform. The proposed protocol has been successful with our clinical and research populations and may help neuropsychologists implement teleneuropsychology services without compromising validity or reliability. However, there is increasing need for research on teleneuropsychological assessment options for both clinical and research purposes.",

The abovementioned issues have been exacerbated for those with dementia, who have an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality (Verity et al., 2020; Williamson et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, affects approximately 5.8 million people in the United States (Alzheimer's Association, 2020). The prodromal stage of AD, coined mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is a symptomatic predementia stage that includes mild yet measurable impairment in memory and other cognitive abilities that exceeds normal aging (Alzheimer's Association, 2020) . Individuals with MCI are at higher risk for progression to dementia making early detection critical. The assessment and treatment of conditions like this, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, have been significantly hampered by the restrictions imposed by COVID-19, resulting in increased reliance on telehealth practices across disciplines. Clinical research operations have been similarly affected.",

In response to the crisis, an advocacy team established by the Interorganizational Practice Committee (IOPC; Bilder et al., 2020) proposed a set of provisional guidelines as the framework for future formal teleneuropsychological guidelines. Teleneuropsychology was defined as the application of audiovisual technologies that allow for remote clinical encounters to conduct neuropsychological evaluations.

Verbal list learning tasks, such as the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (Benedict et al., 1998) , and auditory attention tasks, such as Digit Span (Wechsler, 2008) , are well-suited for remote administration (Hildebrand et al., 2004) . A meta-analysis and systematic review conducted by Brearly et al. (2017) of 497 participants across 12 studies provided support for the use of teleneuropsychology, particularly for verbal tasks, as the difference between in-person and telehealth administration had very modest effect sizes that were not statistically significant. This study supported the use of digit span, list learning, and verbal fluency tasks. With regards to dementia evaluations, various studies, including a rather large one conducted by Cullum et al. (2014) , have supported the validity of teleneuropsychological evaluations in differentiating cognitively unimpaired individuals from those with varying levels of impairment (Wadsworth et al., 2018) .",

Therefore, it is important to ensure that teleneuropsychological administration mimics traditional faceto-face administration as much as possible with appropriate modifications when required. Added/modified instructions are occasionally needed for remote administration of some measures. For example, if the battery includes visual memory tests with copy and delayed recall conditions, it is key to instruct examinees to rip up their drawings in between trials to prevent them from cuing themselves prior to the delayed recall condition. Additionally, following the delayed recall condition, the drawing should be disposed of, to maintain test security. To score figure drawings, we ask examinees to hold up their drawings while we take a screen shot of the entire paper. Capturing all four corners of the page is important, as it allows us to see where figures are placed on the page and how they are rotated. We recommend that the examiner names the file immediately to avoid confusing the different trials later during the scoring process. When administering verbal memory tests, it is important to remind examinees that writing is not allowed prior to the presentation of the stimuli. In our experience, examinees with memory impairment may require this reminder multiple times throughout the evaluation. When assessing for orientation, it is important to instruct examinees to \"look directly into the camera\" to reduce the chance that they will look at a calendar or other external cue.",

For the summary and recommendations sections, providers should consider the American Psychological Association (2020) guidance for telehealth services during COVID-19, which state that no single test score should ever make a clinical decision for psychologists, even under the most optimal conditions. To increase confidence in data interpretation and decision making, consider widening confidence intervals and tapping into the same construct with multiple measures.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, our center has successfully completed 61 teleneuropsychological evaluations with older adults (70% English language and 30% Spanish language) using the outlined protocol. Feedback obtained during debriefing evidenced great acceptance from patients/ participants and a uniformly positive satisfaction with our teleneuropsychological evaluation. Reported advantages include shorter evaluations, more flexibility with appointments, and less worry about virus exposure. Regarding feedback sessions, we have also received very positive feedback with good acceptance from families/patients. An advantage of conducting tele-feedbacks is having family members join the visit from the comfort of their homes, even if they reside at another state. An important limitation for our teleneuropsychology protocol is the lack of formal data analysis and comparison to in office visits. However, the presented protocol is intended to provide a framework for future research. We strongly believe that telemedicine will continue to expand after the COVID-19 pandemic, eventually becoming a modal form of healthcare delivery in certain settings. There is evidence to support the use of this modality which could be of great advantage to older adults who lack transportation, are socially isolated, present with physical impediments, live a great distance from a tertiary medical care center, or are vulnerable to contracting infections in person. As such, it is critical to expand on existing research in order to further validate and refine neuropsychological assessment for teleneuropsychology. Application of insights from computer science and other fields can make virtual assessments as comparable to face-face encounters as possible. Future studies should include larger sample sizes, under-represented populations, and validate a broader range of assessment methods. While existing data appear promising, further studies evaluating the reliability and validity of teleneuropsychology vs. traditional evaluations are required. For now, we recommend that examiners continue to consider evolving research, and the examinee's unique situation, when deciding whether teleneuropsychology should be the preferred method.",

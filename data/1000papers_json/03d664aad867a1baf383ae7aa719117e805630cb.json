Shortly thereafter, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention commenced an investigation into the outbreak. A previously unknown coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) was isolated from respiratory epithelial cells in these patients (2) . Initially confined to Wuhan, the infection has spread elsewhere, with 9720 confirmed cases in China and 106 confirmed cases in other countriesincluding six in the United States as of January 31, 2020 (3,4).",

A bedside chest radiograph obtained 8 days after symptom onset showed bilateral lung consolidation with relative peripheral sparing. A radiograph obtained 3 days later showed more extensive, basal predominant lung consolidation with possible small pleural effusions corresponding to clinical worsening (2) . A second report showed CT images from a single patient who had peripheral, bilateral ground-glass opacity (9) . A different report of six family members with 2019-nCoV lung infection mentions lung opacities present on chest CT scans but lacks details on pattern or distribution aside from ground-glass opacities in an asymptomatic 10-year-old boy (7) . A recent cohort study of 41 patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection included limited analysis of chest imaging studies. All but one patient was reported to have bilateral lung involvement on chest radiographs (8) . Patients admitted to the intensive care unit were more likely to have larger areas of bilateral consolidation on CT scans, whereas patients not requiring admission to the intensive care unit with milder illness were more likely to have ground-glass opacity and small areas of consolidation, the latter description suggesting an organizing pneumonia pattern of lung injury. A study of CT scans of 21 patients with 2019-nCoV infection (10) showed three (21%) with normal CT scans, 12 (57%) with ground-glass opacity only, and six (29%) with ground-glass opacity and consolidation at presentation. Fifteen patients (71%) had two or more lobes involved, and 16 (76%) had bilateral disease. Interestingly, three patients (14%) had normal scans at diagnosis. One of those patients still had a normal scan at short-term follow-up. Seven other patients underwent follow-up CT (range, 1-4 days; mean, 2.5 days); five (63%) had mild progression, and two (25%) had moderate progression.",

Given that up to 30% of patients with 2019-nCoV infection develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (8) , chest imaging studies showing extensive consolidation and ground-glass opacity, typical of acute lung injury, are not unexpected (16, 17) . The longterm imaging features of 2019-nCoV are not yet known but presumably will resemble those of other causes of acute lung injury. As the number of reported cases of 2019-nCoV infection continue to increase, radiologists may encounter patients with this infection. A high index of suspicion and detailed exposure and travel history are critical to considering this diagnosis. In the correct clinical setting, bilateral ground-glass opacities or consolidation at chest imaging should prompt the radiologist to suggest 2019-nCoV as a possible diagnosis. Furthermore, a normal chest CT scan does not exclude the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection.",

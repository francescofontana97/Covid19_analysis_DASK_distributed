COVID-19 is a viral disease that is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has no approved vaccine. The available control measures are non-pharmacological interventions like wearing face masks, social distancing, and lockdown which are being advocated for by the WHO. This work assesses the impact of non-pharmaceutical control measures (social distancing and use of face-masks) and mass testing on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. A community-based transmission model for COVID-19 in Nigeria is formulated with observing social distancing, wearing face masks in public and mass testing. The model is parameterized using Nigeria data on COVID-19 in Nigeria. The basic reproduction number is found to be less than unity( 0 < 1) when the compliance with intervention measures is moderate (50% \u2264 < 70%) and the testing rate per day is moderate (0.5 \u2264 2 < 0.7) or when the compliance with intervention measures is strict ( \u2265 70%) and the testing rate per day is poor ( 2 = 0.3). This implies that Nigeria will be able to halt the spread of COVID-19 under these two conditions. However, it will be easier to enforce strict compliance with intervention measures in the presence of poor testing rate due to the limited availability of testing facilities and manpower in Nigeria. Hence, this study advocates that Nigerian governments (Federal and States) should aim at achieving a testing rate of at least 0.3 per day while ensuring that all the citizens strictly comply with wearing face masks and observing social distancing in public.",

Within four months the country recorded as at July 7, 2020, about 29,286 confirmed cases; 16,804 active cases, 11,828 discharges and 654 deaths [9] . The government of Nigeria implemented various control policies as advocated by the WHO to halt the spread of COVID-19, yet the country is still reporting outrageous new cases daily [9] . These daily new cases have been attributed to either incompatibility of the control measures with Nigerian socioeconomic environment or error on the part of stakeholders [10, 11] . For instance, the enforcement of total or partial lockdown and shutdown of humans and the economies in the entire country especially Lagos state (the most populated and industrial state in the country), Abuja the Federal Capital Territory (the seat of administrative power of the country), Kano (the commercial centre of Northern Nigeria) and Ogun state (another industrial state in southwestern Nigeria) except for essential workers (like Food vendors, the media, healthcare workers, law enforcement agencies, etc) caused a drastic decline in the gross domestic product of the country. Other consequences include; strangulation of small and medium enterprises, increase in crime due to hardship, inflation due to scare resources available and poverty in the country. The attitude of the citizens towards the disease is frustrating the fight of COVID-19 in the country: many people still believe the disease does not kill Africans, some believe that 'COVID-19 is just a scam to enrich some cabal' [11] . Many are still organizing/attending banned public gatherings, while many are still not adhering to basic safety precautions of wearing face-mask and washing of hands with running water or use of hand sanitizers [8, 10, 11] .",

[3] , is one of the very few mathematical models of COVID-19 that seeks to consider the optimal control analysis of some of these control/containment measures advocated by WHO. Their result revealed that the combined implementation of quarantine, isolation and public health education will greatly mitigate the virus if timely implemented. However, the study did not incorporate testing for COVID-19. Iboi et al. [8] presented a mathematical model and analysis of COVID-19 to assess the impact of face-mask in the COVID-19 spread in Nigeria. Their model also revealed that COVID-19 will be eliminated in Nigeria if the wearing of face-mask in public is complemented in Nigeria with a social distancing strategy. Although all the available data on COVID-19 in Nigeria was utilized, the study did not incorporate testing for COVID-19 in their model. Okuonghae and Omane [10] formulated a mathematical model of COVID-19 to assess the impact of non-pharmacological control measures such as social distancing, use of face-mask and case detection (contact tracing and subsequent testing). Their findings revealed that with intensified disease case detection rate and at least 55% of the population adhering to the observance of social distancing and the use of face-mask in public, the disease will eventually die out. However, their model analysis utilized the data on COVID-19 cases in Lagos State alone. While Ibrahim and Ekundayo [11] outlined the importance and the need for mathematical epidemiologists in times such as this, and the general misconstrued perception of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Their findings straightened the wrong perceptions and attitudes of most Nigerians towards the disease, emphasized the need for total adherence to the control/mitigation measures recommended by the government, and also affirmed the needs for mathematical models as the most urgent and necessary tools needed to effectively control/mitigate COVID-19 in Nigeria.",

Poor compliance: < 50% ; ii. Moderate compliance: 50% \u2264 < 70% ; iii. Strict compliance: \u2265 70%. Similarly, we define the testing rate as follows: i. Poor testing rate: 2 < 0.5; ii. Moderate testing rate: 0.5 \u2264 2 < 0.7; iii. High testing rate: 2 \u2265 0.7. Table 2 , the basic reproduction number ( 0 ) for Nigeria is 1.916. This is obtained when the compliance of intervention measures is moderate ( = 50%) and the testing rate is poor. ( 2 = 0.061). In Figure 3 , the numbers in the square boxes are the basic reproduction number values which occur at the intersection of intervention measures, , and the testing rate, 2 . The compliance with intervention measures is represented on the y \u2212 axis while the testing rate is on the x \u2212 axis. The basic reproduction number is greater than unity when the compliance with intervention measures is poor ( < 50%) and the testing rate is high ( 2 \u2265 0.7). However, the basic reproduction number is less than unity( 0 < 1) when the compliance with intervention measures is moderate (50% \u2264 < 70%) and the testing rate is also moderate (0.5 \u2264 2 < 0.7) or when the compliance with intervention measures is strict ( = 70%) and the testing rate is poor ( 2 = 0.3). This implies that Nigeria will be able to halt the spread of COVID-19 under these two conditions. It will be easier to enforce strict compliance with intervention measures compliance in the presence of poor testing rate caused by the limited availability of testing facilities and manpower in Nigeria. On the other hand, poor intervention measures compliance and the high testing rate will not keep the 0 less than unity. Moderate intervention measures and moderate testing rate will be needed for the 0 to be less than unity.",

This is expected as the infected individuals who may have contacted the virus will start treatment immediately especially the isolated asymptomatic infected individuals that have a high probability of early treatment when they develop symptoms. Death may be averted with the early commencement of proper treatment. Figure 6 (a) estimate the number of persons that will be infected when the intervention measures and the testing rates are compared at different values. For instance, when the compliance with intervention measures is poor and the testing rate is poor ( 2 = 0.3), 160,900 persons will be infected in the population. Similarly, when the compliance with intervention measures is poor and the testing rate is moderate ( 2 = 0.5), 34,460 persons will be infected. When the compliance with intervention measures is moderate and the testing rate is poor ( 2 = 0.3), 14,830 persons will also be infected. These conditions support our earlier observation that the basic reproduction number is greater than unity when the compliance with intervention measures is poor ( < 50%) and the testing rate is high ( 2 \u2265 0.7). This implies that COVID-19 will remain in the population unless there is an additional intervention such as vaccination.",

It is also supported by the work of Iboi et al. [8] who reported that COVID-19 can be eliminated in Nigeria if social distancing and face mask compliance were at least moderate. Thus we advocate that based on limited testing facilities and lack of man-power, it will be easier to achieve strict compliance with the intervention measures even under the existing poor testing rate in Nigeria for COVID-19 to be eradicated in the population. Furthermore, Figure 6b showed that the number of dead persons will be reduced regardless of the various intervention measures compliance and testing rate combinations.",

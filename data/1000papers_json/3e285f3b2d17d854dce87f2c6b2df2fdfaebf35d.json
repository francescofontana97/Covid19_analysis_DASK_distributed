            "text": "This paper argues against the dichotomization of pedagogy and technology represented by the widely cited dictum of putting the pedagogical horse before the technology cart. Adopting a complex systems' perspective, it points out that technology and pedagogy are interconnected and interdependent elements of the classroom or learning environment as a system, alongside other elements, including the teacher, the students, the curriculum content, and the physical environment. Any change in one will have an impact on the other, and hence the whole system. Drawing on data from an English language teacher educator's reflections on her journey of adopting online teaching, this paper elucidates the dynamic relationship between technology and pedagogy. It shows how her exploitation of the affordances of technology to simulate face-to-face classroom teaching has led to a re-tooling of these affordances to achieve and re-imagine pedagogical goals. The positive impact on students' self-efficacy and her own self-efficacy in online teaching has led to the emergence of new pedagogical practices and routines which have enabled her to surpass what she could achieve in face-to-face classroom teaching. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance for teachers to embrace technology with an open mind and to understand this complex dynamic relationship for effective online teaching. \u6458\u8981 \u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u91dd\u5c0d\u73fe\u4eca\u5ee3\u6cdb\u88ab\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u540d\u8a00\u2500 \u4ee5\u6559\u5b78\u6cd5\u5f15\u9818\u79d1\u6280\u61c9\u7528\u2500 \u6240\u6307\u51fa\u300c\u6559\u5b78\u6cd5\u300d\u548c\u300c\u79d1 \u6280\u61c9\u7528\u300d\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u6cd5\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u99c1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5f9e\u8907\u96dc\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u89c0\u9ede(complex systems perspective), \u63d0\u51fa",

            "text": "The need to switch from face-to-face (F2F) to online teaching almost overnight due to the outbreak of the pandemic has posed immense challenges to teachers of all subjects and at all levels across the globe. For English language (EL) teachers and teacher educators, the challenges are particularly daunting. The adoption of online teaching often results, or is deemed to result, in mainly one-way communication from the teacher to the students. Even when an online platform is used, interactions between the teacher and the students, and among students, can be constrained by the limitations of technology and teachers' competence in using the technology. Yet, effective teaching in English language teaching (ELT) classrooms should be highly interactive, providing ample opportunities for students to put English into communicative use. Indeed, according to a study conducted by the British Council on Ministries of Education in 52 countries and its online surveys of more than 9600 teachers and teacher educators in 150 countries around the world in April-May 2020, although EL teachers are more likely to be engaged in remote teaching already, the impossibility of F2F interaction has a stronger negative impact on EL teaching than on the teaching of other subjects. The need for parental support in remote learning also presents more difficulties for the former than the latter [7] . This is especially so in non-Englishspeaking countries in which parents of working class children do not speak the target language.",

The dictum that \"pedagogy is the driver and technology is the accelerator\" often appears in discussions on the role of technology in education, and teachers have been advised by education experts to put pedagogy before technology (see, for example, [2] ). Along similar lines, the analogy of the cart and the horse has been drawn on to describe the relationship between technology and pedagogy. Based on the tendency of many teachers to choose a tool because they like its features and then try to fit the pedagogy into the tool, Sankey [9] argues that the \"pedagogical horse\" should be put in front of the \"technological cart\" and not the other way round (p. 46). That is, teachers should decide on the pedagogical approach(es) that they wish to adopt and through that lens choose the technology tools that will support the chosen approaches.",

As a growing number of scholars have pointed out, the classroom is a system of connected and interdependent elements, and the interactions among these elements change the structures of this system (see for example [1, 12] ), as well as its elements. From a complex systems' perspective, as Larsen-Freeman [6] asserts, \"(T)he components [of the classroom] are not only the agents, that is, the teacher and the students (and all of their accompanying thoughts, embodied actions, emotions, behaviors, dispositions, identities, social capital, etc.), but they also include properties of the physical and temporal environment as well.\" (p. 378). She further notes that the interactions among these comprising components are often characterized by \"emergence\" which is \"the arising of something new, often unanticipated, from the interaction of components which comprise it.\" (ibid.). Technology and pedagogy are essential components of the system and interactions between them are dynamic: as technology supports or facilitates a certain pedagogical approach, the latter is often re-shaped, or re-imagined, if you will, leading to the emergence of new pedagogical approaches or practices. Conversely, the adaptation of technology for a certain pedagogical approach often involves re-tooling technology for purposes different from what it was initially designed for, leading to the emergence of a new tool over time. (Witness the rapid emergence of new technologies in recent decades which have revolutionized our lives. See [3] .) In other words, the dynamic interactions between technology and pedagogy will result in changes in other components, not least the teacher's teaching and students' learning and all their accompanying psychological states, including motivation, self-efficacy, and anxiety, and hence the whole system.",

Much of the discussion on online teaching has centered on how technology can be used to simulate teaching in the everyday classroom. Many educators subscribe to the view that the more online teaching can simulate physical classroom teaching, the more effective online learning is, the reason being students are used to F2F teaching in a physical setting. Nicole was no exception. Prior to COVID-19, she had never conducted online teaching. She struggled hard to learn how to use an online platform and had to seek help from her academic and technical colleagues. Both she and her students were worried that they would be deprived of the opportunities to interact and to engage fully with each other. She started off with exactly the same belief that she should as much as possible replicate her teaching in a physical classroom, which is highly interactive and engaging. Therefore, in her search for online platforms and tools, Nicole focused on those that would give her students the best possible learning experience.",

Students appear on the screen in separate boxes. Whether they feel the presence of everyone in class depends on whether they choose the \"speaker view\" or the \"gallery view.\" Some students prefer the speaker view so as to follow everything that the teacher says in the clearest manner. Other than this, physical proximity, spontaneous verbal and nonverbal responses, all of which are ever present in a physical classroom, would be limited to what is displayed on each participant's screen. The interaction could easily become a unidirectional exchange between the teacher and the student. To recreate a collective presence and to remind them that they are a learning community, Nicole encouraged her students to show their faces on the screen (allowing students who are reluctant to do that to use an Avatar), to greet each other at the beginning of class, after a break and at the end of class. She also made frequent reference to students, using their names, in order to remind the class of each other's presence. Her students were highly appreciative of this strategy and a number of messages she received indicated that she had brought them much closer together despite the physical distance.",

She has always tried to encourage every student to participate in class by utilizing different response formats like giving non-verbal answers such as using thumbs up/thumbs down or red/ green cards to express agreement or disagreement before inviting verbal elaborations, and by allowing them to think and rehearse their ideas with their peers before presenting them to the rest of the class. Despite these techniques, voices are often left unheard due to students' anxiety and time limit.",

Unlike Collaborate Board where the platform host controls the identities of the authors of the Post-it notes, Chat provides two options for all participants: either to post the comments publicly, using the \"everyone\" function, or privately, using the \"private\" function. When Nicole found out about this functionality, she immediately thought about how to re-tool this functionality for accessing the views of reticent students. She made both options available to students. Those who were less confident or who would prefer sharing an idea with her first could use the \"private\" function. This allowed her to acknowledge these students' contributions, give them a word of encouragement, and urge them in \"private\" to share their ideas with the rest of the class either in writing or verbally. For some sensitive topics such as those involving personal information in \"private\" chats, Nicole would invite students who were ready to share their ideas or feelings with the class to put an asterisk next to their response.",

These students often choose to clarify their doubts after class, which is a common practice among Asian students. For Nicole, this would be a missed opportunity for whole-class co-construction of knowledge.",

Nicole monitored closely the contributions from students on Chat and she invited those who had sent in interesting and unique comments to share them in public. The invitation from Nicole assured the students that their comments were worthwhile contributions. This kind of endorsement is very important for highly anxious and diffident students. Over time, thoughts which were sent privately to Nicole gradually appeared in public chats. Students became more ready to interact with their peers publicly, often resulting in extensive discussions on a topic or issue on Chat. Leveraging on this, Nicole further helped students overcome oral communication anxiety by inviting those who sent in well-articulated and thoughtful written responses to elaborate on their comments orally. Jumping over this hurdle is non-trivial, as we can see from the following private message to Nicole from one of the students, Terry, who is one among many who had chosen the \"private\" option initially.",

In other words, her existing pedagogical approaches and practices were driving her exploration and selection of technology tools. In searching for these tools, she became aware of their potential to bring about more effective teaching. In her reflections, she wrote, I am no techno-wizard. I am simply open to new teaching ideas, eager to try out novelties, and ready to challenge myself to think out of the box, and let my creativity and knowledge of my students guide me in thinking about what I could do to bring out the very best in my students.",

This re-tooling led to the emergence of a new pedagogical routine in which eliciting comments from every student and getting them to respond to each other's comments permeates all her lessons, a routine that would not have been possible without the affordances of technology. It also led to the emergence of a lesson design which is typified by the provision for students to express their views privately, with little anxiety, until they are ready to make them public. Such practices have made a significant impact on students' participation and motivation. This in turn made Nicole feel \"very energized, motivated, and pleased\" when she realized \"how many more voices I'm (she's) hearing in every single lesson via Zoom and different kinds of digital tools\". Consequently, her online teaching self-efficacy increased dramatically and the recognition she received from teaching awards and invitations to give workshops to university, faculty, and school teachers spurred her pursuit of teaching excellence.",

They further observe that teachers not only need to have knowledge of technology, pedagogy, and content, but more importantly to understand the complexities of the dynamic relationship among these three components, the lack of which will lead to \"oversimplified solutions or failures\" (p. 65). Nicole's journey from a novice to an award-winner of online teaching, and from replicating to surpassing F2F classroom teaching, fully illustrates this dynamic relationship. For teachers who are averse to, or apprehensive about, the use of technology in teaching, Nicole's journey also illustrates that it is in the process of engaging with technology with an open mind that teachers can begin to appreciate how technology can be effectively used not only to achieve pedagogical goals but also to reimagine new pedagogical goals. It also shows how technology can be adopted, and often is, re-tooled to serve pedagogical goals.",

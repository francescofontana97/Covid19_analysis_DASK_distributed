            "text": "Background: Care guidelines for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) recommend an integrated approach for holistic, flexible, and tailored interventions. Continuity of care is also emphasised. However, many patients with COPD experience fragmented care. Discontinuities in healthcare and related social services are likely to result in disjointed rather than integrated care which can negatively affect patient health outcomes. The purpose of this qualitative study was to improve our understanding of, and how, contextual features pertaining to structures and processes of COPD integrated care influence delivery of care within patients' healthcare networks. Methods: We conducted individual interviews with 28 participants (9 patients, 16 healthcare professionals, and 3 spousal caregivers). Participants were recruited through the lung clinic at a city hospital in western Canada. We employed a social network paradigm to analyse and interpret the data. Results: The analysis revealed an overarching theme of fragmented COPD care with two sub-themes: (1) Funding shortfalls and availability of resources, and (2) Dis(mis)connected communication pathways. The overarching theme depicts variations, delays, and discontinuities in patient care. The sub-themes describe how macro level influences and meso level shortfalls were perceived to influence the availability of respiratory care resources that contributed to fragmented COPD care. Conclusions: Employing a social network lens drew particular attention to family physicians' pivotal role in delivering community-based COPD care. While an integrated approach to care is recommended by care guidelines, institutional and organizational structures and processes, such as financial and communication structures, may inhibit delivery of integrated care. Thus, macro and meso level structures and processes have the potential to shape patient care by constraining family physicians' purposive and communication actions necessary for facilitating an integrated distributed approach to care. We propose a context of care which fosters a context for family physicians' delivery of patient-centered care. Integrated care delivery may improve patients' wellbeing and alleviate financial constraints on the healthcare system.",

The term can be used, for example, to describe managed care, continuity of care, patient-centered care, and or integrated delivery systems [7, 8] . Integrated care also considers organizational and professional aspects of a healthcare delivery system [8] . In relation to patient care, integrated care more often relates to collaboration between various healthcare practices, such as family physician, respiratory specialist, therapist, pharmaceutical, and pulmonary rehabilitation services, that are necessary to treat and manage COPD [7, 9] . Integrated care with these collaborative characteristics has been shown to improve patient health outcomes, particularly with respect to decreased exacerbations and hospitalization [11, 12] . At the organizational level, integrated care refers to the organizations and services that deliver healthcare, such as health authorities and private service providers, and is thought to reduce healthcare costs [9] [10] [11] .",

Furthermore, current guidelines for integrated COPD management, such as patient education and managing exacerbations, may not be widely implemented [9] . Some speculate that this may, in part, be due to varying perceptions of integrated care between different stakeholders (patients, their healthcare team members, and health organizations), and across and within different care settings [8, 13, 17] . In addition, a diversity of care settings, and healthcare structures and processes suggest that a universal model of integrated COPD care is unlikely and fraught with challenges [7] .

Within the conceptual landscape of social network analysis, communication (flow of information) and purposive action (flow of resources) merge forming a foundation for network cooperation [19] . Within social networks, sets of ties link various actors and allow for or block the flow of information and resources between actors [24] . In the present analysis, we define patients' healthcare networks as being egocentric. An egocentric network is based on patients, their selected healthcare providers, and the structures and processes in which interactions occur in the context of COPD care. Egocentric social networks are not isolated from other social networks [24, 26] . For instance, patients' COPD healthcare networks are interwoven with organisational (e.g., healthcare professional organizations) and institutional networks (e.g., healthcare authorities). Organization and institutional networks frame egocentric social networks [19] .

For the parent study we used a purposive sampling strategy to recruit COPD patients and members of their healthcare networks in a two phased process. Patients were recruited through the hospital lung clinic in a large urban area in western Canada. SA was invited to visit the clinic to describe the study and provide consent packages to interested patients and caregivers. We conducted semistructured, in-depth interviews with all participants which lasted between 30 and 90 min. SA conducted face-to-face interviews with all patient participants. During the interviews, each patient was asked to name at least 3 members of their healthcare network [27] . With patients' permission, SA contacted and invited patients' healthcare network members to participate in the study. These participants were interviewed separately by phone or in person by SA. In total, for the parent study, we recruited 10 patients, 19 healthcare providers, and 3 spousal caregivers for a total sample of 32 participants. All interviews were audio recorded and SA also provided field notes. The interview protocol was designed to promote discussion around healthcare network members and their role in providing patient care, communication, and relationships with other network members. Patients were identified as team (network) members in the parent study and the interview questions were posed to all participants. For example, \"When a problem comes up how do you communicate with the other team members?\" When, patients were asked \"Who is on your healthcare team?\", healthcare team members were asked \"Who is on the patient's healthcare team?\" The recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim, and anonymized. For this secondary data analysis, we drew on participant data from 9 patients, their 16 healthcare providers, and three spousal caregivers for a total sample of 28 participants. The data from one patient and their team was excluded as this patient received institutionalised care in a longterm care facility rather than in the community.",

Pattern analysis involved a process of comparison, contrast, and integration which led to organizing items together in higher order patterns. For instance, patterns were identified around patients' experience accessing care and of continuity of care. Structural analysis involved bringing together pieces of an analytic puzzle to create an overall structural insight of the phenomena under exploration [28] . During structural analysis, we incorporated many initial codes and developed theoretically informed themes that drew on social network theory [19, 24] .

In particular, improving access to specialists, decreasing specialist consultation wait times, and providing adequate respiratory therapists across health authorities were highlighted by participants as significant structural changes that could improve access to care. Furthermore, our insights, which support the literature [6, 13, 30] suggest family physicians may not have the time, or access to resources, to adequately address the complex needs of COPD patients and support patient selfmanagement. People with COPD require respiratory therapy, smoking cessation education [31] , and anxiety management [32] . Furthermore, COPD often has to be managed along with other complex co-morbidities [1, 4, 6] . Selfmanagement education, which includes pulmonary rehabilitation, is a key component of COPD care, and has been associated with decreased hospital admissions due to exacerbations [1, 2, 6] . Our findings resonate with the literature which suggest changes to organizational (e.g., financial) structures that allow family physicians time for addressing the needs of complex patients [10] , along with access to essential COPD resources required to implement guidelines [30] , may better support integrated care.",

Communication pathways that support information flow between network members are essential linkages within social networks [19, 24] . These linkages refer to both individual network member communication behaviour/characteristics and network structures which promote or inhibit transfer of information [24] . In particular, the rate and reliability of network decisions can be affected not only by geographic distance, but also by varied communication structures (e.g., electronic medical records) [24] . The varied disconnected communication modes used by different community members in our study contributed to delays and discontinuity of care. This was particularly evident for patient transfer from hospital to community, and potentially resulted in a fragmented approach to care. A common communication system that links healthcare professionals would enable flow and sharing of information and knowledge around patients' needs and improve decision making [35] . A shared communication system may also expedite referrals and report sharing, and reduce clinical office management costs [34, 35] . Despite these potential benefits of shared communication systems, the uptake of a unified electronic communication system appears to be elusive. As identified in our study and the literature, clinical locale (e.g. hospitals and clinics) [10, 33, 34] use a variety of medical record systems. Moreover, medical services (e.g., drug and diagnostic information) [36] also use different electronic systems. These electronic systems are often incompatible: a considerable organizational barrier to integrated communication. Differences in information organization of various clinical groups along with hierarchical structures that are invariably present also inhibit integrated communication [33] .",

Individual networks are not isolated from other personal or organizational networks [19] . Thus, it is important to recognise that distributed care should not be dissociated from hospital care, or social culture practices and policies [37] .

However, the advent of COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of telemedicine [39] . Telemedicine may possibly enhance integrated care [14, 16] and is an area for future research. Finally, we were unable to recruit all healthcare network members identified by patients. Thus, our analysis may not reflect the experiences of complete networks. In addition, this analysis focused only on the organizational and structural components of healthcare networks. We recognize the importance of network member interactions, power relations, and hierarchical structures shaping participating health professionals' collaborations. These insights are to be reported separately by our research team. We also recognize the importance of interactions between different healthcare networks. Some patients mentioned other medical conditions during their interviews. The data was not sufficient to draw any conclusions regarding how other co-occurring disease management networks interfaced with and/or contributed to COPD care. Exploring how co-occurring disease management networks interface is an important area for future search which can contribute to understanding the complexities of chronic disease management. Despite these limitations, this secondary data analysis has identified gaps in organizational structures which provide opportunities for further exploration and research. For instance, given that many people with COPD experience hospitalization due to exacerbations and disease progression [2, 6] ) identifying structures and processes that support institutional COPD care is an important area for future research.",

We also explored the challenges of delivering integrated care. We identified diverse patient healthcare networks, and the influence of macro level (broader healthcare system, and meso level (organizational)) structures and shortfalls. Through a social network lens our findings highlighted family physicians' pivotal role in delivering community-based COPD care. Our insights emphasize that while an integrated approach to care is recommended by care guidelines, institutional and organizational structures and processes, such as financial and communication structures, may inhibit delivery of integrated care. Moreover, macro and meso level structures and processes have the potential to shape patient care by constraining family physicians' purposive and communication actions necessary for facilitating an integrated distributed approach to care. We propose a context of care that is specific to distributed integrated care and which is supported by macro and meso level structures which facilitate family physicians' delivery of patient-centered care. Improving efficacy of care has the potential to improve patients' wellbeing and alleviate healthcare system financial constraints. ",

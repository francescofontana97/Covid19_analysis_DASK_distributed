When the cornea is diseased or damaged irreversibly, a corneal transplant may be necessary to restore its function. Penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) is a full thickness transplant procedure that replaces a diseased cornea with the donor cornea, requiring a trephination of the patient's cornea, followed by placement of a full-thickness donor corneal graft. In general, about sixteen interrupted sutures are placed radially around the edge of the cornea. Proper corneal suturing is needed to make an appropriate connection of the recipient with the donor cornea and avoid irregular surgical-induced astigmatism. If the suture depth is too thick, it can penetrate the cornea, which causes corneal endothelial cell loss. On the contrary, if the suture depth is too shallow, the anterior tissues of the recipient and the donor cornea cannot make appropriate wound strength. This incomplete wound construction causes wound leaks and irregular astigmatism [1] [2] [3] .",

First, the surgeon inserts one tip of the forceps between the boundary of the patient eye and the donor cornea. The surgeon moves the forceps to locate the forceps' tip at the target depth, which should fall just anterior to the Descemet's membrane, which is about 90% of corneal thickness. When the surgeon thinks the forceps tip is located at the proper depth, the surgeon grasps the corneal using the forceps. A suture needle is inserted just below the forceps tip to generate a suture with target depth after grasping. Therefore, accurately grasping the cornea using forceps is key to proper suture placement.",

First, transparency, softness, and thinness of the cornea make the surgeon challenging to figure out the current forceps depth. Second, a human's natural hand tremor makes positioning of the forceps difficult. Even if the surgeon knows the forceps' exact depth, positioning the forceps at that depth is challenging because of hand tremors. When humans hold the medical tool, the amplitude of hand tremors can be up to 200 \u00b5m [4] . The effect of hand tremor is critical in PKP because the corneal thickness is very thin, about 550 \u00b5m. As a consequence, only very skilled surgeons can perform accurate suturing in PKP.",

The device is a hand-held type; therefore, we expect that the device has benefits of easy usage and a short learning curve compared to the robot system. The proposed device consists of two parts: a sensing part and an actuating part. The sensing part detects the moment of the device's tip reaching the target depth. The actuation part automatically grasps the corneal tissue when the sensor is activated. The actuation part was designed to grasp the corneal as fast as possible, minimizing the effect of human hand tremors. The concept of the sensorembedded forceps was firstly proposed in the previous conference paper [12] . However, the limitation was that there was no verification of the device's suturing performance through experiment, and the device was not made of biocompatible material. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, the device's suturing performance was analyzed by conducting a suturing experiment on multiple porcine corneas. The device's suturing performance is compared to that of the control group, suturing without the device. Second, the proposed device is made of biocompatible material. Therefore, the paper shows the possibility of using the device in actual surgery. In addition, the structure and the fabrication process of the device are fully introduced.",

To generate suture with the device, the surgeon slowly inserts the device's tip between the recipient side cornea and the donor side cornea. When the device's depth is less than the target suture depth, the two electrodes are electrically disconnected. When the device reaches the target suture depth, the corneal tissue is connected to both the first and second electrodes. Now the two electrodes are electrically connected through the corneal tissue.

After the coating, the Parylene coating around the forceps tip is partially removed. Parylene is known as a biocompatible material, which is used in several medical applications, including ophthalmology [13, 14] . The second electrode, which is attached to the forceps' surface, is fabricated by cutting a thin stainless steel 316L sheet from Nilaco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan. The thickness of the stainless steel is 20 \u00b5m. The stainless steel sheet must be precisely cut to be attached to the complex-shaped forceps body. The stainless steel sheet is cut using a paper cutter Cameo 4 pro, Silhouette Korea, Seoul, Korea. The final stainless steel electrode is illustrated in Figure 2 . The first and second electrodes are biocompatible because stainless steel is a well-known biocompatible material. The one end of the electrode is cut with relatively large space, and an electric wire is attached using silver epoxy. After the stainless steel electrode is fabricated, it is attached to the forceps body using epoxy. The distance between the first electrode and the second electrode is set to 500 \u00b5m. ",

The porcine cornea was put in the cornea holder, which is made by rapid prototyping. Total eight porcine corneas were used in the experiment. For each cornea, two sutures were made using the proposed automatic grasping device. On the same cornea, two sutures were made using traditional toothed forceps for comparison. Therefore, sixteen sutures were generated using the proposed device, and sixteen sutures were generated using the traditional toothed forceps. In the experiment, needle insertion was done manually using a needle holder from Rumex, Florida, USA, 8-024T. After suturing, the cornea is moved to the microscopic stand, and the suture depth was measured using microscope DinoLite, New Taipei City, Taiwan, AM7915MZT. All sutures were made on the donor side cornea to accurately move and image the cornea's side surface. The result of measuring suture depth is shown in Figure 7 and Table 3 . The corneal thickness of 550 \u00b5m was assumed, and the target suture depth was designed to be 500 \u00b5m (90% of thickness). The mean suture depth generated using the proposed device was 447.1 \u00b5m, 81.3% of corneal thickness. This depth lies in the empirically reported safety boundary [15] . There may be several reasons why the depth is shallower than the target depth. First, the eye's wet condition might connect the two electrodes before the device reaches the target depth. The device detects the moment of reaching the target depth by measuring the two electrodes' electrical connections. When the second electrode is near the cornea's top surface, moisture on the cornea can wet the second electrode. Since eye fluid is conductive, two electrodes will be electrically connected, and the device will misjudge the contact moment. The second reason for shallower depth might be an error induced by wrong needle insertion. After the device grasps the cornea, the operator manually inserts the needle just below the device tip. However, a human error can occur in this step which causes larger or smaller suture depth. Figure 7 . Box plot of the suture depth generated from the proposed device and manual suture. For each method, sixteen sutures were generated. With the device, there was one outlier (calculated with 1.5 IQR). Excluding the outlier, the median, maximum, and minimum suture depths were 477, 534, and 362 \u00b5m. Without the device, the median, maximum, and minimum suture depths were 461.5, 1157, and 311 \u00b5m. The standard deviation of the sutures from the proposed device was 85.8 \u00b5m, which is smaller than that from the manual suturing, 221.6 \u00b5m. There is an outlier in the result from the proposed device, which is 747 \u00b5m. The outlier can be because of two reasons. First, the device might not be inserted in contact with the cornea but suddenly come into contact with a deep insertion depth. The device's surface must contact the cornea from the beginning of the insertion to properly detect the insertion depth. If not, the second electrode's first contact with the corneal tissue can happen deeper. The second reason for the outlier is wrong needle insertion after the grasping. The operator manually inserts the needle, and this can induce an error in the suture depth.",

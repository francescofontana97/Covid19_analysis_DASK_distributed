The increasing production of nonbiodegradable materials is inevitably going to affect the world we live in. This article highlights the importance of developing new and sustainable methods of vaccination and disposal, while mentioning some initiatives that are already in place to combat this issue. Along with educating the unaware proportion of the population, there is a need to develop sustainable and recyclable products for a better tomorrow. Questions arise on how nations will protect environment from an increasingly large volume of medical waste -including non-biodegradable plastic syringes. Are there more efficient and safe ways to dispose of the billions of plastic syringes which will soon be used in mass vaccination campaigns? How can we overcome this pandemic while effectively preserving the environment?",

Borosilicate glass is the most widely used packaging material and has been used for over a century. The WHO has laid down guidelines regarding various aspects of packaging on international level of distribution, such as storage volume. According to WHO, each international shipping carton should weigh less than 50 kg. More amount of packaging means more expenditure, more material used and increased difficulty in its disposal. Some companies like DS Smith already put in place sustainable, temperature-controlled, multi-material thermal insulation packages. 4 The use of paper and renewable plant components is also a sustainable alternative to disposable plastic and EPS foam (expanded polystyrene), which is difficult to recycle and is used in more than 350,000 tons of packaging annually. Moreover, the change of EPS foam ClimaCell\u00ae is able to reduce by 65% the carbon emissions. 5",

Syringes are a main component in vaccine packs, which are usually made of either plastic, glass or stainless steel. Usually, the plastic that is used to produce syringes is Polypropylene. Although Polypropylene is safe and recyclable, only around 1% is recycled and most of it is headed for the landfill. 9 Above that, it is non-biodegradable which raises serious environmental issues. Toxic additives in Polypropylene such as lead and cadmium add to the problem, as upon incineration, these release poisonous dioxins and vinyl chloride. To avoid such emissions, the concept of pre-filled syringes created by Cambridge Consultants should be adopted.",

However, in practice, although healthcare companies liked the idea of Syreen, they were reluctant in its applicability, due to the consequent need to change their filling lines. 13 Finally, with regard to responsibility, manufacturer responsibility lies in ensuring procurement of vaccines by reviewing design layout and infrastructure and providing adequate training on evolving sustainable manufacturing practices, quality management systems and the WHO prequalification process. On the other hand, user responsibility includes strong government support, community engagement and work by healthcare workers ensuring safe disposal practices. 14 The government is urged to incentivise the process of vaccine manufacturing and use by introducing subsidies, refund of indirect taxes, concessional duty on import of capital goods and income tax exemption.

Failure to properly dispose off the needles, after use, eventually leads to needle prick injuries and puts the victim in harm's way or even a possible contraction of diseases like HIV & HBV. 7 To minimize the occurrence of such incidences, either seminars should be conducted from time to time, training the medical or the cleaning staff to practice the systematic approach to dispose off the needles after use or dedicated initiatives should be taken up by companies or a group of people willing to volunteer. For example, in 2011, an US based company, named Becton, Dickinson, and Co. & Waste Management announced an agreement to recycle needles, syringes and other sharps used in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. They launched BD ecoFinityTM Life Cycle Solution, which would find an innovative way to recycle the medical sharps waste and make new products with the material. 3 In 2012, according to Ranjeet Banerjee, vice president and general manager of BD's Medical Surgical Systems unit, the initiative wasquickly accepted by BD's customers, and in just one year, it managed to collect more than 454 tons of waste , and part of this recycled plastic was used in the manufacture of new sharps collection containers.8",

A hike in patients led to the drastic production of medical waste. COVID-19 vaccines being approved worldwide, has re-established hope. While clinical trials suggest that these vaccines' potential adverse effects are mild, they have not addressed the implications of mass vaccination campaigns on climate.",

On the other hand, we believe that there are several major drawbacks that need to be addressed.",

Previously, Ozkan et al reported regarding the safety and efficacy of TT regimens with low-dose and slow infusion tissue plasminogen activator [2] . The 2020 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease now recommends urgent initial treatment with either slow-infusion low-dose TT or emergency surgery for obstructive PVT as first-line treatment strategies with class I-B indications [3] . The most obvious problem with this case report is already evident in the abstract is that anticoagulation is preferred, although the recommendations for major cardiovascular guidelines thrombolytic therapy are clear. Perhaps the authors can explain the reasons for not applying TT or surgical therapy.",

The effectiveness of anticoagulation in the treatment of PVT was based on data from a limited number of publications. It has been reported that the prognosis for a small asymptomatic thrombus (length <10 mm) is favorable with optimization of anticoagulant therapy [2, 3] . Recently, we reported that the success rate of anticoagulation therapy containing heparin in patients with PVT was 46.8% [4] . The readers may wonder why anticoagulation with the low success rate was preferred to the treatment of PVT over TT, whose effectiveness and safety has been proven by numerous studies.",

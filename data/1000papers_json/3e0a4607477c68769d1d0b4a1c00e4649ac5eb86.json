We build on work mapping the emergent landscape of corporate AI ethics to center one outcome of these conversations: the incorporation of diversity and inclusion in corporate AI ethics activities. Using interpretive document analysis and analytic tools from the values in design field, we examine how diversity and inclusion work is articulated in public-facing AI ethics documentation produced by three companies that create application and services layer AI infrastructure: Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce.",

The focus on technical artifacts -such as diverse and inclusive datasets -and the replacement of equity with fairness make ethical work more actionable for everyday practitioners. Yet, they appear divorced from broader DEI initiatives and relevant subject matter experts that could provide needed context to nuanced decisions around how to operationalize these values and new solutions. Finally, diversity and inclusion, as configured by engineering logic, positions firms not as \"ethics owners\" but as ethics allocators; while these companies claim expertise on AI ethics, the responsibility of defining who diversity and inclusion are meant to protect and where it is relevant is pushed downstream to their customers.",

From evaluations of gender and racial bias in new technologies such as IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon's facial recognition tools [14, 58] and search result algorithms for Google images [42] , to studies of algorithmic decisionmaking reproducing or exacerbating structural discrimination in historically inequitable areas such as health [51] , employment [18] , and freedom [7] , these examples shape academic and public discourse around AI ethics. One response to this range of harms has been the rise of AI ethics initiatives in both the public and private sector. In particular, AI ethics initiatives are proliferating in high-profile private sector firms that provide the infrastructure for AI work. These firms have produced a growing set of public facing documents, including but not limited to principles documents [5, 40] . In light of the various discriminatory outcomes data intensive products and services can produce and existing corporate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, it is unsurprising that diversity and inclusion appear in public-facing corporate AI ethics documents; although not as first order principles, but often in support of fairness [40] .",

Researchers have documented AI-related shifts including: existing corporate subject matter experts taking on new responsibilities to avoid AI-related harms [35] ; the emergence of new professional roles to \"own\" ethics in corporate practice [35, 44, 46] ; and the adoption of new institutional structures [50] . The work of individual firms is situated within a broader set of activities aimed at addressing ethics in AI practice and AI-driven systems including the adoption of professional codes of conduct (e.g. ACM, 1 DSA, 2 Data Science 3 ); new subfields in computer science and supporting structures such as conferences (e.g. FAccT, MD4SG AIES); new educational initiatives to bring attention to the social, political, legal and ethical implications of technical systems into computer science, and data science courses [25] ; funding initiatives to encourage research and educational emphasis on the ethical implications of AI (e.g. NSF FAI 4 ); new standards (e.g.IEEE Ethically Aligned Design); public policy initiatives attending to the values embedded in algorithmic systems used by government [47] ; as well as government bans and limitations on the use of specific AI technologies in the policing context [17] . There has been an explosion of ethical AI principles statementsinternational, national, industry wide, firm-specific, and multistakeholder-and analysis of them. These high-level documents shed light on how the field, and distinct actors within it, are discursively framing and theorizing the goals of AI ethics work. While researchers have found significant overlap in the conceptual coverage of AI ethics principles statements, they've noted some discontinuities in the coverage and framing between corporate, and government or multi-stakeholder principles [26, 28, 40] . Analysis of these principle statements are a useful starting point to explore the work AI ethics is enlisted to do by various actors.",

Scholars have raised questions about the ability of companies' ethics efforts to address the ethical wrongs due to conflicts with underlying Silicon Valley logics of \"market fundamentalism, meritocracy, and technological solutionism\" [44] .

These terms while distinct, tend to travel together: diversity is focused on the representation of different group affiliations of cultural significance, inclusion is centered on members of groups being included in key decision-making, and equity is the absence of systemic disparities across distinct groups [12] . Ruha Benjamin has flagged diversity and inclusion as a kind of \"happy talk\" that acknowledges cultural difference without challenging structural inequalities [10] . Sareeta Amrute notes that the corporate embrace of diversity at once makes things like racial diversity visible and celebrated, while also underplaying or obscuring the broader historical and political dynamics that inform systems of racial difference [6] . Along a similar vein, Anna Lauren Hoffman discusses how inclusion in data technologies, if not accompanied by shifts in power, can further vulnerability to \"data violence\" by normalizing otherwise oppressive structural conditions [36] . As Devin Guillory points out in his discussion of anti-Blackness in AI communities, diversity is often valued only insofar as it is seen as improving corporate performance-a \"predatory view. . . in which the worth of underrepresented people is tied to their value add to ingroup members\" [31] . In this way, Anna Lauren Hoffmann claims, diversity and inclusion in data science and technology largely represent \"an ethics of social change that does not upset the social order\" [36] .",

Edelman, Sally Riggs Fuller, and Iona Mara-Drita [24] found that diversity management rhetoric diluted the aims of civil rights law by expanding beyond legally protected categories to include thought, lifestyle, culture, dress, geography among others, thus distancing diversity from the goals and logics of civil rights laws, and aligning it with corporate success rather than ameliorating specific discriminatory harms. More recently, Ellen Berrery documents a shift away from civil rights in corporate statements around diversity which now talk about diversity in business products, and position diversity as instrumental in global business expansion and success rather than responsive to histories of oppression and exclusion [13] . Edelman argues that \"(t)he rhetorical transformation from civil rights to diversity\" replaced \"the public commitment to minority hiring, and in particular to the hiring of black Americans. . . \" with a \"commitment to diversity-a construct that is almost universally accepted as valuable and yet does little to promote race and gender equality in the workplace\" [23] .",

They rank among the most influential technology firms globally. Combined, their enterprise cloud services constitute a large portion of the market for enterprise cloud and data analytics services. 5 These firms are highly engaged with regulators and policymakers considering whether and how to regulate AI to protect public values, Given the ongoing ambiguity of the external policy environment, the discursive practices and organizational choices of these influential players are primed to shape the field as other firms seeking to signal legitimate and responsible behavior to external stakeholders follow their example-a process of mimetic isomorphism [19] . These firms are also shaping the research agenda of ethical AI through publications, participation in scholarly communities, and financial support. The numerous sites of interaction between corporate AI ethics professionals and the broader emerging AI ethics field, and the relative wealth of AI ethics approaches emerging from these firms-both their practice and research groups-create an environment where corporate practitioners are likely to play an influential role in diffusing concepts, policies and practices across firms and into the broader field [8] . This is not to say that these companies can wholly determine understandings and practices -their own or others -but rather to acknowledge the relative potential influence of these documents on the emerging field of ethical AI. We initially sought to include Amazon in our corpus, but a lack of documents about AI ethics made it infeasible to include the company in our analysis.",

In Foucauldian terms, discourse as a term is used more specifically to describe the (historically-bound) rules and assumptions that make knowledge possible. It simultaneously reflects and shapes social orders and practices, informing both what people do in practice and how people understand and represent those practices at any given time [61] . In this way, discourse is not reducible to a practice or a representation; instead, discourse is a kind of mediating layer that enables the successful accomplishment of either. If discourse is defined as the recontextualization of social practices, and knowledge is produced at one level and then embedded into another, where it is made to serve contextually-defined goals or purposes [61] , analyses of discourse take up and scrutinize representations in the form of texts as sites where discursive rules and assumptions are encoded.",

While the objects of study are sociotechnical systems, where to draw the boundaries of such a system, and where and how to study values in relation to it are ambiguous and contested [57] . Similarly, the contested and contextual nature of values such as privacy, fairness, transparency, etc. complicates efforts to study values in existing sociotechnical systems, and importantly for the work of AI ethics, to build to support them. To address these challenges, researchers have developed frameworks that clarify various ways to see and position values in relation to sociotechnical systems [49, 57] , and analytic tools to unpack and model contested values [27, 48, 49 ].",

Diversity is positioned as instrumental to achieving product or business objective, such as products that serve diverse markets. Inclusiveness is viewed as instrumental to democratizing AI and building customer trust, and producing better business insights. The lack of specificity and clarity about the purpose and justification of diversity and inclusion work, and deference to customer preferences, further distances ethical AI work from the equitable aims of civil and human rights laws, and, as we discuss below, places it largely outside the firms' responsibility. But the drift takes new forms. First, technical artifacts, not just humans, become a locus of diversity and inclusion work. The new emphasis on diversity and inclusion of non-human subjects -datasets, use cases, etc. -is surely necessary to advance equitable outcomes in AI systems.

The extent of such influence is uncertain, however the lack of clarity and guidance coming from external actors suggests it could be substantial. First, where the expectations of external stakeholders are unclear, firms mimic the structures of their peers in an effort to signal legitimacy and rationality, a process of \"institutional isomorphism\" [19] . Second, as firms adopt policies, processes, and structures to symbolize attention to the ethics of AI, those structures may become equated with responsible action and shape understandings of compliance, and over time regulators and other legal actors may take their mere existence as evidence of legality [24] . This entanglement with the law [23] raises questions about the potential implications of the reconfigurations of diversity and inclusion in these corporate documents for the firms'-and over time, legal actors' and institutions'-understanding of what civil rights law requires of those who develop and deploy AI systems. Is it necessary, appropriate, sufficient to substitute terms tractable to technical systems (skin tone, geographic regions) for legally relevant concepts (race and religion)? Will legal institutions expect corporate AI development work to use diverse teams or testers? While these AI ethics documents rarely speak of rights or reference legal frameworks, the influence they may have on protections for civil rights in the development and use of AI systems warrant attention to the risks and benefits they pose. For these reasons, the corporate configurations of ethical work-what it means, who does it, and who is responsible for it-deserve scrutiny.",

Through questioning, the AI ethics documents attempt to surface values for reflection and attention, while maintaining responsibility for enacting values with the customer. The question format found in these documents aligns with a plural understanding of values, and the recognition that designers \"make sense of values not at remove... but in the often-confused design situations in which a value has value\" and the role that reflection and questioning play in sorting out \"the value values have in context\" [38] . By prompting clients to engage in such questioning and fact finding, these documents could foster reflective practices among customers and lead to greater ethical competency.",

As Ahmed and Swan note, it's important to \"[track] how diversity gets used within organisations by being attached to specific bodies, units or agencies\" [4] . Here, the documents consistently push diversity work downstream, either by assigning it to customers or by instructing customers on how to assign it to their users or customers. The result is that responsibility never \"attaches\" to the firms, which are continually reiterated as merely providing tools, documentation, and education. Rather than an elision of responsibility, however, these firms frame these responsibility-eliding activities as being responsible. This reconfiguration of responsibility makes the landscape of possible wrongdoing more fragmented, distributed and opaque. In Ahmed's terms, responsibility is \"refused and diffused\" [3] . This diffusion of responsibility-beyond the responsibility for passing responsibility on-is in tension with human rights norms which direct businesses to take responsibility for avoiding and mitigating human rights impacts \"directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts\" [55] .",

On the other hand, these broadened definitions construct a world in which corporations can make progress on AI ethics without addressing diversity and inclusion issues in the workforce and broader society. As technology companies continue to receive criticism on the managerial side for their slow progress in diversity statistics across all employees since 2014 [54] as well as highly reported individual incidents such as Google's 2020-2021 firing of leading AI ethics researchers Dr. Timnit Gebru and Dr. Margaret Mitchell [34] , they have produced and promoted an increasing number of tools and publications aimed at engineering diverse, fair, and inclusive products and services. In this reconfiguration, in the absence of a diverse workforce firms can still push forward diversity and inclusion goals in the form of diverse data sets or personalization tools that can accommodate diverse behaviors and contexts. While these latter goals and work flows may produce better customer experiences, changing data practices may very well be easier than altering hiring practices, corporate culture, and business models, which are all easier than addressing the structural inequalities that civil rights laws seek to address. Methods and tools that bring diversity and inclusion into engineering practice are valuable and necessary for many purposes, but ensuring this drift into engineering logic advances civil rights ideals requires sustained efforts and clear structures that put them in service of them.",

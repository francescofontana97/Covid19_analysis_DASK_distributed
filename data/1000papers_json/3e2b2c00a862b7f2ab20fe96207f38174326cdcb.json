Our study describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes for all intensive care unit (ICU) patients admitted across the Cleveland Clinic enterprise, a 10-hospital health care system in Northeast Ohio, serving more than 2.7 million people. Methods: We analyzed the quality data registry for clinical characteristics and outcomes of all COVID-19-confirmed ICU admissions. Differences in outcomes from other health care systems and published cohorts from other parts of the world were delineated. Results: Across our health care system, 495 COVID-19 patients were admitted from March 15 to June 1, 2020. Mean patient age was 67.3 years, 206 (41.6%) were females, and 289 (58.4%) were males. Mean Acute Physiology Score was 45.3, and mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score was 60.5. In total, 215 patients (43.3%) were intubated for a mean duration of 9.2 days. Mean ICU and hospital length of stay were 7.4 and 13.9 days, respectively, while mean ICU and hospital mortality rates were 18.4% and 23.8%. Conclusions: Our health care system cohort is the fourth largest to be reported. Lower ICU and hospital mortality and length of stay were seen compared to most other published reports. Better preparedness and state-level control of the surge in COVID-19 infections are likely the reasons for these better outcomes. Future research is needed to further delineate differences in mortality and length of stay across health care systems and over time.",

Data were compiled on June 29 to allow a 28-day assessment of outcomes in all patients. Table 1 summarizes demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes data. Before finalizing this report, we gathered available preliminary outcome data as of July 25, 2020 from all 10 hospital ICU cohorts since March. COVID-19 diagnosis was based on a positive polymerase chain reaction of a nasopharyngeal swab. We collected demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory values at admission, ICU admission sources, admission Acute Physiology Score (APS), Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation III (APACHE III) score, hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital and ICU mortality, and duration of mechanical ventilation. The Institutional Review Board at the Cleveland Clinic approved this study (No. 20-418) and waived the need for patient informed consent. A review of other published reports on critically ill patients with COVID-19, available from the United States, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom, and China was performed, with a focus on differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes over time. Chisquare test was used for statistical analysis and comparisons of mortality and mechanical ventilator ratios. ",

Our cohort of 495 patients is the fourth largest to be reported. Median age was 68 years, with a predominantly male population at 58.4% and elevated cohort mean BMI of 31.7 kg/m 2 . These results are similar to all prior reported demographics, supporting older age, male sex, and elevated BMI as risk factors for critical illness and adverse outcomes of COVID-19 infection. Diabetic patients whether type 1 or type 2 representing 35.8% of the ICU COVID-19 population is consistent with findings from Vancouver, Canada [8] ; Seattle, WA [6] ; and Washington state [12] , as well as a multi-center cohort study across 65 centers in the United States [7] . This percentage is significantly higher than the 9.4% reported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Diabetes Center in Northeast Ohio, the 9.7% reported by the State of Ohio, and the 9.1% reported by the United States [15] . This confirms diabetic comorbidity to be associated with adverse outcomes including critical illness and ICU admission in COVID-19 patients.",

Consequently, all reported morality and LOS are likely underestimated. Although unable to compare admission acuity across cohorts and case series as APS and APACHE III scores were rarely reported, several factors can explain our lower mortality and LOS. First, the state of Ohio enacted early social distancing measures, school closures, and a \"stay at home\" order prevented a surge in COVID-19 infection and in ICU and hospital bed utilization. These measures allowed proper time for all health care systems to prepare, and none was overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients as was seen in other states such as New York and other countries such as Italy. In addition, we found a significantly lower rate of mechanical ventilation of 43.4% compared to most other cohorts and a lower median 7.0-day duration of mechanical ventilation compared to the 10 to 13.5 days reported in other studies [6, 7, 8] . Our planning and strict protocol-based best practice daily spontaneous breathing trial and sedation weaning also likely contributed to the result differences. Finally, as mentioned above, the date of data collection in June could have played a role in the observed reduction in ICU mortality since the start of the pandemic [11] . The main limitations of our study are the retrospective nature and use of data from a single health care system, which might restrict generalizability. However, this single system comprised 10 hospitals across Northeast Ohio, serving 2.7 million people. Our analysis of outcome data from more than 495 ICU patients with a 28-day follow-up is the fourth largest to be reported. Lower ICU and hospital LOS and mortality were noted compared to most other published cohorts and case series across the globe. Better preparedness and state-level control of preventive measures seem to be the most plausible explanations for the lower mortality and LOS. Future study should determine if the lower rate of mechanical ventilation use and shorter duration on mechanical ventilation played a role.",

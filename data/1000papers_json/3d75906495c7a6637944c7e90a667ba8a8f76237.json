Patients with ESKD receiving in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD) have had high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. What is not known is how durable the serological responses in ESKD patients are or whether evidence of prior immune responses protect patients from reinfection. In this study of 356 ICHD patients, at 6 months following the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, fewer than 3% of patients lacked evidence of either humoral or cellular immunity. Furthermore, patients with serological evidence of infection had a significantly lower risk of being diagnosed with subsequent infection or 'reinfection', suggesting functional immune protection.",

To date, patients with ESKD, whether on dialysis or transplanted, have been excluded from the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials. Dialysis patients are recognised to have lower rates of seroconversion to vaccinations compared with healthy controls, which in part is due to the impact of uraemic toxins on the immune response (22) . This also translates into higher sepsis related mortality rates in dialysis patients compared with the general population (23) . This immune deficiency appears to be related to responses to new antigenic pathogens, which of vital importance in the outcome to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (24) . As there is no ESKD efficacy data available from any of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to date, we can only hypothesise from previous vaccination programmes that seroconversion in dialysis patients will be inferior than the general public. Extrapolating from the knowledge that the immunosenescence associated with aging is seen prematurely in dialysis patients, and that older people had significantly lower levels of anti-spike protein antibody and neutralising antibody levels at 28 days post the BNT162b2 injection than younger patients; suggests the urgent need for some prospective data in this vulnerable population (5, 25) . Furthermore, baseline serological status of patients from past exposure may be of relevance in ESKD patients, and it will be of interest to evaluate whether vaccine responses are inferior in infection na\u00efve patients (26) .",

Less than 3% of infected patients had no detectable serological or T-cell responses at 6 months. We have also shown that risk of subsequent PCR positive confirmed infection was significantly lower in patients who have had detectable antibodies. Together, these data suggest that immune responses post-infection maybe protective against reinfection. Given the high prevalence of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave in ICHD units, this is important information for the nephrology community whilst vaccination programmes roll out.",

The WHO declared the pandemic on 11 th of March, which gave official clarity to the scope and urgency of the issue.

Model diagnostics were performed to examine normality and influential data points were used to assess model performance. Model diagnostics showed that Italy, Belgium and Germany were influential countries in mortality analysis whereas Luxemburg and Iceland were influential for incidence analysis using Cook's D criteria. Residuals for both multiple regression analyses were approximately normal. Log-transformation of the two outcomes improved the normality but the adjusted R 2 was smaller for the mortality model. Interpretation of original measures of mortality and incidence were used for all models so that the interpretations were clear and meaningful. Finally, we conducted sensitivity analysis using data from the United States, since the total sample size is similar to the combined European countries. These analyses followed the same procedures as above and were done to assess whether the model explored for Europe could be replicated elsewhere. Table 1 shows the summary statistics for all data and by time interval (time interval in days before or after day 50), and the Spearman correlations between variables. The mean mortality, incidence and life expectancy were higher in the time interval 31-50 compared to time interval 51-73 (p<0.001). Mortality and incidence were highly intercorrelated (r = 0.84, p<0.001), and positively associated with life expectancy (r = 0.75, p<0.001). The correlation between mortality with time interval was -0.83 (p<0.001) and -0.73 (p<0.001) for incidence. Outpatients contacts per person per year had a weak association with mortality and incidence. Fig 1 is the scatterplot of mortality and incidence per million vs. days from the 22 nd of January with a locally weighted smoothing line. The figure shows that the slopes for both mortality and incidence before day 50 were steeper than during the time interval between days 51-73. Results from bivariate and multivariable piecewise regression after removing influential data are displayed in Table 2 . The parameter estimates for time interval attenuated slightly in the multivariable analysis, but remained statistically significant.",

We include only a few variables, and two outcomes. We recommend that future analyses include more potential covariates to explore the complex causal web of COVID-19 health outcomes and their relationships with policy decisions and provide estimates of effects of specific factors on outcomes. Finally, while our hypothesis about higher efficacy to control the epidemic where it started later seems logical, more research is needed on specific public health measures taken by European countries. Such research should find ways how to standardise the interventions and how to make use of relevant non-English literature. ",

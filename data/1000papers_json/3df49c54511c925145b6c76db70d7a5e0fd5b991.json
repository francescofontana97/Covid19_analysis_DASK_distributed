Studies imply that limbal stem cells are crucial for maintaining the physiological border between the conjunctiva and the avascular cornea (Notara et al., 2018) , and also provide corneal epithelial homeostasis. In a healthy bulbar conjunctiva, the metabolic demand can be postulated to be lower than the limbal region as the main function is to sustain an intact translucent epithelial surface and supply nutrition to the underlying sclera.",

The DRS equipment used in this study did not allow for sufficient precision of probe positioning to differentiate between limbal and bulbar DRS recordings, and DRS data can accordingly not be compared between limbus and bulbar conjunctiva. The conjunctival SmvO 2 values (OUH: 88 \u00b1 5.9% and CC: 94 \u00b1 7.5%) were higher in the CC than OUH piglets, but this difference may be due to lack of precision in probe positions during recordings. The SmvO 2 values were also considerably higher than what is reported from skin of piglets and humans Fredly et al., 2015; Sundheim et al., 2017) , indicating a high physiological reserve capacity of oxygen delivery. Since the partial pressure of oxygen in air is higher than in the lung alveoli (\u2248160 mm Hg versus 104 mm Hg), it is also possible that oxygen diffuses directly from the air into conjunctival capillary erythrocytes.",

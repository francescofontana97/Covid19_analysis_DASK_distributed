Internal motivation factors included a welcoming atmosphere, challenging activities, and a sense of competition. Each year of orientation the had full-time staff and student workers moderate four activity stations focused on People & Services, Online Resources, Library IT, and Circulation.

Loo, Clinical Librarian, UC San Diego Library, La Jolla, California Background: When conducting a systematic review, the search for evidence can be a challenging process for novice searchers. There are complex procedures with multiple sources of guidelines and the prevailing instruction is targeted at intermediate and higher skill levels. To address these challenges, this project created self-instruction materials framed along an explicit search workflow. This instruction was developed through qualitative content analysis of four major systematic review guidelines. The result is a comprehensive yet straightforward self-instruction guide for advanced literature search skills. This paper reports the development methodology and observations from the guide's use in reference consultations.",

Over 300 recommended search objectives and tasks were extracted, with many duplications across the guidelines. This analysis defined the phases of a comprehensive search workflow and synthesized recommendations into search tasks and stepwise procedures. The workflow has five phases addressing search strategy design, search conduct, results management, document retrieval, and search reporting. Additionally, a directory of 150+ recommended databases was compiled. The resulting instructional guide is assigned as preparatory reading before a reference consultation, serves as a discussion framework during the session, and functions as a reference tool afterwards. The guide was evaluated through librarian peer review and user feedback.",

Efforts were made to fund programming that had the potential to reach audiences frequently underrepresented in biomedical research. In order to be funded, CBOs needed to have existing high quality health programming that can be adapted for public library audiences and be able to complete in-person programs at public libraries in their area between October 2019 and April 2020.

Background: The Data Repository for the University of Minnesota (DRUM) is a publicly available collection of digital research data generated by University of Minnesota researchers, students, and staff. Within DRUM, there are 43 datasets with human subjects data. A human subject is a living individual about whom a researcher obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates information. Datasets published in DRUM are openly available, broadly disseminated, and downloadable without restriction. Because of the sensitive nature of human subjects data, and the potential issues with publishing such data in a publicly accessible repository, we assess all human subjects data before acceptance. Ongoing conversations with researchers and other campus units regarding human subjects data in DRUM have brought to light the need for an analysis of our own processes as well as a scan of other repositories' practices and policies for the purpose of formalizing a human subjects policy for DRUM.",

DRUM's ongoing efforts to educate and establish campus-wide understanding of the issues led to the second aim of this study: we conducted a scan of 105 repositories that ingest human subjects data and analyzed 1) language related to participant consent on the website and 2) language related to participant consent in the deposit agreement.

The library now provides a weekly one-shot class on using EndNote, EndNote consultations, assistance with troubleshooting software issues and with developing complex workflows for special groups. Additionally, the EndNote Special Interest Group maintains an EndNote LibGuide and discusses any EndNote problems, such as issues that result from updates to software or operating systems. Over the last two years the health science librarians have learned how to manage growing demands for EndNote training and dealt with challenges communicating with the Office of Information Technology, the official owner of the site license. This session will share information and report time data about maintaining a citation management software site license for libraries considering a similar program.",

Background: In 2017, the Health Sciences Libraries combined their ILS with the larger university library system's. This integration led to several other transitions and reorganizations, including the 2018-2019 integration of the two standalone medical and dental library websites into a newlydesigned university libraries' site. The website integration challenged the Health Sciences Libraries to not only reorganize content and rethink services, but to conduct internal education about health sciences libraries' roles and users to units that primarily serve undergraduate populations. How could one website speak to the needs of such a diverse range of users -from undergrads to clinical researchers?",

Objectives: California has long used legislation to drive social justice in medicine. Laws passed to further continuing medical education (CME) have served to strengthen CME programs in the medical community. CME is also employed to teach professionals how to understand and communicate with patients from diverse backgrounds. Hospital librarians are valuable assets to CME programs.

Rethlefsen, AHIP, Associate Dean and Fackler Director, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida Background: The future of employee wellness initiatives is bright as more corporate and academic employers recognize that investing in a healthy workforce is money well spent. The University of Florida Libraries recently adopted a new strategic direction aimed at improving the wellness of its employees, users, and communities. To support this direction, a Library Wellness Committee (LWC) was created. While the LWC was in its formative stages, a College of Health and Human Performance (CHHP) faculty member approached a library administrator asking if the library would be willing to serve as a real-world example for her Worksite Health Promotion (WHP) course.",

According to the plan, the WHP students would assess the wellness needs of our employees by two different methods, environmental scan and electronic survey. For the former, ten student teams were assigned a different library site to visit and assess the availability of healthy food options, space for offering wellness programs, etc. For the latter, students are in the process of creating an anonymous survey to be distributed to library employees electronically after approval from the human resources department of the Libraries and the LWC. All of the resulting data will be shared with the LWC to serve as a baseline assessment and inform their future program planning.",

Background: Over the course of a year, this library-based project team asked members of our university community, What Makes a Monster? Through connections with organizations across campus and classroom engagement with students, the team created a campus-wide conversation about monster theory and how American society creates monsters-the other-during times of stress.",

Background: Are regularly-scheduled library classes a valuable service offered by libraries? Librarians were hesitant to offer recurring library classes because attendance was historically low. The scheduling system was cumbersome, and there was no consistent assessment of attendance, class content, or teaching quality. To improve our recurring library classes, the library increased marketing efforts, standardized evaluation, and adopted a scheduling program that tracked registration and attendance. The library now has baseline data to make future evidence-based decisions about scheduled classes and course content. Further, our library administration can use collected data to demonstrate value of this library service to the medical school.",

The librarians and staff joined the marketing team to promote the classes across campuses. Marketing prominently noted classes were simultaneously offered in the library and live-streamed. At the end of each semester, class and survey data were exported and cleaned for analysis. With the new system in place, the number of classes offered doubled. This led to three times the number of attendees in Spring 2019 compared to Fall 2018. The average class size increased by one. Survey response rate was 84%. Class attrition rate was 36%.",

Objective: Share your thoughts and practices in this unconference where open discussion will take place around the various processes that exist and what necessary techniques should be used for assessing the quality of data for curation and for reuse. As more libraries provide services covering more of the research data lifecycle, an increasing number of checklists, toolkits, and resources abound for the process of assessing data quality for curation and for reuse. Therefore, the aim of this immersion session is to bring people of various experiences together to find new or common ground around best practices for assessing data quality and in engaging in data curation. This unconference will allow ideas and practices to be shared where librarians providing these services, working as data researchers, or engaged in related areas, can provide input on how they are incorporating these tools, while the informal nature of the unconference will allow varied levels of participation, from listening and asking questions to sharing practices and presenting briefly.",

We describe how a pop-up library was devised and implemented as a unique form of outreach at a main campus of an academic medical center.",

These competitions, when guided by librarian instruction, support participant's understanding of research data management and health data literacy-related competencies. Participation in biomedical data competitions helps participants identify, consider, and develop solutions to challenges associated with how big biomedical data influences patient well-being. Data competitions are particularly useful for highlighting issues associated with the underuse of uniform data standards and issues associated with navigating siloed data. Long-term data competitions allow participants to submit their work in iterative phases and to receive feedback throughout the hacking process. This approach welcomes beginners and attracts participants who might not participate in traditional data competitions. However, these competitions have high attrition rates.

Background: An academic research institution and a corporate hospital system formed a new graduate medical education (GME) consortium. The consortium objectives were to increase the scholarly activity of the residents and fellows in a national hospital system's GME residency program to match the requirements set forth by the ACGME. A GME librarian position was created specifically to serve the GME research programs at Florida area hospitals to help with this objective. The GME Librarian experience is unique and other GME Librarians will benefit from hearing about the activities and lessons learned from the GME Librarian in this position.",

Creating curricula utilizing both academic and corporate content meant maintaining academic integrity and unifying the culture and vision of both institutions to improve patient outcomes and achieve worthwhile academic and scholarly activity required by ACGME. Developing this dynamic and evolving curriculum requires a continuous improvement process based on feedback from the RFFs, the hospitals, and both institutions.",

Libraries interested in using a critical librarianship framework for their IRs have the opportunity to apply this to their strategic plans. Critical librarianship is the belief that, in our work as librarians, we should examine and fight attempts at social oppression. This concept also applies to IRs.

Importantly, they show concern for research waste generated by poor reviews, thinking critically about not only improvements they can make in their own reviews, but the difference they can make to the KS landscape overall. Following the workshop, many students are excited to share their new skills with their team, while others expand their team to recruit librarian expertise, or pivot the project entirely for more feasible deliverables. We are expanding our programming to include workshops for supervisors and non-medical librarians working with students conducting KS. BACKGROUND: For the past decade, a number of web-based or computer software programs or products have been used to aid the process of collaboration in conducting systematic reviews. The anatomy of these products would be useful for health sciences librarians when making informed decisions on product selection in conducting systematic reviews or in budget planning by administration. Health sciences librarians play a key role in systematic reviews and other types of research syntheses. We, a team of health sciences librarians from four different libraries, have been actively collaborating and leading efforts in conducting systematic reviews at our own home institution.",

Increasingly with the growth of big data, open data, and the electronic health record (EHR), clinical and translational researchers must be more data literate. At our biomedical campus, we noticed an increased need for data literacy training, including assistance with navigating health system components related to data across the research lifecycle.

We worked with leadership in the school of medicine and the clinical and translational science center to co-fund a new librarian position (the \"informaticist\") focused on meeting the needs for data literacy training and health sciences data landscape navigation. We recruited across a variety of professions -information science, public health, informatics, and more -to achieve our goal of filling this informaticist role with a person knowledgeable in the complexities of privacy, compliance, data systems, and the research data lifecycle.",

Another issue is that the pyramid does not incorporate patient (or health system) values, which is an essential element of evidence-based practice. Several other concerns with the pyramid will be detailed. An evidence funnel model will be presented as a supplement or alternative to the evidence pyramid.",

At a university with a large library system, including two health sciences libraries operating within the larger organizational construct of the main campus library, we had come to a place wherein, due to organizational structures and \"habits of comfort,\" groups were not connecting as departments functioned largely as disconnected silos. A reorganization and contiguous personnel changes provided opportunities to bridge the gaps across silos, resulting in better teamwork across units, and also significant impacts to establishing new services to the library's communities.",

Our objective is to determine if the AI function of DistillerSR is comparable to the conventional dual review by human subject matter experts during the title/abstract phase of the SR process.Methods: This analytical comparative pilot study analyzes the AI function of DistillerSR for the title/abstract review of references during SRs. We performed a retrospective review of two SRs using our conventional method of dual review by human subject matter experts. To determine the equivalency of DistillerSR's AI function, we created new projects using the same pool of references as the original projects and created an AI training set using the historical data from the original review. Then, we applied the DistillerSR's AI tool to the remaining references and reviewed and compared the outcomes of the review methods to investigate equivalency. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the AI function and assessed the similarities and differences in the results obtained.Results: To determine sensitivity and specificity, we compared the articles included at the title/abstract screening stage with the final pool of evidence included in the published guidelines, as that is of primary importance to our subject matter experts. The sensitivity of DistillerSR's AI tool was 93% for Project 1, with the AI tool missing 8 samples during title/abstract review that were included Session Format: Panel presentation including Q&A with the audience and breakout working groups facilitated by panelists and/or experts in the field to develop practical steps to work towards transformative publishing models applicable to your institution.Objective: The first half of the session, a panel discussion with stakeholders, provides a multicampus system perspective, a dean's perspective, and a line librarian's perspective on what it takes to do consortia agreements for transformative open access change (agreements that shift away from subscription based licensed content toward open access publishing models). The panel will lay the foundation for librarians at a variety of institutions to share how their individual and collective work can plant the seeds for change in publishing. The session's second half will include breakout discussions of practical steps that MLA members want to or can do at their institutions to help bring change at their institution. The foci of the practical approaches discussion will be around collection building in the health sciences, advocating for OA policies at an institutional level, and creating a culture of scholarly communication issue awareness at your institution.Instructional Methods: Pre-session handout (also available at the meeting): definition of terms related to collections, scholarly communication, and publishing During Session: Panelists will present a brief history of one consortium's model for transformative publishing agreements from multiple perspectives including: 1) a line-librarian assisting patrons, 2) a campus who is balancing collecting and service priorities, 3) a multi-campus perspective of creating sustainable longer-term change in the economy of scholarship. The panelists will be led through a moderated, multi-layered discussion that will shift into an open Q&A time for the audience. Recognizing that not everyone has the same level of interest in advocacy, the second half of the session will be spent in small break out groups led by panelists and experts discussing specific aspects of the transformation, e.g., the consortia perspective and how to develop institutional buy-in for change; communication and meeting patron expectations during seasons of uncertainty and change; setting collection priorities and negotiating. The small group discussion goal is for attendees to create action plans for championing open access that adjusts to their own institutional parameters.",

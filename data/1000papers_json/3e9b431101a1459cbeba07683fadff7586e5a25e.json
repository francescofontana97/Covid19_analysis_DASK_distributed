Air or moisture sensitive reactions were conducted under an argon atmosphere using oven-dried glassware and standard syringe/septa techniques. The reactions were monitored on silica gel TLC plates under UV light (254 nm) followed by visualization with Hanessian's staining solution. Chromatographic purifications were performed using a Teledyne ISCO CombiFlash Rf automated chromatography system. NMR spectra were measured in CDCl3. The data are reported as follows in ppm from an internal standard (TMS, 0.0 ppm): chemical shift (multiplicity, integration, coupling constant in Hz.). The carbon and proton spectra for Oxy133, Oxy186, Oxy210, and Oxy232 are shown in Supplementary Figure S2-5.",

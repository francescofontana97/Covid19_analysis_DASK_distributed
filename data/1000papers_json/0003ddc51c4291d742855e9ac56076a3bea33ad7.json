In Chicago, one of the nation's hotspots, African American make up 42% of the cases and 56% of the deaths from the virus 1 There are several pathways that contribute to racial disparities in COVID-19 cases and death.",

Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the entry receptor utilized by COVID-19 and is thought to negatively regulate the activated renin-angiotensin system by diverting the generation of vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (AngII) towards the inactive Ang 1-9 and vasodilatatory Ang 1-7 peptides. A few studies have found racial differences in ACE2 activity, showing African Americans produce higher levels of AngII and demonstrate lower ACE2 activity 3 . Studies have shown that downregulation of ACE2 expression is involved in lung pathology after SARS-CoV infection and elevations in AngII have been directly related to COVID-19 severity 4 . Hence, dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system may place African Americans at disproportionate risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes.",

Increasing evidence support the effects of racial discrimination on biological function. First, altered immune function, hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) dysfunction, and metabolic changes secondary to stress can contribute to medical co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and asthma, all of which increase COVID-19 risk. Everyday discrimination is a stressor that has been linked to poor health, inflammation, and premature cellular aging 6 . Hence, discrimination experiences may also explain why African Americans are at a disproportionately higher risk for poor medical (e.g., cardiovascular disease, metabolic, hypertension) and psychiatric outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety).",

CTRA refers to a common pattern of transcriptional alterations that is activated by chronic low-grade activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The CTRA profile is characterized by increased expression of genes involved in inflammation, and decreased expression of genes involved in innate antiviral responses and genes encoding specific isotypes of antibodies (IgG in particular). Experiences of racial discrimination have been found to explain more than 50% of the Black-White differences in CTRA, particularly in genes that promote inflammation 9 . Together, these studies provide a potential pathway as to how racism and discrimination alter host innate immunity to promote abnormal inflammatory responses.",

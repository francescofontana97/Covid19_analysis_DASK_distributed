            "text": "T he Wayne County Medical Examiner Office (WCMEO) is a key component of Michigan Medicine's cross-functional, interdisciplinary forensics service. It serves Wayne and Monroe counties, including the City of Detroit, a region of the state profoundly stricken by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Since March 2020, WCMEO has piloted the collection and testing of nasopharyngeal swabs from decedents for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a novel strategy to monitor the tempo of the pandemic. Postmortem testing is guided, in part, by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) screening guidelines and also includes random testing of individuals not known to have COVID-19 before death. Using this disease surveillance method, WCMEO has found that the infection rates in symptomatic or exposed decedents closely matched rates of laboratory-confirmed infection in the catchment area. 1 Autopsy studies have shown that diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is the most common lung finding in individuals who die of severe COVID-19 [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] ; however, the extent to which the histologic findings of COVID-19 are unique is controversial. In a prior study using material acquired at autopsy, we showed that DAD in nonhospitalized decedents with postmortem diagnoses of SARS-CoV-2 was morphologically indistinguishable from hospitalized patients who die from COVID-19. In addition, these changes could not reliably be separated from other causes of DAD on the basis of histology alone. 7 Previous studies in COVID-19 patients illustrate that DAD of any cause, including SARS-CoV-2 infection, comprises a spectrum of histologic changes after acute lung injury. Hyaline membranes are the histologic hallmark of the early acute phase of DAD but tend to be less conspicuous or absent altogether in the organizing and persistent fibrotic phases. Diagnosis of organizing DAD at autopsy is predicated on other gross and histologic evidence of catastrophic acute lung injury, including markedly increased lung weights, expansion and distortion of interstitial structures by organizing fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with occasional hyaline membrane remnants, hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes characterized by variable cytologic alterations including nuclear enlargement and nucleomegaly, alveolar collapse with compensatory expansion of alveolar ducts, squamous metaplasia in bronchiolar epithelium, and multiple fibrin thrombi in small muscular pulmonary arteries, arterioles, and capillaries.",

Investigators complete a postmortem COVID-19 checklist at the scene for all nonhospital deaths (Table 1) , using responses from the person reporting the death, family members, and others who may be present. The checklist used for SARS-CoV-2 testing mirrors CDC recommendations. 8 When checklist testing criteria are met (\"checklist positive\"), SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs are collected at the time of autopsy. Specimens were tested under emergency use authorization using either the RealTime m2000 SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) or Simplexa COVID-19 Direct Kit (DiaSorin, Cypress, CA). Additional \"checklist-negative\" cases are randomly selected for SARS-CoV-2 testing daily. Decedents with significant head trauma, anterior lividity, and signs of decomposition are excluded from random testing, because previous data showed the most swabs collected on those individuals would return invalid results. 1 Complete postmortem examinations are performed by qualified forensic pathologists on all cases flagged as possible COVID-19 by screening checklist. Other indications for full autopsy include homicides, accidents, and natural deaths in decedents younger than 55 years. At the time of autopsy, representative sections of tissue, including the lung, are submitted for tissue processing and hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides are made. Sampling of the lungs is directed by the gross findings to include areas of heterogeneity, always including bilateral sections, with number of blocks ranging from 3 to 9.",

Multiple thrombi/thromboemboli with associated pulmonary infarcts were identified in 1 of our cases that lacked other histopathologic evidence of lung disease. This is in keeping with previous reports of death from thromboembolic disease in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals. 2, 9, 10 We also identified rare fibrin thombi without other morphologic features of DAD in a homicide victim for whom COVID-19 was not suspected. Although we cannot categorically exclude that this finding is trauma-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation, it may be consistent with reports of SARS-CoV-2-mediated endothelial injury occurring independent of DAD. 11 In summary, use of a CDC-based screening checklist will capture most cases of COVID-19-related DAD, but this screening technique is relatively insensitive. Should medical examiners and health officials choose to use postmortem SARS-CoV-2 testing to monitor the tempo of the pandemic, testing should include daily random testing because this might identify cases previously unknown to be COVID-19 deaths. This can only be accomplished through examination of lung histology and incorporation of other data to exclude other causes of DAD.",

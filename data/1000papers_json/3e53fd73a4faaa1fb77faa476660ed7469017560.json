            "text": "COVID-19 exhibits variable symptom severity ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening, yet the relationship between severity and the humoral immune response is poorly understood. We examined antibody responses in 113 COVID-19 patients and found that severe cases resulting in intubation or death exhibited increased inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and high anti-RBD antibody levels. While anti-RBD IgG levels generally correlated with neutralization titer, quantitation of neutralization potency revealed that high potency was a predictor of survival. In addition to neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, patient sera were also able to neutralize the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant D614G, suggesting protection from reinfection by this strain. However, SARS-CoV-2 sera was unable to cross-neutralize a highly-homologous pre-emergent bat coronavirus, WIV1-CoV, that has not yet crossed the species barrier. These results highlight the importance of neutralizing humoral immunity on disease progression and the need to develop broadly protective interventions to prevent future coronavirus pandemics.",

Yet, the need for antibodies in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been challenged by two recent cases of patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia who acquired and survived SARS-CoV-2 infection without requiring oxygen or intensive care (Soresina et al. , 2020) . Some studies even propose the possibility of a pathogenic role of antibodies in primary infection via antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) and augmentation of inflammation (Liu et al. , 2019) , although it is believed that this is insufficient to explain the prevalence of severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Arvin et al. , 2020) . As such, a beneficial, neutral, or harmful role of antibodies in active coronavirus infection remains controversial.",

Hydroxychloroquine was initially tested in patients based on in vitro studies Z. Chen et al. , 2020) , but subsequent meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials have demonstrated no benefit in preventing or treating COVID-19 (Boulware et al. , 2020; Tang et al. , 2020; Ullah et al. , 2020) . Morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 is largely a consequence of adult respir atory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by a combination of both hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states (Domingo et al. , 2020) . Among experimental treatments currently being evaluated, dexamethasone and other corticosteroids that result in immunosuppression have been shown to reduce disease severity (Siemieniuk et al. , 2020) and improve survival (Horby et al. , 2020) .",

While it has been suggested that this mutant results in a more fit virus, the serological consequences of this change are unclear. Additionally, recent studies in bats have described a novel coronavirus (WIV1-CoV) with high homology to SARS-CoV-2 that uses the same ACE2 receptor for cell entry (Menachery et al. , 2016) . It has been postulated that this virus may present a similar pandemic risk if it were to spread from bats to humans.

Our COVID-19 patient cohort contained a wide range of outcomes, including non-hospitalized, hospitalized, intubated, and deceased individuals. We assessed inflammatory markers, IL-6 levels, lymphocyte counts, and demographic variables such as age and sex. A quantitative ELISA that measures IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and a high-throughput neutralization assay using lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 and WIV1-CoV were developed to assess neutralization potency and cross-neutralizing responses.

We also assessed 1,257 pre-pandemic serum samples composed of a large unbiased cohort ( n = 1,124) and selected cohorts of individuals ( n = 133) with positive serology results for cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, syphilis, Toxoplasma, and/or rheumatoid factor ( Figure 2B ). Anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA levels were measured for each sample by interpolation on to the standard curve and a receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was used to determined optimal cut-offs that distinguished SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from pre-pandemic controls ( Figure 2C ). Cut-offs of 1.18 U/mL for anti-RBD IgG achieved 73% sensitivity, 2.14 U/mL for anti-RBD IgM achieved 66% sensitivity, and 0.95 U/mL for anti-RBD IgA achieved 48% sensitivity, with >99.0% specificity for all three.",

Interestingly, no cross-reactivity was seen to SARS-CoV RBD despite 73% homology, nor to MERS-CoV, which has only 17% homology ( Figure S2C and S2D ). Additional experiments measuring IgG antibodies against the RBD of two common cold coronaviruses-NL63, which has 20% homology to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and HKU1, which has 1.9% homology ( Figure S2C )-showed a seroprevalence of >95% ( Figure S2E ), as has been shown in previously published studies (Gorse et al. , 2010) , with no correlation between the IgG antibody levels of NL3 or HKU1 with SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure S2E ). These data show that anti-RBD IgG antibodies induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection do not cross-react to recognize the RBD of other pandemic coronaviruses. In addition, anti-RBD IgG antibodies to common cold coronaviruses appear to not provide detectable pre-existing reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD nor do they correlate with anti-RBD IgG levels in COVID-19 patients. Overall, these data suggest that natural infection with coronavirus results in anti-RBD antibodies with limited cross-reactivity.",

However, pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike produced by these methods yield low titers (Nie et al. , 2020) , hampering large-scale testing of neutralization. Recently, a forward genetics approach identified an efficiently replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) variant encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike containing a truncated form lacking the C-terminal 21 amino acids (Case et al. , 2020) . Interestingly, previous studies also showed a role of the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV in altering surface expression and fusogenic potential (Corver et al. , 2009) . To determine whether analogous truncations might improve SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production, we examined the cell-surface expression of truncated forms of SARS-CoV-2 spike and found that removal of 18 amino acids from the C-terminus (\u039418) resulted in significantly greater cell-surface expression and higher titers of pseudovirus ( Figure S2F -H ). This truncation removed a putative ER-retention signal (Lontok, Corse and Machamer, 2004; McBride, Li and Machamer, 2007; Ujike et al. , 2016) while retaining cysteine-rich domains that are highly conserved among coronaviruses. Using these spike modifications, we developed a CoV pseudovirus neutralization assay compatible with high-throughput liquid handling instrumentation in 384-well plate format using our previously published lentiviral vector system expressing both luminescent and fluorescent marker transgenes ( Figure 2D ) (Crawford et al. , 2020) .",

The dilution titer that achieved 50% neutralization (NT50) was calculated for each specimen and ROC analysis was performed, revealing that an NT50 threshold of 1:20 achieves a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of >99.0% in identifying COVID-19 patients ( Figure 2G -H ).",

These individuals also had the highest neutralization titers ( Figure 3H ). In contrast, individuals that were not hospitalized had the lowest anti-RBD IgG and IgA levels and neutralization titers. Unsurprisingly, immunosuppressed individuals-none of whom passed away-had significantly blunted IgG, IgA, and neutralizing responses. Upon analyzing anti-RBD antibody seropositivity and neutralization titer, we found IgG seropositivity was an excellent predictor of neutralization with a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 100% ( Figure 3I ). When seropositivity for any anti-RBD antibody was present, neutralization could be predicted with a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 94%. Anti-RBD IgG levels correlated the most with neutralization ( R 2 = 0.76) ( Figure 3J Although anti-RBD IgG levels correlated with neutralization by regression analysis, there was variability that appeared to segregate by our pre-defined severity cohorts ( Figure 3J ). To better visualize this, we plotted residuals of each neutralization titer subtracted from its predicted titer based on the regression ( Figure 3K ). This revealed that samples from severely ill patients were biased towards lower-than-predicted neutralization titers, suggesting that they harbored higher levels of non-neutralizing anti-RBD IgG antibodies that did not contribute to neutralization. Consequently, we calculated a neutralization potency index (NT50/IgG) for each patient, and found that intubated or subsequently deceased patients had a significantly lower index ( Figure 3L ), with all deceased patients having an index <100. Accordingly, when patients were classified as having neutralization potency indices that were 'high' (\u2265100) or 'low' (<100), there was a significant risk of death in the days following sample collection in the 'low' index group (87% 30-day survival, n = 68) and there were no deaths in the 'high' index group (100% 30-day survival, n = 30) (p = 0.03; Figure 3M ). Of note, this finding was true across our entire cohort of 111 COVID-19 patients (including non-hospitalized and immunosuppressed individuals) for which both anti-RBD IgG. In addition, neutralization potency index did not correlate with days after symptom onset and remained predictive of survival when using a Cox proportional hazards model that accounted for age, sex, hospitalization status, intubation status, .

These results suggest that this C-terminal truncation can serve as a general approach for modifying coronavirus spike proteins for efficient pseudovirus production. Interestingly, WIV1-CoV spike could be detected at the cell surface by the SARS-CoV and -CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibody CR3022 ( Figure S5B ), a finding that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously described. Using WIV1-CoV pseudovirus, we found that sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals showed a lack of cross-neutralization except for relatively low-level neutralization in a few individuals with very high SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers ( Figure 5F -G ).

Remarkably, neutralization potency was significantly diminished in severely ill patients, and survival analysis demonstrated that an index of \u2265100 was predictive of 100% 30-day survival, whereas <100 was associated with 87% 30-day survival in our limited cohort of 113 COVID-19 patients.

            "text": "Despite the clear correlation between COVID-19 severity and development of humoral immunity, the cause-effect relationship between these two is unclear. One possibility is that severe disease caused by hyperinflammation and/or uncontrolled viral replication induces overproduction of antibodies that serve as a 'biomarker' of severity. This is supported by our finding that the most severely affected patients had the highest levels of inflammatory markers and cytokines, which can drive antibody production. In support of this possibility, a recent study suggests a pathogenic role of immune activation and exuberant antibody production from extrafollicular B cells in critically ill patients (Woodruff et al. , 2020) . Indeed, of all the COVID-19 treatment regimens being used and tested, dampening of the immune response with corticosteroids has proven to have one of the greatest benefits in improving outcomes and survival (Siemieniuk et al. , 2020) , and we find that corticosteroids decrease both anti-RBD IgG levels and neutralization titers. However, another possibility is that high levels of antibodies with low neutralization potency worsen disease severity, possibly via ADE. This is supported by our finding of decreased neutralization potency in severely ill patients, and raises concerns over the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment strategy. One exception, however, may be in immunosuppressed individuals, which generally have sub-optimal antibody levels and neutralization titers. Further studies in animal models of COVID-19 testing passive transfer of low-potency index sera may help resolve this controversy.",

Given our results, it will be important to assess the potency index of each candidate to determine those with maximal potential. Interestingly, one study showed that vaccination of mice with RBD generated potently neutralizing antibodies without antibody-dependent enhancement.

Regardless, our results support a role for anti-RBD IgM and IgA in contributing to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, despite their transient nature in serum. Anti-RBD IgG responses and neutralization, on the other hand, were sustained in the time frame analyzed (~60 days), but several studies have emerged that question the longevity of these responses, which have yet to be determined.

Laboratory data throughout admission were analyzed, and the maximum documented serum levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, troponin-T, and IL-6 were recorded for each patient, as well as the lowest absolute lymphocyte count documented (lymphocyte count nadir).

Triple positivity for anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA was enriched in severely ill patients and was associated with the highest neutralization titers ( Figure S3D-E ). However, anti-RBD IgM and IgA alone were capable of neutralization in serum samples that were negative for anti-RBD IgG ( Figure S3D ). Altogether, these results highlight anti-RBD IgG as the main contributor to neutralization from patient sera, with a contributory role from anti-RBD IgM and IgA.",

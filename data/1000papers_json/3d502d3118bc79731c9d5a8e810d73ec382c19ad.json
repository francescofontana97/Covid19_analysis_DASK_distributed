Counter-intuitively, it cannot be said in general that stronger seasonality leads to a smaller peak (cf. bottom left image of Figure 10 ).

In the \u00cele-de-France region, [16] estimated that the peak number of ICU beds needed would exceed more than 40 times the regional capacity if no strategy is implemented after lockdown, and only efficient case-finding and isolation applied parallel with social distancing could decrease ICU demand below the maximum capacity throughout the epidemic. For Australia, [15] studied three capacity expansion scenarios (2, 3 and 5 times expansion, respectively), and even in mitigated scenarios, demand is estimated to be higher than the number of available beds. Additional social distancing measures were shown to reduce the epidemic to a level where a reasonable expansion of ICU capacity can be sufficient.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 40, "end": 44, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 187, "end": 191, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 424, "end": 428, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 758, "end": 762, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(which was not certified by peer review)"}, {"text": "The peak ICU demand crucially depends on two factors: the probabilities of developing sever disease, and the shape (in particular the peak size) of the epidemic curve.

Disease severity, for simplicity, is expressed by the IFR. In fact, here we used a scaling factor for the probability of hospitalization, with the baseline corresponding to the parameters in Table B .3. In our weak control scenario (Section 2.4.2), the infection fatality rate is 0.4%, which is a bit lower than the finding of [46] . However, during the first wave in Hungary the schools were closed and COVID-19 disproportionately affected the vulnerable population. In our scenarios we assume a widespread community spreading, hence younger generations appear in higher numbers, thus the infection fatality rate is expected to be smaller. In any case, by the scaling of the hospitalization rate (while leaving the probability of intensive care and fatal outcome given hospitalization intact), we explored a wider range of IFRs. We found that indeed the peak ICU demand can vary across a large interval.

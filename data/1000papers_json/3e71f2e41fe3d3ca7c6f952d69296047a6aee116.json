            "text": "The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention officially announced a novel coronavirus as the causative pathogen of COVID-19 on 8th of January 8, 2020 [1] . COVID-19 epidemics started from Wuhan city last December, and on the 30th of January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a public Health Emergency [2] . This disease was named as COVID-19 by the WHO, and the causative virus was named as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [3] . This problem started as a single animal-to-human transmission in Wuhan [1] , and was followed by continued humanto-human spread [4] . Sustained local transmission of the disease all over the world led the WHO to declare COVID-19 as a pandemic [5] . The Incubation Period (IP) of COVID-19 is about 1-14 days [6] , and the period from the onset of symptoms to death was estimated to range from 6 to 41 days [7] . Interpersonal transmission of COVID-19 occurs through respiratory droplets and contact transmission [8] . As the SARS-CoV-2 was found in stool of patients from China and the United States, there is a risk of fecal-oral transmission [9] . The sources of infection are patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and asymptomatic patients and patients in IP who are carriers of SARS-CoV-2 [4] . According to a study done in Wuhan city, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgias, and dyspnea. Of the confirmed cases, 81% suffered mild to moderate disease, 14% suffered severe disease, and only 5% suffered critical illness, with an overall case fatality rate ranging from 2.3% to 5%. Recovery in mild cases occurred after 1 week, while in severe cases, death may be the fate [10] . Those who were at a higher risk for severe illness and death were patients with age >60 years and those having pre-existing diseases as hypertension, diabetes, etc., [4] .",

Approval of local ethical committee was obtained. The tools of this work involved a questionnaire consisting of two parts: (i) Demographics data included age, gender, education, occupation, residence and income. We did not take marital status into account as the study was distributed to include children younger than 18 years old. (ii) Knowledge, attitude and practice toward COVID-19. The knowledge part had 15 questions: six for clinical presentations, mode of transmission and at-risk people (K1-K6), eight for management of COVID-19 (K7-K14), and one for sources of information. These questions were answered on a Yes/No basis with an additional \"I don't know\" option. There are four inverse questions (Is there a vaccine for COVID-19? Seasonal influenza vaccine can be used against COVID-19?, Is there a treatment for COVID-19? and Is COVID-19 patients can be treated at home?). The points were distributed as (Yes = 2, No = 1 and I don't know = 0) except for the inverse questions whereas (Yes = 1, No = 2 and I don't know = 0). The total knowledge score ranged from 0 to 30, with a higher score denoting a better knowledge of COVID-19. The attitude part had seven questions (R = 0-14) and practice part included nine questions (R = 0-18), with at least 80% correct answers were considered as having satisfactory knowledge. Participants with at least 80% positive answers were considered as having a positive attitude and good practice. To avoid inter and intra-observer bias, the data collecting team (three physicians and five civilian individuals) received training on the questionnaire for 3 h followed by testing to assess the preparedness and the quality of the asking and reporting.",

Reliability of the questionnaire was tested and Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the knowledge questionnaire was 0.73 [17] . To the best of our knowledge, no published research reported the level of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) about COVID-19 among Egyptians, so it is estimated that level of KAP equal to level of no KAP (p = q = 0.5) and with acceptable limit of precision (D) of 0.015 value, the sample size was estimated to be 3518 participants.",

So it was not accepted to depend on the online questionnaire alone as it will address not only the educated individuals but also those who know how to deal with online questionnaire so direct administered questionnaire was inevitable. Egyptian aged 12-82 years, understood the content of the questionnaire, and agreed to participate in the study were eligible persons to share in the study via clicking the link or filling in the printed questionnaire.

And made the Chinese study results generalized to high socioeconomic status Chinese sector especially women [35] . Limitation in this study was focused on the inability to direct in-depth health education to online participants about practice while we were able to distribute printed practice posters about hand hygiene to the other participants. The questionnaire also needed to contain more data about type of work (working hours, extent of dealing with public, availability of instructions about hand hygiene in work) and for students (if they take vacation or receive health education through their universities or schools).",

For three-quarters of over 1,100 available monitoring stations, the average nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) concentrations decreased by at least 2.7 \u03bcg\u00c1m \u22123 (or 25%) compared with the average concentrations recorded during the same period of the previous seven years. This reduction was not specific to urban or rural areas because the relative reduction was of similar magnitude in both areas. The ozone (O 3 ) response differed spatially, with positive anomalies in Northern Europe and negative anomalies in Southwestern Europe. Reduced cloudiness and related enhanced radiation in Northern Europe played a significant role in the increase of surface O 3 concentrations by shifting the photochemical partitioning between NO 2 and O 3 toward more O 3 . The level of total oxidant (O x = O 3 + NO 2 ) remained unchanged, except in Southwestern Europe where it decreased. Several episodes lasting a few days of a high level of total oxidants were observed in Northern Europe. The results illustrate the complexity of the atmospheric response to the unprecedented reduction in the emission of primary pollutants.",

Consequently, anthropogenic emissions, especially those related to traffic, were substantially reduced first in China (Le et al., 2020; Shi and Brasseur, 2020) and later elsewhere. The concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) observed at monitoring stations decreased by up to 60%, whereas a simultaneous increase in ozone (O 3 ) concentration by a factor 1.5-2 was reported . Moreover, unexpected increases of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) were monitored during the lockdown period in some regions of China (e.g. the region of Hangzhou), probably due to higher coal consumption for heating .",

Moreover, based on a modelling study, Menut et al. (2020) demonstrated that the O 3 perturbation during the lockdown period was different in urban areas throughout Western Europe due to nonlinear chemical effects. This is further highlighted by Sicard et al. (2020) who showed a variable O 3 increase in four Southern European cities (Nice in France, Rome and Turin in Italy, and Valencia in Spain), ranging from 2.4% in Valencia to 27% in Turin compared with the period 2017-2019. The purpose of the present study is to understand the causes of the surface O 3 concentration change in response to the exceptional short-term reduction of anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Europe. Anomalies are characterized in the concentrations of five regulated pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 and particulate matter (PM 10 ) in rural and urban environments (compared with the previous seven years) associated with anomalies of different meteorological variables. This allows the investigation of the possible causes of the observed O 3 concentration changes, which could be related to the changes in primary pollutant emissions, but also to concomitant changes in meteorology and photochemistry. The study will further focus on the evolution of the total oxidant concentrations (also called odd oxygen), that is, O x \u2248 O 3 + NO 2 (Wang and Jacob, 1998) .",

A reduced major axis regression is used in order to find the slope and intercept of the line that best summarizes the scatter plot of the O 3 anomalies against the NO 2 anomalies (Ayers, 2001) . The slope obtained restricted to negative total cloud cover anomalies (\u22121.75) is lower than the slope obtained restricted to positive anomalies (\u22121.49). This result means that, for the same decrease in NO 2 concentration, the increase in O 3 concentration is stronger where the cloud cover was reduced (thus, solar radiation was increased). Moreover, the intercept is lower for positive anomalies (\u221216.52) than for negative cloud cover anomalies (\u22125.04), which suggests that the concentration of O 3 was higher where the cloud cover was reduced.

The ozone (O 3 ) concentration response is contrasted between Northern and Southwestern Europe with positive and negative anomalies, respectively.

Enhanced cloud cover in Southwestern Europe coincided with the negative O 3 anomalies associated with an important decrease of the level of total oxidant. Radiation and clouds played a major role in O 3 's response to emission reductions. Air mass dynamics may have played a lesser role in the increase in O 3 (by advection or subsidence). Episodes of high total oxidant level were observed in Northern Europe, but an assessment of the role of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) is necessary to quantitatively analyse changes in the chemical regime. Despite the lack of concordance of the anomalies of particulate matter (PM 10 ) and O x , it cannot be excluded that aerosols have played an important role in O 3 's response through the oxidation VOCs, through the production of inorganic aerosols, or through heterogeneous reactions affecting, for example, peroxy radicals (HO 2 , RO 2 ), formaldehyde (HCHO), nitrogen oxides (NO) or O 3 .

(2020) and Ord o\u00f1ez et al. (2020) . Ord o\u00f1ez et al. attributed this increase primarily to the influence of meteorological parameters rather than to the reduction in the emissions of primary pollutants. The present study concludes that the observed increase in O 3 was due primarily to a change in the photochemical partitioning between NO 2 and O 3 due to an anomalously low cloud cover, while the level of total oxidant remained unchanged, except in the Iberian Peninsula and southwestern France, where it decreased.",

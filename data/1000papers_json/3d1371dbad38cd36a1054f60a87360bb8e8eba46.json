The disease caused by the virus is officially called coronavirus disease 19 . The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 and March 2020, respectively. As COVID-19 is raging around the globe having affected over 20 million people across more than 200 countries and causing more than 700 000 deaths, 1 deciphering the unique infection mode of this novel virus and its pathophysiology is a crucial step towards arresting the pandemic.",

            "text": "The current pandemic is distinctive in that the range of innate immune responses is unpredictable and varies; it is strong enough to kill in some, but others escape with a relatively mild infection. Infections with other subfamilies of the coronavirus are generally associated with upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs) although some patients may present with lower RTIs too. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 infection may remain asymptomatic in the early stages until the emergence of severe pneumonia, dyspnea, organ dysfunction and even death. 2 Pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 show pathological changes, degeneration, infiltration and hyperplasia consistent with inflammatory response throughout the course of the disease. 2 In certain cases, the disease triggers a hyper-inflammatory condition 3 that is potentially life-threatening and is often responsible for COVID-19 fatality. 4 The immune pathogenesis associated with an aberrant immune response results in lung damage, functional impairment, reduced pulmonary capacity and eventually death. 2 Such ' cytokine storm' syndromes are described by inappropriately elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by a dysregulated immune response with subsequent multi-organ failure. Interestingly, the COVID-19-associated cytokine storm is distinctive in being associated with early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and coagulopathy, and biochemical parameters include elevated but lower serum ferritin and lower interleukin-6 levels as compared to those encountered in other cytokine storm syndromes. 5, 6 Given the novelty of the disease, definitive insights into the dynamics of the dysfunctional inflammatory reaction in the context of cellular immune responses in COVID-19 are much awaited and anticipated. Understanding the biological and clinical consequences of the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of the disease is important for the scientific community as they are racing against time to develop therapeutics to treat patients. There has been some sporadic evidence to suggest that the level of immune response hyperactivity is significantly higher in patients with severe disease, as compared to patients with a mild infection. [7] [8] [9] However, it is crucial to generate systematic evidence from research that is adequately powered, to statistically compare the cytokine levels in patients at various stages of the illness. In this context, we sought to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of available evidence to understand the pattern of host immune response in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and how the levels of inflammatory and immunological markers vary according to the severity or stage of the disease.",

A few systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been conducted in the last few months, to understand the relationship between cytokines and the novel coronavirus disease 2019. However, they have been majorly centred on exploring the correlation between varying levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the degree of severity of the illness. [10] [11] [12] A few others have provided a broader overview, albeit utilizing data from a very small number of studies for each outcome. 13, 14 Moreover, individual studies with inadequate sample sizes have produced conflicting findings possibly due to a lack of statistical power. As we grapple with a pandemic and continue to get inundated with clinical data from numerous disease cohorts, it becomes imperative to collate existing data and provide the latest scientific evidence, which could be instrumental in informing healthcare professionals and devising appropriate treatment strategies. Therefore, our review was aimed to summarize the relationship between circulating cytokine levels and COVID-19, and more specifically focusing on important inflammatory and immunological markers that are shown to be responsible for an exaggerated immune response that triggers respiratory distress, multi-organ failure and, in the worst cases, death. We undertook a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of the currently available literature, to obtain a detailed and holistic view of the dynamics between the host immune response and levels of disease severity among clinically confirmed patients of COVID-19.",

Articles that did not provide numeric estimates were excluded from this meta-analysis. The confidence intervals of each study of each outcome were visually observed for the presence of heterogeneity, indicated by an overlap. The magnitude of variation beyond chance was also objectively assessed using the Cochran's Q test, 22 to ascertain the level of overlap among the CIs of different studies.

Major factors contributing to the sub-optimal study quality were a lack of consecutive and complete inclusion of participants or unclear reporting of the same, inadequate description of the socio-demographic characteristics of patients and paucity of information about the study sites/hospitals. A high risk of bias emanated from the recruitment and selection process as well as ambiguity in reporting the same, across various studies. Since a majority of the studies included in this review were case series, the overall quality of evidence was not satisfactory. Out of the five retrospective cohorts, three studies had a moderate level of bias, one had a high risk of bias, and one study had a low risk of bias. The major risk of bias in these resulted from the non-representativeness of the study cohorts and gaps in reporting of study outcomes, in terms of timing, assessment and follow-up duration.

The delayed type I interferon (IFN) response in coronavirus infections is known to be associated with more severe forms of the disease resulting in rapid viral multiplication and paradoxical hyperinflammation induced by type I interferons. 67, 68 Further activation of the type I IFN signalling pathways leads to a significant influx of neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes-macrophages, dendritic cells and NK cells into the lungs. These infiltrating cells are the major source of inflammatory cytokines that set off the second wave-the dreaded cytokine storm. 69 A characteristic feature of severe COVID-19 is lymphopenia that has been ascribed to multiple plausible mechanisms including direct viral cytopathic effects, inhibitory effects of cytokines including TNFalpha, IL-6 and IL-10, and immune cell redistribution into the lungs and lymphoid organs. [70] [71] [72] Diminished T-cell responses are known to further retard viral clearance, thus leading to a cytokine-driven vicious cycle. The hyperinflammatory state eventually leads to significant damage to the lung microvasculature and alveolar epithelium causing vascular leakage and alveolar oedema resulting in life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These cytokines and chemokines have also been linked to extrapulmonary complications of COVID-19 including multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome. 73 these proposed mechanisms, we found significantly higher circulating levels of pro-inflammatory markers IL-6, IL-2R and TNF-alpha among patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 as compared to the non-severe cases. IL-8, also known as CXCL8, is a key regulator of neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis in the lungs and is considered to be a prognostic marker for the clinical course of ARDS. 75, 76 In patients with acute lung injury, elevated plasma IL-8 levels have been associated with an increased risk of mortality, as well as reduced ventilator-free and organ failure-free days. 77 In contrast to SARS, we found elevated levels of IL-10, a T helper type 2 (Th2) cellsecreted cytokine and an inhibitor of inflammatory response, in severe COVID-19 patients as compared to non-severe cases.",

            "text": "Higher levels of IL-10 have also been associated with increased expression of T-cell exhaustion markers, PD-1 and Tim-3, in COVID-19 patients and their consequently impaired ability to clear viral infections especially in severely affected individuals. 78 The difference in levels of TNF-alpha though significant was not pronounced, which could be a consequence of lesser number of studies reporting the outcome as well as the rather small sample sizes of a majority of the included studies. We found a significant reduction in lymphocyte counts-both CD4+ and CD8+ in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19. Similar findings have also been reported for SARS as well as MERS and have been linked to disease severity and adverse outcomes in these patients. [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] In follow-up studies in patients with SARS, it was shown that while CD8+ T lymphocytes return to normal levels in 2-3 months, memory CD4+ T cells can take up to a year for full recovery. 84 Our findings can have important clinical implications for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes of COVID-19 management. Currently, there is no consensus on the utility of serial immune monitoring in patients with COVID-19. Based on our findings, cytokine-IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-2R and TNF-alphalevels can serve as potential prognostic biomarkers for risk stratification of COVID-19 patients. An important question that is yet to be answered is whether the therapeutic blockade of IL-6 is considered only in patients with elevated IL-6 levels since variability has been noted in individual studies comparing severe and non-severe cases. For this, the cut-off values for initiation of therapy will need to be defined based on well-designed and adequately powered prospective studies. Screening of COVID-19 patients for hyperinflammatory state using laboratory trends and severity grading systems such as HScore, devised originally for secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), can be useful in identifying ideal candidates for immunosuppressive therapies. 85 Currently, there is significant interest in evaluating the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against IL-6, in COVID-19 patients as evidenced by more than 50 ongoing clinical studies across the globe. 86 The drug is currently approved for rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis and cytokine release syndrome as well as used off-label for COVID-19 as an investigational agent. However, the timing of the IL-6 blocking therapy in COVID-19 patients appears to be crucial since preclinical studies have demonstrated that IL-6 is required for viral clearance as well as control of lung inflammation. 87 On the contrary, high levels of IL-6 may also promote viral persistence through suppression of T-cell cytolytic activity. 88, 89 This dilemma needs to be resolved through clinical trials aimed to determine whether early IL-6R blockade hampers viral clearance. Based on the available evidence, management of early stages of COVID-19 should focus on antiviral approaches and/or augmentation of IFN type I response. Remdesivir, an antiviral prodrug, has recently shown some benefit in patients with moderate COVID-19, indicating that targeting early stages of the illness and patients with moderate disease is perhaps a more rational approach. 90 Subsequently, in more advanced stages, use of immunomodulation strategies to control the infection-associated hyperinflammation could be critical in reducing COVID-19-linked mortality. The latter is also supported by the findings from SARS patients, where ARDS occurs despite declining viral loads, suggesting the role of hyperinflammation rather than pathogen virulence in determining adverse patient outcomes. 91 The recent findings from the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 thER-apY) trial, where low-dose dexamethasone reduced mortality by one-third in mechanically ventilated and one-fifth in oxygen-requiring patients, are in consonance with this approach. The trial enrolled more than 6000 patients, and evidently, no mortality benefit was observed in individuals not requiring respiratory support at randomization. 92 However, our review findings need to be interpreted with caution, owing to the high heterogeneity among studies reporting inflammatory markers. Several factors could be responsible for this variation in effect estimates in some of the outcomes, like variability in sample sizes and non-uniform distribution of patients in the severe and non-severe groups. Heterogeneity might also be a consequence of weak study designs and other methodological shortcomings, studies employing varied cut-offs to categorize patients into disease severity groups and differences in the underlying comorbid conditions, as well as variability in the timing of measurement of the biomarkers. However, the fact that the statistical test for assessment of heterogeneity is largely underpowered in a meta-analysis 22 wherein studies are either very few in number or have small sample sizes should also be taken into consideration.",

Moreover, all the studies included in the meta-analysis are from China. Our literature search was conducted during the initial months of the pandemic, wherein most of the available data was from Chinese patients. This could limit the generalizability of our findings to some extent. Since levels of inflammatory markers can vary over the course of the infection, the timing of laboratory assessments can also impact the findings. However, the median time from symptom onset to hospitalization was reported by nearly one-third of the studies and it ranged from 7-11 days. Lastly, we could not include non-English articles due to unavailability of appropriate translators.",

            "text": "Our findings showed that severe COVID-19 was characterized by elevated circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lower levels of T lymphocytes, when compared to patients with mild-to-moderate disease. However, welldesigned and adequately powered prospective studies are warranted to further strengthen the current evidence base. Prospective studies that follow a structured approach towards intensive immune monitoring along with daily clinical evaluations can further elucidate the mechanisms underlying COVID-19 immunopathology. Such data will be crucial in resolving the clinical dilemmas related to the timing and type of anti-COVID-19 therapy. Given the urgency of generating scientific data to help understand the disease and its shortterm and long-term implications, it is understandable that efforts are underway to make research publicly available as soon as possible. But studies that are methodologically sound and involve thorough reporting of essential aspects are lacking. We believe the several ongoing studies evaluating the role of immunomodulation in severe COVID-19 patients can hopefully provide further clarity, and these therapies may prove instrumental in tackling hyperinflammation to improve patient management and clinical outcomes.",

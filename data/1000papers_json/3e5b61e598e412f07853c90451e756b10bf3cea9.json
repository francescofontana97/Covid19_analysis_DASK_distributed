The change in physical function met our definition of noninferiority looking at the primary outcome of the physical function domain. No statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes were observed between patients on the two different intervention arms. These results are consistent with those previously reported for de-escalating zoledronate and add to the literature about the acceptability of de-escalating denosumab and pamidronate. This data, in addition to systematic reviews in both breast [7] and prostate cancer [8] , indicate no statistically significant evidence against the suggestion that de-escalation of BTA is a reasonable treatment option. These finding are especially important at the moment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, when both patients and physicians are trying to safely reduce the number of visits patients make to healthcare providers. The observed difference in SSE rates between the two study arms is notable. Previous studies have shown similar rates of SREs and SSEs between 4-weekly versus 12-weekly dosing of pamidronate [2, 4] , zoledronate [3, 5, 18] and denosumab [6] . Prior evidence from systematic reviews of de-escalation in both breast [7] and prostate [8] populations showed no significant difference in SSE rates. To date the largest data set is from three trials evaluating the de-escalation of zoledronate in patients with breast cancer [3, 5, 18] and showed no significant difference in SSE rates. This is reflected in recommendations from evidence-based guideline groups [19] . In the current trial, the 1-year cumulative incidence rate of SSE was 7.6% (95% CI: 4.3 to 10.9) and 16.6% (95% CI: 12.0 to 21.2), whereas the 1-year SSE-free survival was 79.1% (95% CI: 71.0 to 85.2) and 72.4% (95% CI: 63.5 to 79.5) in the 4-weekly and 12-weekly arms, respectively. Despite these observed differences, none of these were statistically significant. Although the study was not powered to show a difference in SSEs and these results are not incompatible with chance results. Given the additional evidence from other trials indicating no difference in SSE rates, it is believed that the observed numerical differences in SSE rates between 4-week and 12-week BTA is due to chance; however, further evidence is required to confirm this hypothesis.",

Although there is considerable heterogeneity in the study subgroups (2 different tumour types, 3 different drugs, 2 different settings with patients pre-treated with BTA and BTA-naive), the study was designed to be broadly applicable to real-world practice by including patients with breast and CRPC. These differences in baseline characteristics could have led to differences in the results. For example, patients who have been on BTAs might be assumed to have a different risk profile for SSEs compared with BTA-naive subjects. The pragmatic nature of the trial with very few restrictive inclusion criteria also means that the study population more readily reflects that in clinical practice. The pragmatic nature did however mean that factors like burden of bone metastases (e.g. <3 bone metastases vs 3e10 metastases vs > 10 or similar) was not available for the analysis as this level of data is not routinely collected at the study sites. This reality of real-world practice is noticeable in the number of patients who died during the study period (n Z 54), as well as the number of patients who changed from 12-weekly to 4weekly dosing (8.5%) and from 4-weekly to 12-weekly (13.5%) dosing (refer Consort Fig. 1 ). Although the sample size calculation included a 10% adjustment for patient attrition (for a total sample size of 250 patients) and 263 patients were accrued, it is clear that in reality in the setting of a real-world trial in patients with metastatic cancer that this value should have been higher. Use of HRQoL was also important as ultimately with any palliative intervention, we need to ensure quality of life of our patients.",

The sample size was based on HRQoL analysis as the primary end point. Use of SSE as the primary end point would have significantly increased the sample size, the duration and the cost of the trial to such an extent to make it unlikely to ever occur in our current research funding environment. As BTAs are supportive care interventions, HRQoL is also important and validated patent reported outcome. A challenge with all studies is the choice of HRQoL score to use, especially as some are long for patients to complete and missing data due to patient 'questionnaire fatigue' becomes very challenging. Although several bone metastasisespecific tools exist, we felt as the QLC-30 has been validated in patients receiving BTAs [15, 21] (as well as radiotherapy) [22] and its relative ease of completion, that this tool would enable us to achieve the goals of the study. Another limitation could be viewed as the inclusion of hypercalcaemia of malignancy as an SSE in the present study. However, as hypercalcaemia can lead to hospitalisations and incurs costs to both the patient and the healthcare system, we felt it was important to include it as an end point. Given the lack of any clinically meaningful difference in the primary analysis, even with greater sample size, it is highly unlikely to affect the study results substantially. Finally, the study follow-up was only for 1 year; however the protocol has been updated to allow patients to remain on study for 2 years, which will be analysed at a later date.",

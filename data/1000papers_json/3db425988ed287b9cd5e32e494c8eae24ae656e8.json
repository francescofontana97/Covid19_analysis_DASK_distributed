There are several logistical challenges to consider for instructors administering exams remotely. It is difficult to ensure that students complete exams independently in remote settings. There are software programs that can be used to proctor exams remotely, using strategies such as locking an individual's computer for a set amount of time or recording the student's movements through a webcam. Apart from ethical concerns about surveillance, students have reported that these forms of remote exam proctoring are extremely stressful and make it more difficult to focus. calculations, interpretation, and critique. Indeed, after students graduate, rarely will they be asked to practice epidemiology without access to reference materials. One possible exam question might provide students with an abstract from a recently published article and ask them to identify the study design and summarize the key results. In advanced epidemiology courses, an exam could require a student to design a study to answer a specific research question or reproduce specific calculations from the results of a published article. These approaches could work well in both core and substantive epidemiology courses. Regardless of the format, it is imperative that expectations be clearly articulated. Instructors must specify what students may or may not use as aids during the exam. Can they use their class textbook or notes or search the internet? Are they allowed to discuss answers with classmates? Can they post on Twitter seeking answers from #epitwitter?",

It is almost inevitable that some students will fall ill with COVID-19, have family members or friends who fall seriously ill, have child-care related crises, or experience mental health challenges related to or exacerbated by the pandemic. These burdens will not fall equally among our students. (14, (24) (25) (26) (27) Students who belong to racial/ethnic minority groups, from low socioeconomic backgrounds, international students, and those with childcare or caregiving responsibilities are likely to be disproportionately affected by the pandemic. We must be sensitive to these concerns. When possible, look out for signs that your students are struggling, such as missed class sessions, lack of communication, late or missed assignments, or declining class performance. We recognize that an instructor's ability to monitor their students' well-being may be limited in remote settings. However, Access to statistical software may be a particular concern for epidemiology courses focused on data analysis as students may have lost access to on campus computer labs or software. Some universities offer remote access through virtual computing sites as an option, although these sites are often slow and require a continuous Internet connection for use. One option for instructors would be to consider using open source software packages, such as R. Despite these challenges, online teaching has the potential to be beneficial for instructors using statistical software in their courses, such as the ability to share screens and write code collaboratively. Consider a class focused on data analysis. During a synchronous class, the instructor may prompt students to calculate the median of a simple data set using PROC Means in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). If students are having trouble getting their code to run properly, they can share their screen with the class to troubleshoot the problem, or the instructor can share their screen to show a walkthrough of the process. Real-time feedback using screen sharing from instructors or peers could help to alleviate some of the stress and frustration students feel when learning data analysis or a new coding language.",

            "text": "current topics in epidemiology and public health. For instance, the evidence base related to the current pandemic is developing rapidly; each week new research is published furthering our understanding of COVID-19.(6) What we knew in the early days of the pandemic about SARS-CoV-2 transmission and risk populations is different than what we know now.(7,8) Even adding a week of lead-time to class preparation may make lectures feel outdated.Didactic content in the pandemic eraCore concepts covered in most epidemiology programs include measures of disease occurrence, including calculating effect estimates, types of study design, and analytic strategies.(9, 10) However, the COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about potential gaps in epidemiology training programs.Certain topics have come to the forefront over the past several months and it is worth considering whether these should be included in the basic training of all epidemiology students. A sample of these topics include 1) infectious disease epidemiology and surveillance, 2) the role of social determinants of health and health disparities, and 3) public health ethics. Here, we present additional discussion on two specific topics that have been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic.The importance of descriptive epidemiologyEarly in the pandemic, United States surveillance often did not incorporate routine collection of race and ethnicity data alongside infection data. This neglect delayed the identification of important racial and ethnic inequities in COVID-19 incidence, hospitalization, and mortality and in the United States.(11)(12)(13)(14)(15) The pandemic has highlighted the importance of rigorous descriptive epidemiology, especially in times of public health crisis. High-quality data on measures of morbidity and mortality by person, place, and time are essential precursors for analytic epidemiology and causal inference. Descriptive epidemiology is often overlooked in favor of causal effect estimation, yet the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of including a rigorous treatment of descriptive epidemiology and surveillance, and their role in an effective and equitable public health response, in training programs.Knowledge translation and health communicationAs the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, epidemiologic research is rapidly and iteratively informing healthcare and public health policy, including clinical guidelines for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), antibody treatments, and convalescent plasma as potential COVID-19 treatments, vaccine development trials, and local and statewide policies for mask-wearing and social distancing.(16)(17)(18) The importance of accurate dissemination of information (and uncertainty) from epidemiologists to policy makers and the news media cannot be understated. Knowledge translation is a skill that should be taught as part of epidemiologic curricula. For example, it is important for epidemiologists to be able to explain how bias can influence the results of studies purporting to identify key risk factors for disease.(19) A case-study in poor public health communication could be made of the messaging on masks, where initial lack of evidence for masks as protective against COVID-19 was interpreted as evidence of absence of a protective effect, and subsequent recommendations for masking were interpreted as a lack of scientific consensus on the topic. Further, the pursuit of public health research topics that have become entangled with a political agenda, such as HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 or mask-wearing policies, could be discussed in coursework in relation to research ethics(20,21) and best practices for scientific communication with the media and policymakers.

Most platforms have features that facilitate online instruction, such as blogs, wikis, collaborative notetaking, student peer-review, and grade management systems. Additionally, several popular video recording applications -Zoom, Panopto (Panopto Inc, Seattle, Washington), Kaltura (Kaltura Inc, New York, New York), and Echo360 (Echo36 Inc) -have built-in voice recognition software and enable instructors to add closed captions to the lectures.

            "text": "recent years, flipped classrooms have received considerable attention as a teaching strategy. The flipped classroom is a student-centered instructional method that moves didactic content outside of the classroom in an asynchronous format and uses in-class time for active, problem-based learning.Education researchers have demonstrated that this approach can improve the quality and efficacy of teaching, and can result in improved academic performance, student engagement, critical thinking, and less confusion among students.(29) Baytiyeh (2016) demonstrated that using a flipped classroom model enhances students' feelings of autonomy, problem solving skills, teamwork, communication, enjoyment, and creativity.(29) Flipped classrooms seem particularly well suited for epidemiology courses. There are many core topics in epidemiology that are conceptually difficult but become much clearer when students have the chance to work through the steps of the calculations. For example, consider direct and indirect age standardization. In traditional classroom-based approaches, the instructor would introduce these topics and demonstrate the steps involved with the calculations. Students would observe and take notes to reinforce or augment the instructor's lessons. In a flipped classroom model, the instructor would create an asynchronous online lecture on the topic, with similar content to a traditional lecture. Students would watch this lecture and then attend an in-person class session (or, in the case of remote-learning, a synchronous online session) that has them use simple tabular data from the population of interest and a reference population to calculate the age-standardized mortality rate. In this approach, students get hands-on experience and have the opportunity to see that simple algebraic equations underlie many key concepts in epidemiology. In advanced courses, the same model could be used, but with students using in-person or synchronous online time for programming using statistical software. Instructors interested in implementing this model should consider that it requires students to devote substantially more outof-class time. All time spent watching lectures asynchronously and then doing course-related exercises in person or synchronously should count toward required credit-hours to avoid overburdening students.Beyond pedagogic advantages, the flipped classroom model introduces and reinforces the notion of teamwork and collaborative science as important skills for epidemiologists. Time spent working through exercises and calculations allows students to learn from each other, build rapport, and establish social From an instructor's perspective, lectures or modules recorded for asynchronous instruction during the pandemic could be repurposed and utilized in a flipped classroom model after the pandemic.",

Synchronous teaching allows students and teachers to interact as the material is taught. Many synchronous teaching platforms also allow instructors to record lectures for students who are not able to attend class sessions.Instructors can pose questions to students during their lectures and pause for students to form answers(2), and students can ask questions or request clarification. Some software platforms include interactive features that facilitate synchronous teaching, such as virtual 'hand-raising', emoji reactions, polls, and chat boxes. Some platforms, such as Zoom, allow the students to be divided into breakout rooms for activities or discussions and instructors can 'drop-in' to different rooms to observe or answer questions. Small-group breakout sessions allow students to build rapport and establish social connections. Breakout rooms can also facilitate group work via screen sharing, which may be useful for collaborative epidemiology exercises such as generating 2x2 tables and estimating crude measures of association or drawing directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).While synchronous teaching has advantages, it also raises important concerns about equity and inclusion. For students to successfully participate in real-time online class sessions, they must have access to a computer with high speed internet available at the scheduled class time, ideally in a distraction-free and quiet environment. Many students live in shared housing, which may interrupt negative predictive value. Students could also be asked to pause videos for 'thought experiments'.

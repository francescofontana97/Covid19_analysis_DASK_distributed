No antecedents of any systemic disease were recorded in the anamnesis and analytical data, other than those specifically related to the SARS-CoV-2, were within the normal limits. No signs of coagulopathy were detected. The echo-doppler study of the testis at that time showed mild hypoperfusion. Testicular pain was then thought to be secondary to orchitis and symptomatic therapy with empiric antibiotic coverage was started. Pain, however, did not recover and 3 days after a second echo-doppler showed a complete testicular infarction ( Figure 1A ). Left orchiectomy was then performed ( Figure 1B) . No signs or symptoms of vasculopathy were detected elsewhere. The patient was treated with corticoids and was asymptomatic at last contact. Right testis is not affected.",

Direct endothelial damage induced by the virus alters the in situ glycocalyx thus favoring hypercoagulability [2] . Diffuse alveolar damage, interstitial, and organizing pneumonia have been observed in the lungs of several autopsy studies [3] . However, almost every organ can be affected. Some other similar examples of ischemic changes secondary to virus-related vasculopathy, i.e., ischemic vascular stroke [4] , intestinal ischemia [5] , and gallbladder ischemic necrosis [6] , some of them occurring in young people, have been occasionally reported. Orchitis and impaired spermatogenesis have been previously associated with COVID-19 infection [7, 8] . However, massive testicular ischemic infarction in the context of COVID-19 infection has not been reported so far.",

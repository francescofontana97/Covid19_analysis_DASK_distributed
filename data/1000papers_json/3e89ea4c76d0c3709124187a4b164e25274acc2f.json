The probability of being infected (p e ) has to 1 be assessed by the voter to make his decision. In particular, it depends on the disease prevalence around the voter. The disease-related cost depends on two elements: virus characteristics and voters characteristics. According to the hazardousness of the virus, infected people bear an opportunity cost (C e ), mainly a loss of income. For instance, a cold has not the same consequence as Ebola. But the cost also depends on the person characteristics. For instance, a cold has not the same consequence for a healthy person as for a frail person. Moreover, if people take into account the impact of their health situation on their relative, we add another cost into the calculus. This is also an expected cost because it is related to the probability of being infected by voting. And we assume the voter bears a cost deriving directly from the health deterioration of their relatives due to his voting decision. So, the disease-related cost becomes p e (C e + \u03b1C r ) where \u03b1 is an indicator of altruism and C r the cost for relatives.",

The mechanism behind the relationship is that poor health is related to a weaker social network that leads to less social participation, in particular political and electoral participation. With more sophistication as the relationship seems to be conditioned to several respondent's characteristics, this link is also observed for oldest people (13) and youngest people (14) .

They find that the lock-down increased support for the status quo decision-makers, institutions and regimes. But they don't find any effect of the lock-down on ideology or political interest. Closely related, and sharply in contrast, to our analysis is their question about turnout. They report that turnout would increase from 81% to 83% after the lock-down. It remains to be seen if people maintain their response as social and economic costs of the pandemic rise, particularly in a context where governments adopt very different approaches to combat the pandemic. Now, we turn to aggregated data that seem more suitable to analyze impacts of epidemic disease, and so, more in line with our purpose. Indeed, it is unlikely that a survey includes enough people being infected by the disease to allow testing its impact on electoral participation. A unique study scrutinizes such relationship at aggregated level and has been written by (27) . He examines at regional level the link between turnout rate and local influenza prevalence in Finland and the United States from 1995 to 2015. And he concludes that influenza outbreaks are associated with lower electoral participation in both countries. In his study, the author is not able to distinguish between the three effects of epidemic disease on participation detailed before. Moreover, as he measures the influenza prevalence at the election moment, his measure is mainly about an ex post measurement.",

First, following the Downsian Closeness Hypothesis (e.g., (29) ), we include into our specification, the size of electorate with the log natural transformation of registered voters in the city. Second, we take into account the number of lists running at the election as measure of electoral competition (30) .

With a unique list running at the election, the election is not competitive and the expected turnout is low.

First, considering the sense of civic duty and satisfaction of voting per se, we assume that all the sociodemographics variables approximate the factors of these elements, especially education level and size of the city (inhabitants). Expressive dimension of voting is also captured by the number of list running at the election.

The interaction between distance to clusters and post is not significant, meaning that the distance to clusters does not affect turnout differently in 2020 compared to 2014. This insignificance, however, disappears once we split the sample into two subsamples of 'young' and 'old' municipalities. A municipality is considered to be 'young' if the share of population over 65 is less than the national average, 20%, and is considered to be 'old' when that share is more than 20%. 13 The second column of Table S4 shows that the interaction effect between distance and post is negative. In contrast, column 3-7 shows that the interaction is positive and statistically significant. Thus the municipalities with higher proportions of older voters participate more (less) when they are far from (close to) COVID-19 clusters than those populated with relatively younger voters. The interaction effect becomes more significant when we include control variables, including department and municipality fixed effects. To substantively interpret the interaction effects, Figure  S3 shows the turnout rate for any given level of distance to COVID-19 clusters. Turnout drops by about 20% in a municipality located closest to COVID-19 clusters, but that drop decreases to less than 18% at a municipality located on the other extreme, at the farthest distance from the disease clusters. That is, the effect of distance when moving from one extreme to another is about 2 percentage point. In contrast, for younger municipalities the decline is reinforced to about 23%.

Regarding controlling for important variables, columns 4-7 of Table S4 shows that the effect of distance becomes even more significant after including the set of control variables. Regarding the relationship between distance and participation, if we do not find any difference between the 2008 and 2014 elections, then it is reasonable to assume that the common trends assumption is plausible. Figure S4 shows that while both the levels and slopes are fairly similar between 2008 and 2014. The drastic difference in both level of turnout and slopes of distances is observed only in 2020. In 2008 and 2104 elections the slop for old is statistically significantly smaller than the slop for young. In 2020 elections, however, that difference in slopes is statistically insignificant ( Figure S5 ).",

Electoral participation decreases particularly in older towns. In contrast, in younger municipalities, it is either insignificant (column 3), or it is positive (column 7). The change in median income increases the change in turnout. Interestingly, the effect of change in electoral competition is large and significant with theoretically expected signs. Relative to a situation without any change, an increase by one or two more competing lists increases turnout by a large magnitude. Conversely, when competition decreases turnout sharply declines. The results pertaining on competitiveness of elections indicate that even during a pandemic voting calculus explains whether people vote or abstain. The results in Table S6 , reflects those reported in Table S5 . The only difference is how we measure COVID-19.

In Table S7 we include and then exclude a set of municipality-specific variables: size of the municipalities measured based on population (columns 1, 4-6), status of municipalities capturing whether a municipality is rural, city-center, suburb, or a remote city (columns 2,4), and municipality categories (columns 3-4). In column 5 we include the log of registered voters, and column 6 include department fixed effects. Our key variables of interests are not altered by including or excluding those control variables. Log of population density decreases turnout by a magnitude ranging from 4 to 8 percentage points. Lack of competition, measured by liste unique, decreases turnout by a much larger magnitude of about 19 percentage points. Interestingly, and contrary to what one would expect, percentage of population over 75 increases turnout, a peculiar aspect of French municipal elections. As expected, home ownership, which measures the benefits of participation increases turnout. Municipalities with higher share of homeowners participate more. Political variables such as voting for Macron (M acron V ote) in the last presidential elections, and whether the incumbent mayor is a candidate, increases turnout. The economic variables such as M edian Income, and U nemployment, are also significant, with income coefficient being negative while unemployment affecting turnout positively expect when we include department fixed effects. Given that this pandemic began in China, and as such is associated with globalization we include number of hotel rooms per capita, in log scale, a variable that we expect to captures presence of interest in globalization. The results reported in Table S7 shows that Number of hotel rooms per capita increases turnout. Obviously, in addition to turnout a key question to address is how voters voted. Did they vote for pro-globalization or anti-globalization candidates. We will analyze this important question after the second round of the elections, as it would be difficult to draw conclusions based on the first round of elections given that candidates behave strategically in the first round. A second and more important reason why we postpone this question is that at this stage the ideological positions of the candidates are not publicly available. A municipality is considered to be 'Old' ('Young') if the share population over 65 is more (less) than the national average, 20%.",

We first show that our results do not depend on how operationalize old and young municipalities. In Table S10 we interact post with pop65 and divide our samples within a given distance from COVID-19 clusters. Column 1 of Table S10 limits the sample to municipalities within 50 km of COVID-19 clusters, and Columns 2, 3, and 4 restrict it to those falling within 50-100 km, 100-200 km, and beyond 200 km, respectively. Columns 5-8 repeat this exercise but include a set of control variables. The results reported in that Table indicate that the coefficient of interaction between post and pop65 is negative when we consider the municipalities that are close to COVID-19 clusters. That coefficient is insignificant for intermediate municipalities that are within 50-100 km, but beyond that limit the coefficient of the interaction term becomes positive and highly significant. Overall the Table indicates that the closer a municipality is to COVID-19 cluster, relative to 2014, the lower is turnout rate for old municipalities. Conversely, the older municipalities that are far away from the COVID-19 clusters the turnout is higher than in 2014. The results become even more significant when we include control variables. Next, we show that our results also hold when we use alternative measures of COVID-19. In Table S8 , in addition to distance, we include the following measures: Virus Dummy a dummy indicating whether any cases of COVID-19 was observed at the time of elections, Hospital Visits a measure of number of hospital visits, Hospitals Visits for corona virus measuring the number of hospital visits due to corona virus, Hospitalization for corona virus, and Corona Cases which counts the number of COVID-19 cases in a given municipality at the time of election. Table S8 shows that, with the exception of hospital visits, all other variables measring COVID-19 are significant with the expected sign, positive for the distance, and negative for the presence of cases or hospital visits due to corona virus.",

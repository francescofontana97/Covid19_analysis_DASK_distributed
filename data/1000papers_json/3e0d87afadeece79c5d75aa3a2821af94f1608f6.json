There 14 are opportunities to further the science of wastewater-based epidemiology by monitoring 15 viral RNA in wastewater to assess disease prevalence and spread in defined populations, 16 which may prove beneficial for informing COVID-19 related public health policy.",

On 11 February 2020, 27 the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced severe acute respiratory 28 syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the name of the new virus [3] . Unlike all previous 29 pandemics in modern history, COVID-19 is truly a global crisis. Never before have we seen 30 the health care systems of some of the world's most industrialised nations on the verge of 31 collapse [4] . Unprecedented measures (social distancing, school and workplace closure, and 32 restricted intra-and international movement) have been enforced by governments around the 33 world to stop the spread of COVID-19. As the world adapts to unprecedented behavioural 34 and societal changes in response to the threat posed by societal operations, 35 including many essential municipal services must also adapt and change. These essential 36 services such as waste collection and wastewater treatment are routine and indispensable.",

These RT-PCR assays can also be modified 69 and adapted to detect and quantify the virus in environmental samples such as wastewater[5].70    The transmission behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 also has important implications for waste and 71 wastewater services. SARS-CoV-2 specifically targets host cells containing ACE2 proteins.72 ACE2 is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, 73 arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines. After infecting and exhausting all resources in the host 74 cell to multiply, the viruses leave the cell in a process known as shedding. Data from clinical 75 and virological studies provide evidence that shedding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is most 76 significant early in the course of the disease, immediately before and within a few days since 77 onset of symptoms [2]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has namely been detected in blood, sputum, 78 respiratory secretions, and faeces from symptomatic patients [2, 14-16]. The contribution of 79 viral shedding from asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers to SARS-CoV-2 transmission 80 remains in question. While it is likely that viral loads in asymptomatic carriers are relatively 81 low, further research is needed [17]. 82 A preliminary report from the WHO indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via droplets 83 and contaminated objects during close unprotected contact between an infector and infectee 84 [2]. Data to date suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, with early reports from 85 China indicating that the virus spread rapidly and sustainably throughout some affected 86 communities [18]. Alarming infection incidents among health care workers, cruise-ship and 87 airplane passengers also point to the likelihood of additional transmission mechanisms in 88 confined spaces with dense populations. Several alternative transmission routes are possible 89 but their validity in this context is yet to be determined [19, 20]. Possibilities include 90 transmission via inanimate/environmental surfaces (fomites), aerosols and the faecal-oral 91 route [17, 21]. All three are likely to be important in specific circumstances [17], highlighting 92 the need to identify critical control points and implement specific measures to mitigate 93 possible COVID-19 transmission during waste and wastewater collection.",

Data from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses 97 suggest that they remain viable in the environment on a range of surfaces for several hours98 5 and several days (Figure 1). The survival time of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and plastic is 99 in the order of days, which suggests that waste materials originating from households and 100 quarantine facilities with positive or suspected COVID-19 patients may contain viable 101 SARS-CoV-2 and could be a source of infection. In the initial stages of this outbreak, waste 102 collection procedures had not been revised to address the potential threat of COVID-19 in the 103 broader community. Effectively, waste from infectee households and quarantine facilities 104 would meet the definition of clinical waste. For instance, the Australian Standard AS 105 3816:2018 defines clinical waste as \"any waste that has the potential to cause injury, 106 infection, or offence, arising but not limited to medical, dental, podiatry, health care services 107 and so forth\".

In 113 many countries, patients with mild symptoms have been directed to self-quarantine at home.114Similarly, hotels and student accommodation are being used by some authorities to 115 quarantine return travellers, including those positive for COVID-19, for at least 14 days. This 116 unprecedented situation presents new and significant challenges for the provision of waste 117 collection services to these locations and a new challenge to the parties responsible for 118 collecting and handling such waste.

A delay in waste collection time of 72 hours (which is the 133 likely life span of COVID-19 in the environment) is also recommended by ACR+. In 134 addition, the collected materials are transported directly to waste incinerators or landfills 135 without any segregation. At the time of this article, it is unclear how many cities or regions 136 within ACR+ have implemented this recommended practice. Implementation of the revised 137 waste collection protocol in Figure 2 is not simple and requires a high level of coordination 138 with the relevant authorities, especially health departments regarding data sharing and 139 privacy protection. Due to privacy concerns, there is very limited or no sharing of patient (or 140 suspected patient) data between health authorities and the waste services sector in most 141 countries around the world. Indeed, the authors are not aware of any suitable data sharing 142 mechanisms currently available or in place that can facilitate coordination between health 143 authorities and other sectors whilst preserving privacy.

            "text": "Implications for wastewater services 150 During the SARS outbreak in 2003, wastewater aerosols were identified as a 'highly 151 probable' transmission route affecting residents at the Amoy Gardens complex in Hong 152 Kong. The outbreak at that location involved over 300 cases and 42 deaths [27]. Follow up 153 investigations confirmed that high concentrations of viral aerosols in building sewer 154 plumbing were drawn into apartment bathrooms through malfunctioning floor drains when 155 bathroom exhaust fans were running [28]. Virus-laden aerosols originating in the bathroom 156 were subsequently extracted via over-sized bathroom exhaust fans into the building's light 157 well and then spread under prevailing winds to adjacent units up to some 200 m away [29]. 158 Immediately after the investigation, the management committee of the Amoy Gardens 159 complex repaired all defects in the building's plumbing system [28]. 160 The residual uncertainty around the definitive cause of the Amoy Gardens SARS cluster and 161 the likely role of faulty or improperly functioning plumbing highlight the need to review 162 similar housing complexes where individual apartment units are connected via plumbing air 163 vents so as to prevent disease transmission by aerosols. Subsequent research revealed several 164 in-building fixtures in which pathogen laden aerosols can be generated from wastewater such 165 as vacuum and flushometer toilets [30]. Thus, certain steps or locations along the wastewater 166 handling and treatment train, especially in the upstream collection network may be suitable 167 for implementing monitoring or control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",

            "text": "the Environment analysed wastewater samples from the Amsterdam Schiphol 173 Airport over several weeks and found that, using RT-PCR, they could detect SARS-CoV-2 174 within four days of cases being confirmed in the country[2]. Importantly, detection of SARS-175    CoV-2 RNA in wastewater does not imply that the virus is viable and able to infect humans.176Coronavirus in wastewater is relatively short-lived, with 3-log 10 reduction in virus titre 177 reportedly occurring within 2-3 days[32]. However, given the genetic similarity of SARS-178 CoV-2 to the earlier, widely-studied SARS-CoV [33] and the known faecal-oral transmission 179 potential of that virus [15, 34-36], it is possible that a similar transmission pathway exists for 180 SARS-CoV-2. For example, positive SARS-CoV-2 infection of gastrointestinal glandular 181 epithelial cells has been reported, suggesting that infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions are 182 secreted from virus-infected gastrointestinal cells, establishing the potential for faecal-oral 183 transmission [19]. The same study also indicated that infectious SARS-CoV-2 had been 184 isolated from faecal samples; although at the time of writing, these data remained 185 unpublished [19]. This contrasts with other research that failed to isolate infectious virus from 186 faecal samples (13 samples taken from four patients) [20] so clearly more work is needed to 187 explore the potential for faecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 188 With careful selection of sampling points along a sewer network, wastewater 'snapshots' can 189 be used to obtain information pertaining to select populations of varying size, e.g. from a 190 particular quarantine facility, hospital, or local government area, or up to hundreds of 191 thousands of people from a larger catchment area. In the case of SAR-CoV-2 the monitoring 192 technique is based on analytical genomic approaches similar to those used clinically to 193 diagnose suspected COVID-19 patients. This may also be augmented with additional 194 analytical steps to provide a quantitative measure of the targeted viral RNA concentration [5]. 195 With further development and using well-designed sampling campaigns with suitable spatio-196 temporal resolution, wastewater monitoring could well become a useful tool to monitor and 197 assess the incidence of COVID-19 disease within populations to inform related public health 198 policy. 199 True quantitative assessment of community SARS-CoV-2 infection would be extremely 200 challenging due to the large number of factors involved and the unknown variability in these 201 factors (e.g. large variability in SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding rates between people and also 202 within people at different stages of infection, unknown persistence of viral RNA in 203 wastewater, variable flow conditions in sewer systems) [6, 37]. These difficulties, however, 204 do not preclude the usefulness of wastewater monitoring as a semi-quantitative early 205 detection system for SARS-CoV-2 re-emergence (or at worst presence/absence) and 206 potentially also as an ongoing tool for informing jurisdictional policy responses to COVID-19 207 management. For example, routine wastewater testing could be used to inform when to relax 208 restrictions on population movement or re-open commerce. Having such information 209 9available in real-time to inform policy setting would have substantial economic value given 210 the daily cost of COVID-19-related lockdowns. For example, the daily cost of strict 211 economy-wide lockdown in the United States has been estimated at some US$11.5 billion 212",

Although current waste and 223 wastewater management practices such as hospital waste separation and incineration, multi-224 barrier wastewater treatment and disinfection, and PPE protocols have already been designed 225 to mitigate infectious disease exposure risks for workers and the public, the COVID-19 226 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented and rapid change.

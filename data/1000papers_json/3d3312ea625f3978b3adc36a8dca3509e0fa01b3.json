            "text": "Here, we present for the first time, a site-specific N-glycosylation analysis of proteins from a Brazilian Zika virus (ZIKV) strain. The virus was propagated with high yield in an embryo-derived stem cell line (EB66, Valneva SE), and concentrated by g-force step-gradient centrifugation. Subsequently, the sample was proteolytically digested with different enzymes, measured via a LC-MS/MS-based workflow, and analyzed in a semi-automated way using the in-house developed glyXtool MS software. The viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) was glycosylated exclusively with high-mannose structures on both potential N-glycosylation sites. In case of the viral envelope (E) protein, no specific N-glycans could be identified with this method. Nevertheless, N-glycosylation could be proved by enzymatic de-N-glycosylation with PNGase F, resulting in a strong MS-signal of the former glycopeptide with deamidated asparagine at the potential N-glycosylation site N444. This confirmed that this site of the ZIKV E protein is highly N-glycosylated but with very high micro-heterogeneity. Our study clearly demonstrates the progress made towards site-specific N-glycosylation analysis of viral proteins, i.e. for Brazilian ZIKV. It allows to better characterize viral isolates, and to monitor glycosylation of major antigens. The method established can be applied for detailed studies regarding the impact of protein glycosylation on antigenicity and human pathogenicity of many viruses including influenza virus, HIV and corona virus.",

The E protein is a surface glycoprotein and is considered as one of the major antigens among flaviviruses for vaccine development. It facilitates viral entry into host cells and is the major target for neutralizing antibodies due to its high expression level in the cell's envelope 9 . One potential N-glycosylation site of the E protein is described, which may however mutate, leading to a loss of the consensus sequence 9 . Its glycosylation plays a major role for infectivity, viral assembly and secretion of the ZIKV 10 . Recently, glycosylation of the ZIKV E protein was demonstrated to correlate with host-virus interaction and pathogenesis 11, 12 . The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has two potential N-glycosylation sites. It is crucial for the evasion of the host immune system via inhibiting type 1 interferon production by impeding tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) complex formation 13, 14 .

Recently, we demonstrated such an analysis for influenza A virus, elucidating the site-specific glycosylation of the major antigen hemagglutinin (Gr\u00e4nicher et al. 26 ). For the glycoproteins of ZIKV, such an analysis is still missing. While the glycosylation of viral antigens is still not a critical quality attribute in vaccine manufacturing (except for recombinantly produced vaccines, e.g. Flublock), we believe such fundamental analysis of complex biologicals can become crucial in the future as glycosylation may mask antigenic sites, stimulate the host immune response and affect vaccine efficacy 27 . As shown for the three-dimensional structure of the homodimer NS1, the glycoprotein has two potential N-glycosylation sites-N924 and N1001 (Fig. 2) . Site-specific N-glycosylation analysis revealed NS1 to be exclusively N-glycosylated with high-mannose-type N-glycans on both potential N-glycosylation sites, which is in accordance with the literature for other flaviviruses, like dengue virus 28, 29 . For dengue virus, the intracellular NS1 dimer is described to occur host cell independent high-mannose-type N-glycosylated. Whereby the extracellular NS1 hexamer is described to have complex-type N-glycosylation 28 . We assume the results are obtained from intracellular NS1 dimers resulting from cell lysis during long term cultivation or vesicles including NS1 dimers 30 and might also reflect the glycosylation of the wild ZIKV independent from the host cell line. All annotated MS/MS fragment ion spectra are depicted in the Supplement. At site N924, we could only identify one N-glycan referring to Man5. The site N1001 was found to be glycosylated with Man6-Man9 N-glycan compositions.",

Exposure indicates good accessibility for receptors and antibodies. However, N-glycoproteomic analysis did not yield any N-glycopeptides of the E protein. Furthermore, although the proteomic analysis did properly cover the sequence of the E protein, we were not able to identify a precursor ion or fragment ion spectrum for the non-glycosylated peptide sequence in the vicinity of N444 of the E protein (see Supplement, Figure 1A ). The lab scaled virus purification using g-force step-gradient centrifugation was optimized to the size of the ZIKV. However, traditional proteomics 20 of the purified virus pellet using mammalian database and ZIKV FASTA resulted in the identification of many host cell proteins co-eluting (see Supplement, Table 1 ). Therefore, glycoproteomic analysis seems to be the method of choice to identify virus protein glycosylation, because glycomic approaches bear the risk of detecting N-glycans from the host cell system, even after gel separation (data not shown).",

            "text": "However, to figure out if the E protein is N-glycosylated, we performed the de-N-glycosylation via PNGase F treatment of our sample, a procedure which is widely accepted to identify N-glycoproteins in complex samples [32] [33] [34] [35] , as only N-glycosylated asparagine (Asn/N) converts to deamidated Asn (= aspartic acid (Asp/D)) with a mass shift of 1 Da. Thus, with this enzymatic de-N-glycosylation, all glycoforms of an N-glycopeptide converge into one signal of the respective de-N-glycosylated peptide with deamidated asparagine, which significantly increases the chance of detection by LC-MS/MS. Doing so (enzymatic N-glycan release of the tryptically digested ZIKV proteome by PNGaseF), the various glycoforms of the E protein glycopeptides with N444 resembled into an amino acid sequence with a deamidated N444, i.e. D444. Supplement (Figure 1 ) shows the sequence coverage of the ZIKV E protein before (A) and after PNGase F treatment (B). After PNGase F treatment, the peptide Fig. 4 . Accordingly, our findings prove that the ZIKV E protein investigated in this study was indeed highly N-glycosylated, but with too many different N-glycan compositions, resulting in too many low abundant precursor signals to be detected by LC-MS/MS. Overall, our study clearly demonstrates the progress made towards site-specific N-glycosylation analysis of ZIKV proteins. In addition, it might be used for other heavily glycosylated viral proteins, for example the spike S protein of Corona viruses 36 , i.e. SARS-CoV-2 37 . This motivates, especially for viruses with pandemic potential, to investigate the glycosylation of viral proteins more closely, and to associate biological (e.g. virus isolate, virus entry, pathogenicity, antigenicity) and vaccine-related factors (e.g. host cell/expression system, virus seed generation, critical quality attributes) to the glycosylation of the major antigens.",

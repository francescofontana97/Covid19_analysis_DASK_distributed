Tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibodies are indicative but unreliable measures of exposure. Here instead, for four highly-affected countries, we determine population susceptibilities by directly comparing country-wide observed epidemic dynamics data with that of their main metropolitan regions. We find significant susceptibility reductions in the metropolitan regions as a result of earlier seeding, with a relatively longer phase of exponential growth before the introduction of public health interventions. During the post-growth phase, the lower susceptibility of these regions contributed to the decline in cases, independent of intervention effects. Forward projections indicate that non-metropolitan regions will be more affected during recurrent epidemic waves compared with the initially heavier-hit metropolitan regions. Our findings have consequences for disease forecasts and resource utilisation.",

Generally, when a fully susceptible population is exposed to a new and contagious pathogen, an epidemic starts with an initial seeding phase when a small number of individuals are infected. Unconnected local outbreaks with unpredictable spread can occur due to variability in individual behaviour, the effects of potential 'super-spreading' events, and the non-uniform success of containment measures. This is followed by a phase of free exponential growth, during which 'track and trace' based containment is no longer feasible. Exponential spread of infections I(t) = e (\u03b2\u2212\u03b3 )t over time t happens at a rate 1/\u03c4 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 > 0 , where \u03c4 is the exponential time constant, when the average rate of new secondary infections caused by each primary infectious individual ( \u03b2 ) exceeds the rate of recovery ( \u03b3 ). Note that here 'recovering' is defined as ceasing to be both infectious and susceptible. By reported daily death counts 13 , the disease dynamics of COVID-19 have fulfilled the condition of exponential growth and decline in nearly all parts of the world. For four countries highly affected by COVID-19 and with reliable reporting indices, we utilise this epidemic data to estimate the fraction of sub-populations which remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, which is a key parameter governing the course of the epidemic.",

Slowing spread and ultimately reversal to an exponential decline can be driven by an increase of \u03b3 , through interventions such as anti-viral therapies that reduce infectiousness time. Such therapies were not available for COVID-19 during the study period. Consequently, reductions of new COVID-19 infections can only be attributed to reductions in either \u03b2 or S. Public health interventions aim to reduce \u03b2 through hygiene, physical distancing, and mobility restriction measures designed to reduce contact frequencies 5, 6, 15 . In the following analysis we argue changes in COVID-19 disease dynamics are due to reductions of \u03b2 and S, with different relative importance across geographic areas. In particular, a significant reduction of S is observed in the main metropolitan regions of the four countries investigated here.",

            "text": "While it is difficult to quantitatively associate a time-dependent reduction of \u03b2(t) with these data, the observed location data in Fig. 1B (also shown for additional investigated areas in Supplementary Fig. S1 ), as well as the representative transit station data in Fig. 2 (lower panels), indicate that the public response between areas within one country is similar in timing and magnitude of deviation from baseline. However, the seeding of the epidemic in each country's main metropolitan region (Italy-Milan/Lombardy; Spain-Madrid; England-London; USA-New York City) consistently occurs earlier than in the rest of the corresponding country, as exhibited in Fig. 2 (upper www.nature.com/scientificreports/ panels). As a consequence, the time period between initial epidemic onset and reduction of \u03b2 taking place (driven by public behaviour change) differs in a situation in which public behaviour is modified in similar ways and at similar times. We therefore consider pairwise comparisons of main metropolitan regions and rest of countries a suitable tool to investigate the relative impact of reductions in S. Note that for our analysis of Italy we focus on the Lombardy region, whose population is dominated by Milan-the country's largest metropolitan area. In addition, we used mortality data for England as a comparison for London, with the assumption that public health interventions in London best match those of England out of the whole of the UK. Figure 2 (upper panels) shows reported daily death counts 14, 21 for the four investigated countries, broken down into the data from the main metropolitan region and the rest of the country. Each of the corresponding eight data sets shows an initial exponential growth phase, followed by a transition to an exponential decline. Seeding of the epidemic consistently happened earlier in the metropolitan regions than elsewhere in each country, leading to higher population-normalised daily death counts in these areas. Yet, the time constant of the exponential growth is equal within errors for each metropolitan-country pair (except in the United States due to its heterogeneity), suggesting that the contact rate among a fully susceptible population is not critically dependent on factors related to population density 22, 23 . In contrast, the subsequent decline is consistently but to a varying extent faster in the metropolitan regions than in the rest of the country. Together with the notably earlier transition from the exponential growth phase and the observation that public policies within countries were similar, this indicates that the reduction of S played a more important role in the metropolitan regions relative to the rest of the country in all four cases. The extracted exponential growth and decline time constants are given in the Supplementary Table S1 .",

The results corroborate the finding that a reduction of S had already begun to reduce new infection rates in the metropolitan regions when public behaviour changes started to have a significant impact. The difference in the effect of S for all eight geographic areas is shown in Fig. 3 , where the peak number of daily deaths is plotted against the time delay between when visits to public meeting places are reduced and when death rates begin to slow (see \"Methods\"). The country-level data cluster around a common delay time that is similar to the reported average time between viral exposure and death 20, 24 . This suggests that the main driver for the initial reduction in death (infection) rates is changes in public behaviour. This is not the case for the metropolitan region data, which in turn cluster around a common peak daily death count. This clustering suggests that the larger early spread of the disease was sufficient to reduce infection and death rates through reduction of S in addition to the effects based on behavioural changes. Population-normalised reported daily deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (on a logarithmic scale) over the initial outbreak in early-2020, broken down into most populous metropolitan region (blue) and surrounding country (red). Data is shown together with fits and confidence intervals (see \"Methods\" for details). The stringency index is grey-scaled in the background, and has been shifted in time by +20 days to approximately indicate when the effect of public restrictions on death rates could begin to become measurable. This shift includes the expected period of 5 days from exposure to symptom onset, plus the subsequent mean period of 15 days from onset to death, reported in the literature 20 . Public transit station use (bottom panels) over the same period is also shown for comparison, with faded lines for real-time data and bold lines after applying the same expected exposure-to-death time-shift described previously. 26, 27 , and solve the differential equations simultaneously for each pair of country and metropolitan regions, with coupling between the two (see \"Methods\" for details). In this model, the population is assumed to consist of homogeneously interacting individuals, neglecting typically higher level of potentially infectious contacts within sub-communities than between such communities. This assumption can lead to systematic underestimates of fractions of residual population susceptibility. The solutions for each area are used to estimate S and the time dependence of it, as well as to explore the potential future evolution of the infection dynamics. We incorporate public behaviour changes into the system by adjusting the trajectory of \u03b2(t) equally for each metropolitan region and country pair, informed by Fig. 2 (lower panels). To evaluate the effect of initial public health measures on S, we only include the death counts until mid-May 2020, to avoid any effects of the relaxation of restrictions on the data.",

Using both approaches, we consistently find a comparatively weaker reduction in S outside the early-seeded metropolitan regions. Figure 4 shows the result of the model for the specific example of England and London, demonstrating that public policy interventions helped cap the death counts in both cases, but that a reduction of S is also a significant driver, particularly in London. Without relaxation of initial interventions, the model projects that containable infection levels would have occurred in mid-July and mid-August 2020 in London and the rest of England, respectively (solid lines c in Fig. 4 ). Note that this threshold was chosen to be 10 new daily cases per million population, in accordance with infection levels in countries with well-developed public health infrastructure (e.g. Figure 3 . The peak daily death counts from early-2020 plotted against the delay between public behaviour change and the deviation from exponential growth leading up to the peak. A correction factor from excess death data was applied to the reported rates (open circles) to derive the expected rates (solid circles), which are linked. The four countries exclude the corresponding metropolitan regions. The inset illustrates, for the example of England, a death count calibration by comparing reported COVID-19 deaths to the all-cause excess death data. Table 1 . Results of solving the SIR model with a time-dependent contact rate in each area. Ratios of susceptibilities are shown, along with the model-independent approach of analysing slopes for comparison. The model also provides absolute values of susceptibility S and infection fatality rate \u00b5 . The absolute value of S reported is that from mid-May, after stabilising at its new value for the time period studied (see Fig. 4 inset for the example of London and England). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ New Zealand, South Korea, Cuba, and Fiji), with proactive testing and 'track and trace' interventions, resulting in lasting containment approaching elimination of locally-acquired cases. In reality, a relaxation of restrictions (early-June 2020) and easing of travel restrictions were initiated. As a result, \u03b2 increased, and slowed down the decline in death rates. In a forward projection based on a continuation of these new conditions with no further changes to \u03b2 , containable infection levels in London and the rest of England could have been reached in mid-August and the end of 2020, respectively (dash-dotted lines d 2 ). As further relaxations are underway, these dates may be further delayed if no compensating changes in public behaviour are introduced to maintain the early-July value of \u03b2 = 0.135 day \u22121 . We note that this value is already greater than the observed value of \u03b3 (see \"Methods\"), and thus would have been enough to drive another period of exponential growth in the absence of any reduced susceptibility effect. We also model the hypothetical scenario of a full return to pre-intervention conditions, constituting the second wave (dash-dotted lines d 1 ). In this projection, infection rates begin to rise but the second peak for the metropolitan regions is reduced with respect to the first peak, while in contrast the second peak for countries is of higher magnitude than the first one, due to the fact that the height of the peak scales with S.",

This difference appears to arise solely from earlier seeding of the disease in these areas. Our data provide a method of upward revision to the reported prevalence estimates derived from laboratory testing. In addition, while infection and thus death rates are a function of S and \u03b2 , the effect of S reduction is more durable, and \u03b2 will rise whenever restrictions are relaxed unless protective measures prove to be fully compensatory. If they are not, a second peak may occur. The reduction in S would not necessarily avoid this, but would mitigate peak height. Forward projections based on the observed data also indicate that later-seeded areas are relatively more vulnerable in a second wave, which has implications for the distribution of healthcare resources. It is important to note that the first peaks in the scenario modelled without any interventions are significantly higher, and could lead to hospital admission numbers with a real risk of exceeding available capacities, which would in turn lead to an over-proportionally large negative public health impact with even larger death counts.",

For comparison, the REACT2 30 study of antibody prevalence finds a very similar ratio of 2.8 between London and England (excluding London) exposure. Similar calculations for Madrid/Spain and Lombardy/Italy yield ratios of 3.4 and 5.3, respectively, which are consistent with the values of 3.3 31 and 5.0 32 produced by each country's corresponding national seroprevalence studies from the relevant time period. While our absolute effective exposure levels are higher than the actual levels, the REACT2 study could underestimate current immunity levels by a factor of two or higher, as T-cell based immunity can exist with negative laboratory antibody response 10 . This factor of underestimated population immunity levels is time-dependent, as waning of antibody levels cannot be assumed to coincide with or be proportional to the timescales of waning immunity. The use of low blood volume finger-prick rather than standard high-volume samples derived from venous puncture, as well as testing bias introduced through inhomogeneous test responsiveness in the selected test population (albeit corrected for through post-stratification), are further limitations of the REACT2 study. The intrinsic underestimate of the remaining susceptible fraction of the population in our approach and the systematic overestimate of antibody serology studies such as the REACT2 study show that best estimates of the true value of S will benefit from a combination of both methods. While both methods are likely to provide more reliable quantitative information on relative values of S between different regions, a combined approach based on both population statistics and sufficiently large-scale serosurveys could be helpful deriving robust absolute values of S.",

It is possible that technological improvements will allow a successful track-and-trace strategy at higher infection levels. Forward-projecting continuations of modest relaxations of restrictions appears to make containment achievable, but observed slow down in the decline of death rates indicates that this will be reached later than would have occurred under more stringent restrictions. Mass vaccination programmes, not yet in existence during the timeframes studied here, can positively influence the infection dynamics. Our approach can be adapted to incorporate these programmes, as vaccinations further reduce S. In the simplest case, the initial value of S is adjusted to the size of the non-vaccinated population.

It follows that the contact rate is \u03b2 = (0.43 \u00b1 0.02) d \u22121 in an unconstrained population, and the recovery rate is \u03b3 = (0.130 \u00b1 0.013) d \u22121 , corresponding to a mean infectious period of (7.7 \u00b1 0.7) days, again consistent with the literature 39, 40 .",

This allows us to examine the ratio of susceptible populations between a metropolitan region (m) and the rest of its corresponding country (c) through the relation by measuring the time constants of the exponential declines.

These data are not available at a regional (sub-country) level, and are not a direct measure of actual public behavior. We use cellular device location data 19 to overcome both these limitations, and to evaluate the effect of PHIs. Such data are available for several high infection risk location categories, including retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. Progressively introduced use of personal protective equipment, in particular face masks, will generally play a role in reducing \u03b2 but in the time frame under investigation here this is not likely to be important as recommendations and significant population uptake occurred later in the course of the epidemic. We plot the cellular location data to show the relative change compared to the baseline value from the first five weeks of 2020 for each of the eight areas studied. Due to similarities of the relative timings and changes in magnitude of these measures, in principle any of them could be used as proxy for \u03b2(t) . Based on the comparably low noise level as well as the consistent and clear functional shape of the location data at public transit stations, we chose these data for our analyses. Transit data, shown in Fig. 2 (lower panels), includes use of subway stations, taxi stands, sea ports, and other travel-related locations. Empirically we find that the transit station location data are well described by a sigmoid function with a zero reference level (by definition the pre-pandemic normal level for early times t \u226a t 0 ). The remaining fitting parameters characterise the magnitude of the response ( TS l ), the time ( t 0 ) when the public behaviour change happened and time duration ( TS w ) over which the change occurred. As a comparable measure of the time when a significant reduction of \u03b2 is expected to occur, we choose the time t 50% when TS(t) is reduced by 50% from normal use as determined by the fit for each area, with the error determined as the one standard deviation functional prediction interval.",

On the logarithmic scale, the exponential growth and decline phases are transformed to increasing and decreasing linear slopes, respectively. Therefore, as a suitable model function for fitting we use which represents an interpolation between an increasing linear function with slope D u for t \u226a t 0 , and a decreasing linear function with slope D l for t \u226b t 0 . The temporal width of the transition between them is characterised by D w . This function corresponds to an analytically-integrated sigmoid (which itself is an interpolation between two constant values, representing the constant slopes). We then fit this model to the logarithm of the data in two steps: first, we individually fit the data at early and late times to linear functions using ordinary least-squares regression to obtain D u and D l , respectively. The results of this stage are shown as the dashed lines in Fig. 2  (upper panels) . These values are then used as constrained parameters of the full function Eq. (5) in a second fitting stage, the result of which is indicated by the solid lines in Fig. 2 (upper panels) . We use the full fits to extract both the peak value of the fit to D(t) and the time t 10% when D(t) reaches 10% of the value that would have been reached at the same time if the exponential growth trajectory had continued, indicated by the dotted lines in Fig. 2 (upper panels) . This is a measure of when the dynamics has significantly departed from the exponential growth regime, and begins to transition to a decline. This point is located close to the peak, but is not biased by the slope of the exponential decline in the same way that the peak time is. The error of t 10% is determined again as the one standard deviation functional prediction interval. For all fitting, we restrict data to a time window starting with exponential growth and ending just before the introduction of the first relaxation in PHIs where an uptick in TS(t) is observed (mid-May 2020).",

For COVID-19 dynamics, the attributed daily death rates are a more reliable metric than the number of confirmed cases, as they are not dependent on testing practices, and should be less prone to under-reporting. However, daily death rates are still subject to variations in reporting methods and in how each region defines what is classified as a COVID-related death 41 . Alternatively, excess deaths can be calculated by examining how many additional deaths (from all causes) have occurred above a baseline value that would be expected for the same time of year had the epidemic not happened 13 . While excess deaths statistics include deaths indirectly related to COVID-19 (for example, 'collateral' deaths due to healthcare systems being overwhelmed, or reduced visits to emergency departments), and the baseline value for expected deaths may not exactly reflect the current situation 42 (for example, in lockdown conditions the number of road traffic accidents will be lower than typical historical values), the number of excess deaths is nevertheless widely agreed to be the most reliable indicator to reflect the state of the epidemic, and alleviates some of the shortcomings associated with the reported daily deaths data 41, 43 . We compare the time evolution of D(t) (aggregated to weekly level) to that of weekly excess deaths during the spring of 2020 relative to the median value of the historical data up to the past five years, where available 44 . Accounting for the delay that it takes in processing and registering the deaths in each case, we apply a constant correction factor to the reported daily deaths. These factors faithfully reflect the registered excess deaths, and by area were 1.9 (Italy), 2.2 (England), 1.4 (Spain), 1.5 (US), and we found that these same factors applied equally well to each of the corresponding metropolitan regions, respectively. For the purpose of fitting analysis, we continue to work with the scaled reported deaths because these data are available at a daily granularity, whereas the excess deaths are only provided weekly. The scaling of the data is shown in Fig. 3 (inset) for the example of England.",

This means that not only the demographic composition of an (6) S = \u2212\u03b2SI www.nature.com/scientificreports/ investigated population needs to be considered, but also the dynamics of epidemic spread relative to it (e.g. the timing of seeding the virus in settings or population groups with specific demographic makeup such as schools, high-frequency business travellers or care homes). As a consequence, the infection fatality rates reported in the literature have varied, with some convergence in the range of 0.5-1% 53 . Findings outside this range with potential country to country variations may still occur and be meaningful as effective average figures. Possible changes of \u00b5(t) with time during the course of the epidemic have not been considered here, but are not likely to be important over the period studied in light of the high quality of exponential fits to the D(t) data. Since S is generally time-dependent over the course of the epidemic, we use a standard Runge-Kutta iterative algorithm to calculate numerical solutions of the system of differential equations [6] [7] [8] , and incorporate a time dependence to \u03b2(t) using Eq.

The individual cost functions for the metropolitan region and corresponding country are combined (with equal weighting) to simultaneously respect both sets of data in each pair, and a Nelder-Mead based optimisation method is then used to minimise this total cost function. This procedure provides our best-fit parameters for the epidemic dynamics.",

Constraining the values of \u03b2 in the metropolitan region and the rest of the country to be equal [\u03b2 m (t) = \u03b2 c (t)] is based on the assumption that public health interventions have equal effects on each area. This is supported by the observation that the time constants for initial exponential growth and the public behaviour changes (in timing and magnitude) are very similar for countries and their metropolitan regions following nationally homogeneously-imposed public health interventions, with the exception of the United States as already noted. The initial value of \u03b2 i is determined by the previously determined (see above) exponential growth phase time constant. Free optimisation parameters then relate to timing of epidemic seeding and the nature of the change in \u03b2 (namely t int and t w ).",

Then, rather than constrain our model by exactly these determined IFR values (which may be prone to systematic bias in the clinical data), we instead couple the fitting procedure between metropolitan region and rest of country by prescribing the ratio \u00b5 m /\u00b5 c in each case. The obtained ratios used as constraints for each fit were 0.664 (London/England), 0.985 (Lombardy/Italy), 0.887 (Madrid/Spain), and 0.854 (New York/US), and so the metropolitan regions have a generally younger population structure (and therefore lower effective infection fatality rate). Finally, the absolute values of \u00b5 are then returned as fit parameters (see Supplementary Table S1) , and are consistent with those reported in the literature 53 . An exception is the higher value obtained for Italy of \u00b5 = 1.95% , which may be attributed in part to a comparably older population structure, and potentially the increased impact on healthcare capacities.",

Data is shown together with fits and confidence intervals (see \"Methods\" for details). The stringency index is grey-scaled in the background, and has been shifted in time by +20 days to approximately indicate when the effect of public restrictions on death rates could begin to become measurable. This shift includes the expected period of 5 days from exposure to symptom onset, plus the subsequent mean period of 15 days from onset to death, reported in the literature 20 . Public transit station use (bottom panels) over the same period is also shown for comparison, with faded lines for real-time data and bold lines after applying the same expected exposure-to-death time-shift described previously.",

            "text": "disease. Exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaries) has been consistently considered the main source of primary human infection. Although Saudi Arabia reports the highest rate of human MERS-CoV infection and has one of the largest populations of dromedary camels worldwide, their spatial association has not yet been investigated. Thus, this study aimed to examine the correlation between the spatial distribution of primary MERS-CoV cases with or without a history of camel exposure reported between 2012 and 2019 and dromedary camels at the provincial level in Saudi Arabia. In most provinces, a high proportion of older men develop infections after exposure to camels. Primary human infections during spring and winter were highest in provinces characterized by seasonal breeding and calving, increased camel mobilization and camel-human interactions. A strong and significant association was found between the total number of dromedary camels and the numbers of primary camel-exposed and non-exposed MERS-CoV cases. Furthermore, spatial correlations between MERS-CoV cases and camel sex, age and dairy status were significant. Via a cluster analysis, we identified Riyadh, Makkah and Eastern provinces as having the most primary MERS-CoV cases and the highest number of camels. Transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans occurs in most primary cases, but there is still a high proportion of primary infections with an ambiguous link to camels. The results from this study include significant correlations between primary MERS-CoV cases and camel populations in all provinces, regardless of camel exposure history.",

They also found that in camel-exposed individuals, seroprevalence was significantly higher (15 and 23 times) in shepherds and slaughterhouse workers, respectively, compared with the general population in the study. However, only 2.4% of the 87 samples from shepherds and 3.6% of the 140 samples from slaughterhouse workers had serological evidence of infection. Another study conducted in Saudi Arabia reported higher MERS-CoV seroprevalence (53%) in camel workers using a cohort of 30 camel workers from the Riyadh New Camel Market and 44 controls from Saudi Arabia and the United States (Alshukairi et al., 2018) . These findings suggest that camel workers are probable intermediaries for human infection due to some humans' prevalent and continued contact with camels. Kandeil et al.

Results from this study show statistically significant correlations between primary MERS-CoV cases (with and without camel exposure) and camel clusters at the provincial level, which is consistent with F I G U R E 2 Total number of camels by province overlaid with the camel density in relation to the human population (camels per 100,000 people) by province Hemida, Elmoslemany, et al. (2017) . This correlation was more significant for camel-exposed groups compared with non-exposed groups, consistent with Alraddadi et al. (2016) . Asymptomatic carriers and mild infections that are less likely to be detected by a public health surveillance system might explain infection from humans for MERS-CoV primary cases without exposure to camels. This is supported by a nationwide survey in Saudi Arabia that estimated more than 44,000 individuals older than 15 years might be seropositive for MERS-CoV (Muller et al., 2015) . Primary MERS-CoV infection without camel exposure might also be transmitted by workers with occupational exposure to camels who have high MERS-CoV seropositivity rates with mildly developed disease (Alshukairi et al., 2018) .",

In past decades, peri-urban camel farming and camel festivals have attracted increased public interest in the Arabian Peninsula. In addition, camel dairy production and human consumption of camel products, including unpasteurized camel milk, have also dramatically increased. These changes could have significantly contributed to the massive spread of MERS-CoV within camel herds and the emergence of this zoonotic disease in humans (Faye, 2013; Faye, Madani, & El-Rouili, 2014; Gossner et al., 2016; Reusken et al., 2014) . The results also reveal that primary MERS-CoV infection and juvenile male camels are significantly linked, which could be due to their higher viral MERS-CoV RNA load compared with female camels (Alagaili et al., 2014; Elfadil et al., 2018; Hemida et al., 2013; Kasem et al., 2018) .",

Interestingly, Najran province, most of which is rural, had a very high camel density in relation to the human population and the highest incidence rate and excess risk ratio of primary MERS-CoV infection in the country. Additionally, most of the primary MERS-CoV cases in this province had been previously exposed to camels, which indicates that areas with high camel density are more likely to be hotspots for MERS-CoV transmission (Gikonyo et al., 2018) .",

Additionally, camel movements throughout the winter for grazing and participation in camel races and beauty festivals might be another contributing factor of camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission (Hemida, Elmoslemany, et al., 2017) .",

Fortunately, in June 2019, the Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture launched an electronic system for numbering and tracking camels using microchip implants to generate a national database (Ministry of Environment, Water, & Agriculture, 2019). This initiative will help improve the health status of camels through epidemiological mapping of camel-related diseases to support timely, preventive interventions and effective control measures. Data from the new camel tracking system can be used for detailed investigations at lower spatial levels to study the spatiotemporal patterns of camel movements and human interactions. Camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission is evident in most primary cases, but there is still a high proportion of primary infections with ambiguous links to camels. Results from this study show significant correlations between primary MERS-CoV cases and camel populations in all Saudi Arabian provinces, regardless of camel exposure.",

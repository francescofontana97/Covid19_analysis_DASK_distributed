During the acute phase of the pandemic, the Italian government decided on the lockdown which lasted about 2 months. During this period, all surgical activities were limited to nondeferable procedures only. The sudden closure posed problems with the management of the heart surgery waiting which at that time included 135 patients. Among these were selected cases with the worst clinical characteristics that were progressively operated on. Compared with a similar period in 2019, the cardiac surgery activity of the \"Lancisi Cardiovascular Center\" in Ancona has been reduced by 65%. With pandemic mitigation, heart surgery activity has gradually resumed but many open questions remain. Above all, there is the problem of living with a low but persistent level of presence of the virus with the need to organize the activity to ensure patients and staff safety and an optimal level of performance.

On the basis of collected experience from other centers around the country, we have learned that there has been an overall reduction in the activity of heart surgery centers, although unevenly distributed. For example, in the Lombardia region, the most affected by the pandemic, there has been a reorganization of the 20 heart surgeries present in the regional system (serving about 10 million inhabitants): 16 suspended the activity completely while 4 formed hubs. 8, 9 The Italian Society of Cardiac Surgery has also created a task force that has published some editorials, works, and position papers. The society started collecting data related to the outcomes of patients undergoing heart surgery during the lockdown period. 10 However, the collected data have not been published yet. Starting from March 8th, the hospital structure was gradually reorganized following the deliberations of the general management of the hospital to create specific areas dedicated to deal with the massive influx of patients with COVID-19.

Pandemic curve 3 | THE SARS-COV-2 IN THE MARCHE REGION The Cardiac Surgery Department of \"Lancisi Cardiovascular Center,\" part of the \"United Hospitals of Ancona\" in one of the highest volume cardiac surgery performer in Italy. Our department serves about 1.5 million inhabitants and is the only structure in which cardiac surgery is performed in the Marche region. Our department performs all types of adult cardiac surgery procedures: mainly coronary, valvular, and aorta surgery, and it is a center of excellence in the field of minimally invasive surgery and aortic surgery. There is also a percutaneous valvulopathy treatment program run by surgeons. Being the only regional cardiac surgery center, it also guarantees coverage for all cardiac surgical emergencies in the area. Before the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, approximately 1300 major procedures were performed every year, over 100 per month. The department had three dedicated operating rooms and an additional one dedicated to emergencies. It has a dedicated intensive care unit with 10 beds and a ward with 28 beds including 8 for subintensive care. The first cases of COVID-19 in the Marche region were recorded in the northern areas and related to a cluster involving the nearby Emilia Romagna region.",

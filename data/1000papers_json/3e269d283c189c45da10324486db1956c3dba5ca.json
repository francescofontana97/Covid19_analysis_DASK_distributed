Nine items of the scale were used because some questions were considered a potentially risky to trigger a pre-existing depressive condition (e.g., questions about suicidal ideation, the desire to take one's life, among others) in a scenario in which direct assistance to the respondent was not feasible. The SRQ-20 result classifies respondents into positive cases of depression when the sum of the scores is higher than 7; that is, more than 35% of positive responses. Thus, to adjust the outcome to this new application, we used the same proportion for the 9-item scale, created by separating the group into tertiles, in which the last tertile was considered to be of high risk for common mental disorders (scores higher than four).",

Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated together with their respective confidence intervals. A forest plot chart was built using the Cox model measures of effect.

First, our data were collected online and thus are not representative of the population of pregnant women, and may particularly underrepresent those who live in conditions of extreme vulnerability and thus do not have access to a smartphone and/or have difficulties filling out the survey. Therefore, our results may provide a best-case scenario of CMD prevalence. Second, we did not use all SRQ questions, since the risk of evoking depressive feelings after reading some questions was considered in a scenario of no feasibility of direct assistance. Moreover, we assessed mental health through questionnaires that are not capable to diagnose mental disease and does not apprehend in depth the feelings and perceptions of the interviewee.",

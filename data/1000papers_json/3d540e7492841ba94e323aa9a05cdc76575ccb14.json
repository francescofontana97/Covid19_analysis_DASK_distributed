Hospitals faced something unexpected, and they underwent a deep change and so did orthopaedic activity. Materials and methods In \"A. Gemelli\" University hospital new protocols were adopted for the safe management of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2. Among these patients, six had to be treated also for orthopaedic problems. The management of these patients, from the admission in the Emergency Room (E.R). to the operating room (O.R.), followed the protocols we developed for the coronavirus crisis. Results Four among the six patients underwent surgical treatments. Two of them showed a change of their clinical status, due to a worsening of COVID-19 symptoms, so the surgical option was postponed. All of them were admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit, rather than the Orthopaedic and Traumatology Unit, in order to provide the best measures to prevent the spread of the contagion and to ensure the best treatment for COVID-19. No O.R. staff was infected by SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions More studies are needed to provide a higher statistical significance to the safety measures taken in order to contrast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Surgical Room. Orthopaedic surgeons are more exposed to the contagion due to the particular tools set they use. A more sensible and specific quick test for novel Coronavirus is particularly needed, due to the lack of sensitivity of the serological rapid test.",

A fair balance between emergency surgery and elective surgery at the time of pandemic diseases has to be found. 1 For anamnesis we intended those information about the patient, suggesting a possible SARS-CoV-2 contagion, such as, for example, direct or indirect contact with a known infected subject or an history of travels in red-zones 2 The patient resulted negative at the first RT-PCR. She was still considered a suspected COVID-19 patient; thus, she underwent to the surgery as an infected patient. She underwent to another RT-PCR test right before the surgery, and the result was again negative. Therefore, she was considered a no-COVID-19 patient and sent to our Unit ",

None of the O.R. staff members resulted positive at SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test after taking part to the surgery. In particular, we need to adopt these protocols in the O.R., to protect the health workers from the contagion, and at the same time, allowing the patients to undergo important treatments they need, without causing any delay because of the coronavirus pandemic. Simultaneously, more studies are needed to validate the use of Rapid IgM/IgG SARS-CoV-2 Test, because at the present time they show a poor correlation with the RT-PCR results.",

            "text": "Fermatean fuzzy set theory is emerging as a novel mathematical tool to handle uncertainties in different domains of real world. Fermatean fuzzy sets were presented in order that uncertain information from quite general real-world decisionmaking situations could be mathematically tractable. To that purpose, these sets are more flexible and reliable than intuitionistic and Pythagorean fuzzy sets. This paper presents a novel hybrid model, namely, the Fermatean fuzzy bipolar soft set (FFBSS, in short) model as a general extension of two powerful existing models, that is, fuzzy bipolar soft set and Pythagorean fuzzy bipolar soft set models. Some fundamental properties of the proposed FFBSS model, namely, subsethood, equal FFBSSs, relative null and relative absolute FFBSSs, restricted intersection and union, extended intersection and union, AND operation and OR operation are investigated along with numerical examples. In addition, certain basic operations, including Fermatean fuzzy weighted average and score function of FFBSSs are proposed. Furthermore, two applications of FFBSS are explored to deal with different multiattribute decision-making situations, that is, selection of best surgeon robot and analysis of most affected country due to COVID-19 ('CO' stands for corona, 'VI' for virus, 'D' for disease, and '19' stands for its year of emergence, that is, 2019). The proposed methodology is supported by an algorithm. At the end, a comparison analysis of the proposed hybrid model with some existing models, including Pythagorean fuzzy bipolar soft sets is provided.",

Zadeh (1965) was the first who initiated a magical tool to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty, namely, fuzzy set (FS) theory. FS theory has shown meaningful applications in several real-world problems. Many multiattribute decision-making (MADM) problems have been solved by FS theory (see Chen and Jong 1997; Chen and Niou 2011; Chen et al. 2009; Chen and Wang 2010; Lin et al. 2006) . In a FS g, for any object # of the universe, it has one membership degree, i.e., 0 g\u00f0#\u00de 1, which could not always be fit to solve some MADM problems.",

Several fruitful researches based on IFS theory have been completed in different domains of science (Chen and Randyanto 2013; Chen et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2020; Zeng et al. 2019; Zhang 2020; Zou et al. 2020) . In an IFS, all the objects of the universe are characterized by both the membership and nonmembership degrees, whose sum is always bounded by 1. However, if their sum is greater than one, then the IFS will no longer be able to tackle such situation. Therefore, to remove this deficiency, a novel concept was developed by Yager (2013a Yager ( , 2013b , namely, the Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) as a generalization of IFS. It is a very efficient mathematical tool for handling the vagueness and imprecision in data.",

Currently, FFS theory is playing a vital role in various domains because it is a strong concept to deal with imprecise and vague information in Fermatean fuzzy environment. To illustrate this claim, suppose that some old men are enduing their opinion to youngsters about the society, half group of old men is giving a degree to traditional society as 0.77 and the other half is giving a degree to modern society as 0.87. It can be readily seen that 0:77 \u00fe 0:87\u00a31 and 0:77 2 \u00fe 0:87 2 \u00a31 but 0:77 3 \u00fe 0:87 3 1. Thus, FFS model is more flexible than IFSs and PFSs (see Fig. 1 ).",

For example, in Chinese medicine, Yin and Yang are the two sides. Yin is the positive side, while Yang is the negative side of a system. Motivated by these concerns, Zhang (1994) developed an idea of bipolar fuzzy set model. Like bipolar extension of fuzzy set theory, Shabir and Naz (2013) proposed the concept of bipolar soft set (BSS) as bipolar extension of soft sets. The idea behind the production of BSSs is the existence of parameters having opposite meanings in a decision-making situation. Afterwards, Naz and Shabir (2014) presented the concept of fuzzy BSS and its applications in decision-making. Akram and Ali (2020) developed two novel hybrid models, namely, Pythagorean fuzzy BSSs and rough Pythagorean fuzzy BSSs, and solved some MADM problems. Later on, Akram et al. (2020a) presented two novel MADM models, m-polar fuzzy BSSs and rough m-polar fuzzy BSS. For better understanding about the advantages and limitations of the literature, the readers are suggested to Table 1 .",

In a similar manner, Bipolar soft model is not capable to tackle data in Fermatean fuzzy environment. Therefore, there is a need of such hybrid model which have characteristics of both these models. \u2022 The MADM based on FFSs show that the variation in nonmembership values will definitely affect the membership values of the objects. \u2022 Till today two powerful extensions of the bipolar soft set theory have been introduced, namely, fuzzy BSSs (Naz and Shabir 2014) and Pythagorean fuzzy BSSs (Akram and Ali 2020) . There is a deficiency in these model, that is, greater values of membership and nonmembership evaluations cannot be taken. Therefore, they can not applied in a situation where datasets contain evaluations in Fermatean fuzzy environment. Thus, there is a necessity of a novel model which not only remove this drawback of existing models but also a generalization of the existing models. \u2022 Inspired by the existing theories of FFSs and BSSs, we present a more generalized model for MADM to cover the deficiencies and imperfections of the existing models. Our proposed model has ability to deal with data in both Fermatean fuzzy and bipolar soft environments. technique to describe its significance and authenticity as compared to some existing decision-making methods.",

At the end of nineteenth century, when the PUMA 560 (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly or Programmable Universal Manipulation Arm 560) robotic surgical arm was employed by Kwoh et al. (1988) in a delicate neurosurgical biopsy, a non-laparoscopic surgery, the first recorded use of a robot-assisted surgical technique took place. Robotic surgery helps doctors to perform certain types of complicated cases more accurately. To treat a wide variety of conditions, hospitals have rapidly adopted surgeon robots in the United States and Europe. The term ''robotic'' usually misguides people. Robots do not execute surgery, your surgeon conducts surgery with da Vinci (surgeon robot) via instruments that the surgeon guides through a console. The robotic surgery system translates your surgeon's hand gestures at the computer in real-time, bending and rotating the instruments while conducting the operation. The tiny wrested types of equipment move like a human hand, but with an excellent motion range. The surgeon robot vision system also delivers highly magnified, three dimensional (3D) high-definition views of the surgical area. The instrument size makes it possible for surgeons to operate with one or a few small incisions. Surgeons who utilize the robotic system can easily see that for several techniques, it improves the control and flexibility during the operation and permits them to better see the location, as compared to other traditional procedures. Suppose a hospital wants to select the best surgeon robot to assist the surgeons in critical surgeries. This critical task is given to the team of three senior doctors. Let V \u00bc f# 1 ; # 2 ; # 3 ; . . .; # 15 g be the set of 15 surgeon robots under consideration, and G \u00bc fl 1 \u00bc great accuracy; l 2 \u00bc high agility; l 3 \u00bc leadership; l 4 \u00bc ambidextrous; l 5 \u00bc stereoscopic vision; l 6 \u00bc automationg be the criteria for judgment of surgeon robots.

Now the team of expert doctors of the hospital decide to evaluate each surgeon robot, according to the chosen subset L \u00bc fl 1 ; l 2 ; l 3 g of parameters.

COVID-19, being a novel viral disease affecting humans for the first time in the large scale. The COVID-19 pandemic, which had firstly detected in China in the end of 2019, has infected people in 188 countries. the spreading rate of this virus was exponential region-wise but now its rate is decreasing. Currently, the infected countries are banning gatherings of people to decrease the spreading rate of this virus. Several countries are locking their population and enforcing strict quarantine to decrease the spread of the damage of this highly contagious disease. With the emergence of COVID-19, it has paralyzed every domain of life like education system, economies, industries etc. The developing countries are sure to hit to be hard, due to this virus. Till date, around 100 million people infected from which 55.4 million recovered while 2.16 million died with this virus. Now different countries invented the vaccine of this deadly virus, including China, USA. Our main goal is to develop an application for the evaluation of the most affected country due to COVID-19 pandemic. Here we select few prevailed countries whose fields are mostly disturbed. Suppose there is a set of fifteen countries V \u00bc f# 1 ; # 2 ; . . .; # 15 g and let G \u00bc fl 1 ; l 2 ; . . .; l 6 g be a collection of parameters(affected fields) under consideration.

            "text": "\u2022 Merits of the proposed model In the last few decades, a rapid progress in the uncertain modeling to tackle vague information is the evidence of this worthy topic. The wish to produce novel uncertain models and their hybridization is a limitless procedure due to the occurrence of numerous real-world decision-making uncertain problems. Undoubtedly, BSS model and its fuzzy and Pythagorean fuzzy versions are emerging as very useful mathematical tools. Nowadays, a more general model is needed which contains the characteristics of existing models (that is, more than one). Motivated by this thriving trend, a novel hybridization called FFBSSs is proposed which can handle the real data in Fermatean fuzzy bipolar soft environment. The presented FFBSS model is more feasible and reliable to handle uncertain information in different MADM situations. Especially, when the under consideration information containing parameters having opposite meanings in decision-making procedure. One can readily see that existing decision-making methods, that is, FFBSSs cannot consider the nonmembership degrees of objects under consideration in a MADM situation while PFBSSs cannot deal with the membership and nonmembership values whose sum of their squares is greater than 1. However, our proposed FFBSS model has ability to tackle both fuzzy and Pythagorean fuzzy bipolar soft information. \u2022 Comparative analysis with existing models Many fruitful soft computing hybrid models such as FFBSSs (Naz and Shabir 2014) , Pythagorean fuzzy BSSs (Akram and Ali 2020) and m-polar fuzzy BSSs (Akram et al. 2020a ) have been proposed in the literature to tackle different kinds of uncertainties in several MADM problems. But the above-mentioned models contain some flaws in their structure like both FFBSS and mpolar fuzzy BSS models only consider membership values of objects regarding favorable parameters and PFBSSs only consider the membership and nonmembership values whose sum of their squares is less than 1. The invention of two powerful models, namely, intuitionistic fuzzy sets and Pythagorean fuzzy sets is enough to prove the significance of nonmembership part in several decision-making processes. Fermatean fuzzy sets are emerging as an efficient tool to deal with uncertain information as compared to intuitionistic and Pythagorean fuzzy sets. In view of this fact, FFBSSs are presented in this study to deal with Fermatean fuzzy bipolar soft information. Note that existing MADM approach based on Pythagorean fuzzy BSSs (Akram and Ali 2020) cannot be applied for dealing with proposed applications in Sect. 3 but developed MADM method based on FFBSSs can be used to solve MADM applications in Akram and Ali (2020) . Thus, we have applied our proposed decision-making method on the datasets of Applications 1 and 2 in Akram and Ali (2020) . One can easily see the significance of the developed FFBSS model by its comparison with PFBSS model (Akram and Ali 2020) which is displayed in Tables 18, 19 , 20 and 21. Clearly, ranking order and optimal decision objects are similar. Therefore, our developed MADM method is more feasible and reliable than existing Pythagorean fuzzy BSSs. \u2022 Limitations The major limitation of the proposed hybrid model is the existence of two sets of parameters, membership and nonmembership scores of alternatives with respect to these two sets of parameters, because in many MADM problems, the computational speed may be obtuse due to several parameters. It is a common drawback in several existing hybrid models which can be easily overcome with the appropriate coding of the algorithms using software such as MAPLE and MATLAB. Another deficiency of the proposed FFBSS model is that the rank of the alternatives may vary when new parameters (or alternatives) added or any existing parameters (or alternatives) removed in a provided MADM problem. The principal cause behind this occurrence is the autonomous behavior of parameters and alternatives.",

We have discussed some fundamental properties of FFBSSs, namely, subset-hood, equal FFBSSs, relative null and relative absolute FFBSSs, restricted intersection and union, extended intersection and union, AND operation and OR operation. Our new hybrid model characterizes uncertain information more accurately and precisely than certain existing hybrid models like Pythagorean fuzzy BSSs. With the help of essential functions, like Fermatean fuzzy weighted average and score function of FFBSSs, we have constructed two applications of FFBSS to tackle different MADM situations. Further, we have designed an algorithm to support our proposed approach. At the end, we have compared our developed model with some existing hybrid models. In the future, we will try to extend our research work to (1) Interval-valued FFBSSs, (2) Fuzzy parameterized FFBSSs, and (3) q-rung orthopair fuzzy BSSs.",

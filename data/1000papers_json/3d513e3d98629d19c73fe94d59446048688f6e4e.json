Recent evidence has described the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f biologic plausibility that IBD patients may have differential risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 as the receptor for the virus, angiotensin converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2), appears to be differentially expressed in inflamed IBD mucosa with upregulation in the colon but downregulation in the small intestine. 15-17 SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression also appears to be impacted by IBD medications, with infliximab notably being associated with decreased ACE2. 17 Recent reports from large cohorts have provided evidence that IBD patients do not appear to be at increased risk of COVID-19. IBD patients in the US Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system had a similar incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 compared to the general VA population (0.23% versus 0.20%, p=0.29). 18 Similar results were seen in two European population-based cohorts. The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with IBD in the Netherlands compared to the general population was comparable (287.6 versus 330.0 per 100,000 patients, p=0.15). 19 A population based cohort study from Denmark found that patients with IBD may actually have lower prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 than the general population (2.5% versus 3.7%, p<0.01). 20 Further, patients with IBD receiving immunosuppressive medications do not appear to be at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. 21, 22 Humoral immune response against SARS-Cov2 leads to the production of antibodies of different classes and serological testing is another tool to assess SARS-Cov2 infection prevalence. 23 Studies from Italy and Germany showed a similar SARS-Cov2 seroprevalence in IBD patients treated with biological therapy as in general population. 24 The sum of these data suggests that IBD patients are not at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. However, it is important to note that these findings may be influenced by social behaviors during the pandemic, in particular the potential for patients with IBD to be more likely to \"shield\" or social distance due to perceived higher risk.",

In contrast, a separate EHR-based study across 31 institutions compared 232 patients with IBD diagnosed with COVID-19 to propensity matched controls without IBD and found no differences in COVID-19 hospitalization or mortality. 25 Among patients with IBD, as in the general population, key risk factors for more severe COVID-19 infection appear to be advancing age and the presence of comorbid conditions. In the initial report from SECURE-IBD, the primary outcome (ICU/ventilator/death) was observed in 37 (7%) of 525 patients overall. However, among patients over 60 years of age 10/101 (20%) experienced this outcome versus 0 of 29 pediatric cases (<20 years). 4 Older age (>65 years) was also demonstrated to be significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality in an Italian multicenter cohort (OR 19.6, 95% CI 2.95-130.6). 8 Additionally, the number of non-IBD comorbidities is also a risk factor for more severe COVID-19.

In the original report of COVID-19 from Wuhan, China, 48% of the hospitalized patients had digestive symptoms, which were most often diarrhea and abdominal pain, although most of these patients also had concurrent respiratory symptoms and fever. 30 Subsequent studies have confirmed these symptoms as well as nausea and vomiting, with the duration of diarrhea (defined differently) varying from 1 to 14 days. [31] [32] [33] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention subsequently added digestive symptoms of anosmia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting to the list of presenting symptoms associated with COVID-19. 34 The presence of these symptoms suggested the possibility of viral entry through the intestinal mucosa, further supported by prior research identifying expression of ACE2, the site of viral binding and endocytosis, throughout the intestinal tract. 17 Also of interest is whether the presence of digestive symptoms predicts the severity of COVID-19. A pooled analysis of multiple studies demonstrated that abdominal pain was associated with increased odds of severe COVID-19 (OR 3.93 [95% CI 1.64-9.38]), but there were only marginally increased odds with nausea or vomiting (OR 1.65 [95% CI 1.06-2.57]), and no association with diarrhea. 35 However there are conflicting data as a recent report on hospitalized COVID-19 patients observed that those with digestive symptoms on admission had lower mortality. 36 The question of whether there is fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV2 also has not been resolved.",

The vast majority of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 experience robust IgG antibody responses against the viral spike protein and have titers that are stable for approximately 5 months which significantly correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. 37 However, it is still unclear if the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 will be attenuated in IBD patients. Data from Germany showed a lower seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in immune-mediated disease patients on cytokine inhibitors compared with general population although this was not confirmed in a recent study in which biological therapy, including vedolizumab, did not prevent the mounting of an efficient humoral response to SARS-CoV2. 9, 24 Longitudinal seroprevalence studies are necessary. Another aspect to consider is whether the virus may impact the host immune response by inducing autoantibodies, triggering cross-reactive antibodies, or altering IgA-microbe interactions in the gut. Studies have highlighted the possibility that COVID-19 could induce pathogenic autoantibody formation both in adult and pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 and in COVID-19 patients who developed neuropathology. 38 These will be important questions to consider as we address the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on IBD.",

We advise that patients should continue on prescribed medications with the exception of corticosteroids which should be tapered off or to lowest possible dose. In addition, de-escalation of combination therapy with thiopurine and anti-TNF should be considered in high-risk patients in stable remission. While the association between J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f severe COVID-19 and mesalamines requires further data, we would recommend limiting their use in situations of low clinical value (Crohn's disease and after escalating to biologic therapy in ulcerative colitis). Given that lack of adverse impact of biologics on COVID-19 outcomes, patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 may be able to either continue or avoid prolonged holding of needed medications. A summary of clinical implications and recommendations is provided in Table 1 .",

Use of steroids in patients with IBD at or prior to infection may allow a greater degree of viral replication early in the course of illness while treatment of later-stage infections with prednisone may blunt the cytokine storm characteristic of more severe cases with respiratory failure. In addition, data have suggested that mesalamines may be associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. 4,5 However, the effect size of this association has attenuated with time and given the unexpected nature of this finding and potential for unmeasured confounding, requires further investigation. 4,5 Reassuringly, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy has not been associated with more severe COVID-19. An analysis of 600 cases of individuals with rheumatic diseases demonstrated that anti-TNF therapy was associated with a reduced odds of hospitalization (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.81). 26 In an analysis of nearly 1500 cases reported to SECURE-IBD, Ungaro et al demonstrated reduced risk of severe COVID-19 in patients treated with anti-TNF monotherapy versus anti-TNF in combination with thiopurine or thiopurine monotherapy. 5 More data are needed to fully evaluate the safety of other classes of IBD medications, though to date no clear signals have been observed with methotrexate, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, or J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f tofacitinib. 5,10 As a side note, there are active trials of anti-TNF as well as JAK inhibitors therapies (tofacitinib and baricitinib) as treatments for COVID-19. 27-29",

Then, these features were used to generate classifier models to predict whether a COVID-19 case would be severe or nonsevere based on machine learning. Two test sets of data from the two hospitals were gathered to evaluate the predictive performance of the models. Results: A total of 455 patients were included, and 21 features showing significant differences between the severe and nonsevere groups were selected for the training and validation set. The optimal subset, with eleven features in the k-nearest neighbor model, obtained the highest area under the curve (AUC) value among the four models in the validation set. D-dimer, CRP, and age were the three most important features in the optimal-feature subsets. The highest AUC value was obtained using a support vector-machine model for a test set from Huoshenshan Hospital. Software for predicting disease progression based on machine learning was developed. Conclusion: The predictive models were successfully established based on machine learning, and achieved satisfactory predictive performance of disease progression with optimalfeature subsets.",

            "text": "By November 22, 2020, more than 180 countries had reported a total of 57.8 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, a condition caused by SARS-CoV2. 1 SARS-CoV-2 is a novel enveloped RNA \u03b2-coronavirus, which has phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV, the pathogen causing SARS. 2 The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 have a broad spectrum, and vary among individuals. 3 Most infected individuals have mild or subclinical illness, while approximately 15.7%-32% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients develop severe acute respiratory distress or are admitted to an intensive care unit. 3, 4 Potential risk factors to identify patients who will develop into severe or critical severe cases at an early stage include older age, underlying comorbidities, and elevated D-dimer. 5, 6 As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, it is critical to find patients at high risk of disease progression. Several investigations have analyzed risk factors associated with disease progression and clinical outcomes, and suggested that older age, comorbidities, immunoresponse were potential risk factors. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] However, the clinical details were not well described, and many important laboratory results were not included in the analyses. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective classifier model for predicting disease progression at an early stage. Machine-learning techniques provide new methods for predicting clinical outcomes and assessing risk factors. Here, we aimed to predict the disease's progression with machine learning, based on a large set of clinical and laboratory features. Performance of the models was evaluated using clinical data of multicenter-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Software was developed for clinical practice. These predictive models can identify patients at high risk of disease progression and predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients accurately.",

Clinical characteristics, WBC count, inflammatory markers, liver function, renal function, and coagulation functions were collected and utilized to establish the predictive model based on machine learning. In sum, 21 features with significant differences between the severe and nonsevere groups were selected from a total of 48 features. In this feature-selection process, relatively useless features were eliminated to make the calculation more effective. Finally, the optimal-feature subset was determined using k-fold cross validation for each method. Moreover, the predictive performance of the models was evaluated by two test sets from two hospitals, ",

In our study, these models were trained by optimal-feature subsets to attain optimal predictive performance. We evaluated predictive performance with two test sets from two hospitals to ensure the reliability of the models.",

Zhou et al found no significant differences between a nonaggravation group and aggravation group for WBC count, CRP, albumin, LDH, or D-dimer level. 10 They found that total lymphocyte count was a risk factor associated with disease progression in COVID-19 patients using a binary logistic regression model. 10 However, only 17 patients were included in this study, and total lymphocyte count did not reflect disease progression. Zhou et al showed that older age and elevated D-dimer could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. 6 Consistently with this study, age and D-dimer level were important features in the optimal-feature subset. Elevated levels of D-dimer are associated with disease activity and inflammation, mainly including venous thromboembolism, sepsis, or cancer. 14,15 A retrospective study on deceased patients also showed that D-dimer was markedly higher in deceased patients than recovered patients. 16 Therefore, monitoring the D-dimer levels can help clinicians identify patients at high risk of disease progression. Anticoagulation treatment can be given patients with high D-dimer levels to prevent disease progression. Albumin levels decrease significantly in most severe COVID-19 patients and decrease continuously during the disease's progress. 17 Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor clinical outcomes for hospitalized patients. 18, 19 Hypoalbuminemia in severe patients is mainly due to inadequate nutrition intake and overconsumption.",

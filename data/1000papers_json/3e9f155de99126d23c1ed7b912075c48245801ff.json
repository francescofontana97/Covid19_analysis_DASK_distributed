For competing risks data, the corresponding quantities of interest are cause-specific hazard ratios (CHRs) and subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs). However, they all have some limitations related to model assumptions and clinical interpretation. Therefore, we introduce restricted mean time lost (RMTL) as an alternative that is easy to interpret in a competing risks framework. We propose a hypothetical test and sample size estimator based on the difference in RMTL (RMTLd). The simulation results show that the RMTLd test has robust statistical performance (both type I error and power).",

The other approach is the subdistribution hazard function (SDH), which refers to the instantaneous rate of the event of interest in subjects who have not yet experienced the given event. The statistical test is the Gray test, and the estimated effect of one group relative to another, i.e., the subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR), can be calculated by the Fine-Gray model. Meanwhile, the descriptive statistics for clinical or epidemiological interests are described by the cumulative incidence function (CIF), the probability of one event of interest occurring by a particular time in the presence of other events, which reflects the risk of the cause of interest without ignoring the presence of other competing events.",

The RMTLd-based results provide us with a more acceptable conception of the time scale. At the same time, based on different time points \u03c4 , we calculated the RMTLd-based sample size at the chosen time and the SHR-based sample size (20) for comparison.

Essays about students' thoughts and experiences were thematically sorted and revealed a variety of sentiments spanning from positive (e.g., pride, respect) to the more negative (e.g., anxiety, guilt, disappointment, anger). Themes revealed respect for the healthcare profession, but also the realization of its limitations, sacrifices, and risks. Healthcare profession educators need to be aware that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected students emotionally and may have long-term effects on the global healthcare profession. This study can serve as a historic documentation of how this generation of students felt and adds to the literature on how the pandemic affected the healthcare profession.",

Specifically, the coders received anonymous essays that were blinded for originating school, gender, and age-only after the thematic coding was completed was this information revealed. The assignments were coded in two phases. In phase 1, the coders read all the essays and identified themes for each of the guided questions. All coders agreed on the themes before proceeding to the next step. In the second phase, the responses were then categorized into the coded themes using Excel\u00a9. The project team met regularly to resolve discrepancies and achieve consensus. Discrepancies included disagreement on interpretation or categorization of the content. Consensus was achieved via majority vote. If no consensus was achieved, the essay was excluded. Once all the essays were coded, the written pieces were identified and sorted by schools.",

This report confirms the findings about emotions during pandemics in general [20] ; particularly, during the COVID-19 pandemic [20] [21] [22] [23] . These emotions may lead to mental health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety, but can also result in positive outcomes such as personal growth and resilience in the long term [14, 17] . Furthermore, during disasters, media exposure alone can have a psychological effect on students' emotions [24] . This could explain the ubiquitous presence of fear and anxiety among students who live in countries that were minimally affected by the pandemic at the time. Therefore, it may be advisable for schools to offer crisis support to students of this generation, as previously suggested [25] . Professional identity formation has recently been investigated and is a several-phase process [26] . It was reassuring to see that the severity of the pandemic was not associated with students having doubts about their choice of profession.",

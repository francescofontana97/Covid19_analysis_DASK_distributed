Although I make the case that Oakland's discourse is distinct in a number of ways, I also conclude that the locale is one of many other Black colonies in the United States with a legacy of Black, Latinx, or poor youth responding to trapped oppression with organized, visualized, and vocalized resistance to abusive state power. A thorough examination of the underground development of political content from other inner-city American locales that had BPPSD chapters and/or a substantial presence of radical Black Nationalist organizations in the mid-1970s would likely reveal unique transfers of underground power from the Racial Justice Movement to rap music, involving unique local factors and unique types of music. Thus, there is a substantial need for future studies of local political content and rap music in colonies across the United States and worldwide. With the current popularity and commercialization of many hybrids of electronic dance music (EDM) and rap music, it is unclear whether it will become easier to differentiate local messages about internal colonies from mainstream music or whether this resistance will be layered in the new products. In focusing on messages of political power and subjugation, and to carefully examine the political content of local scenes, it would be more effective to conceive of the rap community as a collection of micro-scenes (each scene being a mid-sized or major US city) that can be linked through better methodological research.",

My quantitative finding-that local rap music contained nearly double the level of key political references than its mainstream counterparts-led to my qualitative analysis of both sets of sources and my central argument. Due to local, state, and national government failures to respond to the incessant violence, poverty, and poor social conditions in West Oakland, East Oakland, and other sections of the San Francisco Bay Area, a particular form of resistance was created, nursed, and eventually exported. Centrally, this form of resistance was remarkably and strikingly different from most other forms of politics during the BPPSD era, and other forms of rap during the gangster and hyphy eras. When compared to much of the mainstream Civil Rights Movement discourse and the vast majority of mainstream rap music, the Oakland discourse is more militant, more radical, and ultimately, deeper in its systemic critique of \"the state.\" As such, it is of vital importance to understand the local discourses as a form of political communication during tumultuous times for Black, Latinx, and poor youth located in inner-city America.",

As an evolution, one can look at the trajectories of Oakland's reality-based subgenres that heavily used quotidian narratives as a means of transforming subaltern positions into sources of power by using violence as a currency or common language. As a negation, local rap music remained a capitalist product; often spoke about illegal and detrimental capitalist development; in some (or many) cases used violence indiscriminately directed back at the local community; and did not overtly seek to unite individuals into a new political framework. Yet, local rap music harnessed the politics of visibility, last resort, and disregard for oppressive institutions, as explained in the next section.",

Although both sounds largely ignored or rejected positions promoted by the Panthers, the hyphy sound's roots in the locally developed subgenres nevertheless continued in the local tradition of critical discourse. Specifically, it did so by using unpredictable and \"crazy\" behavior to threaten a reclaiming of public spaces. The local brand continued to document current struggles in vivid detail, while most Billboard artists used their previous existence in the inner city as a way of exhibiting dangerous roots and thus staking a \"claim to fame\" to gain popularity. There is a clear \"post-hyphy\" music currently being created in Oakland, and it differs from \"trap music\" and rap's fusion with electronic dance music-common radio styles as of this writing.",

Primarily, gangster rap's added shock value in its ability to display violence, tell vivid stories of urban existence, and place the listener within urban, militarized space was combined with alternative frameworks in Oakland. This created a brand that effectively employed quotidian politics and day-to-day accounts-a method used previously by late 1960s and early 1970s Black Nationalist groups and leaders. Here, even the anecdotal became powerful-chock-full of hidden meanings, euphemisms, and double entendres available to insider listeners and passed over by outsider listeners. This key link between the BPPSD's political discourse and the music that arose thereafter is a distinguishing feature of the Bay Area sound. Indeed, the development of local rap music in Oakland, the East Bay, and the San Francisco Bay Area is a vital case due to its historical roots in radical and militant Black Power, initial thematic development during the rise of the gangster rap subgenre, and geographical positioning north of the digital age capital. While a handful of local rap artists reached audiences outside of Oakland, the vast majority remained contained within the Bay Area underground.",

            "text": "My goal in this book was to examine political content in Oakland. However, the content analysis method used in the book could be applied to other US cities and regions, other international cities and regions, other genres, subgenres, and micro-subgenres, other media formats essential to popular and underground culture, or other academic disciplines, research questions, and examination foci. For example, the idea of building a locally informed, collective, and authentic \"discourse bank,\" \"soundbank,\" or \"media bank,\" that documents longitudinal trends could be used beyond the fields of Political Science, Critical Race Studies, or Urban Politics. As I detail in the next section, this type of adaptability is the center of this comparative-micro-scenes approach. There is certainly a need for additional work and deep, book-length studies of underground discourse banks. With a handful of exceptions, most of the other 24 rap scenes do not have comprehensive examinations using local underground sources as primary source material. In addition, Oakland should continue to be reexamined with a focus on another aspect of underground culture or formed from a different \"reading\" or a different \"test.\" As detailed in the introduction, there about 25 scenes with major influence on rap music evolution in the By mapping out the discourses from these cities, researchers would be able to capture most of the major rap genres, subgenres, and microsubgenres in the United States. 2 This book examined Oakland, and other books have focused on certain cities within the NY/LA axis and in the South, but generally, the 25 scenes above are devoid of book-length academic work on the relationship between political content and rap music. There are very few exceptions to this rule. The ones that exist are exceptional, as in the case of Matt Miller's Bounce. An example of this essential type of local rap music coverage of the LA rap underground told in Eithne Quinn's Nuthin' But a \"G\" Thang and in Marcyliena Morgan's The Real Hiphop. 3 Both books are written about art and culture in the LA scene and employ a different methodology than that used in RAP, and to my knowledge, there has not been comprehensive examination of the political content of LA rap music. Even the Oakland scene could be reexamined with a new focus. Kwame Harrison's Hip Hop Underground is a comprehensive study and it is fully immersed in the scene, and Harrison's main focus was on forms of identification. 4 There are many other US micro-scenes (and nearby scenes in other countries) that also warrant independent, book-length studies beyond these 25 micro-scenes. Scholars and multimedia practitioners should also continue to map and compare international cities and regions. These micro-scenes are ready for exploring questions about transformations of urban political environments and local power brokers, and the relation of music and art scenes to those concerns. Studies could consider questions about the connection between post-industrialization and crime, access to production technologies, the role of political organizing, and beyond. Perhaps the main question, though, is how does hip-hop culture grow in that community? Does rap music grow in that locale? If, so, what are the distinctive traits in message and sound? How, when, why, where, and for how long do these sound movements stay around?",

Once again, 2Pac is one of the best examples of this process, because his albums began to sell as whole units to the mainstream. This is significant because if a teenager heard a 2Pac song on the radio in the early 1990s, she would have to go to the store to buy a CD single or the full album.

Well, I argue that there is a macro/micro paradox that exists. There is a macro paradigm centered on using mainstream sources (especially sources with extensive music video and radio airplay) to tell us about political content in rap music in general and even to tell us about rap music on local rap music scenes. The micro-scene-level data that exists at the local level is hardly ever recognized, formally or meaningfully examined, or even authentically sought after by many academics who study hip-hop culture or rap music. The lack of micro-scene studies is probably mostly due to emotional costs. To truly attempt to know a rap micro-scene at an \"on-the-block\" level can take over one's mind, body, and soul-and it can be taxing in other ways if is a researcher's home or place of origin. In addition, there are also pressures to sell books and for academics to get published in great journals.

In analyzing the actual messages and claims made by local artists, scholars can examine the validity of the claims, inform policymakers, and reduce the need for rap artists to continue to use violence, hustling, and contempt as chief modes of making their voices heard by the outside public. Yet, this proposition also creates a problem: intense micro-and ethnographical investigations of individual scenes require a different set of costs than macro-investigations. Although the costs and challenges of this research method and possible solutions must be considered, I suggest that the research method, local findings, and relationship to other Black colonies forwarded in this study can help foster more accurate and relevant ethnographic-centered studies of political content and rap music in other urban undergrounds.

This has led two very popular types of research ideas regarding rap music-and especially gangster rap music.

Second, rap music (and particularly gangster rap music) is sometimes understood as a vile, disgusting, and immature product of hatred that perpetuates false ghetto stereotypes, violence, misogyny, and homophobia.

Others have had issue with the level of critique offered by rap: \"Although hip-hop encompasses more than rap music, rap music is not only the most consumed aspect of hip-hop but is arguably the easiest form to infuse with politics.

All of the examples below were drawn from my \"test\" of the Bay Area sources against the Billboard sources, so each was found in a scientific manner of random sampling, testing, and experimentation. Organized regionally, prominent East Coast Queens and Brooklyn rapper appeared; West Coast rappers from Compton and South Central Los Angeles appeared; rappers from the South were represented by Atlanta, Houston, Memphis, and New Orleans; and the Midwest and North were represented by rappers from Philadelphia and Chicago. This does not mean the 15 other major rap micro-scenes around the country do not have political content. Rather, it means that in this random test, I was able to verify some level of political discourse appearing on the Billboard for the eight to 10 scenes below. If a researcher were to dig deeper into any of these scenes, they would likely find very high levels of political content.",

            "text": "In the rap albums era, a few Billboard artists displayed the threat of organized militancy through the display of firearms by groups. In 1993, Long Island, New York rap duo EPMD's Business as Usual cover highlighted an ambiguous but heavily armed police clampdown. Years later, in 1999, the cover of New Orleans rap group Hot Boys' Guerrilla Warfare flaunted a less than ambiguous threat of organized militancy with an exploding cop car-as if the rap group would oversee the annihilation of law enforcement. 13 Some artists depicted guns as necessary to survive on the streets by displaying them in a variety of poses. The exhibition of firearms began with Ice T's Power, the cover of which displays a woman with a gun as a primary offensive threat-through the fact that she is scantily clad and leaning on the gun rather than wielding it somewhat undermines the potential threat she poses-while the back cover reveals that the two men pictured are also holding guns, but shielding them, suggesting that the men focus on defense. The cover image and its attachment to the term \"power\" suggest that control is directly attached to having access to a firearm. Later, Detroit rapper Bo$$' Born Gangstaz album depicted the female rapper as heavily armed, implying that you did not want to meet in her alleyway without a gun. 14 Similarly, South Jamaica Queens, New York group Onyx's Bacdaf*cup album and Sacramento, California group DRS's Gangsta Lean both suggested that without a weapon of your own, journeying through the inner city would result in a beating, a gun whipping, or worse, and that you did not want to venture onto their block without the necessary tools to defend yourself. 15 Perhaps the clearest message attaching the display of firearms to survival appeared on Compton-based rapper Eazy-E's 1994 release It's On (Dr. Dre 187um) Killa; even while drunk, high, and alone, the rapper was armed and ready. 16 A year later, Compton-based rapper Eazy-E signed a group of rappers from Cleveland, Ohio, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. Their artwork continued to depict urban strife in similar ways to Eazy-E. 17 This is evidence of a cross micro-scene influence that is similar to 2Pac's influence on the Oakland and LA scene, Master P's influence on the East Bay, CA and New Orleans, LA scenes, Too $hort's influence on the Bay Area, LA, and Atlanta scenes, Scarface's Houston-based Rap-a-Lot Records investments in East Bay, CA artists-among countless other examples.",

Out of New Rochelle, New York, Brand Nubians' In God We Trust flaunted the destruction of American currency as a radical anti-state symbol. This action (illegal under Title 18, Section 333 of the US Code), paired with the album's title, rejected the dollar and its use of that phrase, symbolizing a rejection of both capitalism and the state. 18 Brooklynbred Junior M.A.F.I.A.'s Conspiracy showed Black youth as the targets of surveillance and prosecution with artwork that clearly exhibited that, even while the group was on trial, the state was still seeking evidence to use against them. 19 Public Enemy, a group with Long Island, New York origins, released Greatest Misses and Apocalypse 91\u2026The Enemy Strikes Black effectively branded the notion of repression and victimhood. By presenting a Black torso in crosshairs and with missed rounds, the group made the statement that America was (unsuccessfully) trying to kill off the Black man. 20",

            "text": "The paradigm of the urban wasteland was also reinforced through Billboard songs such as on Queens, New York's Mobb Deep's \"Shook Ones Pt. II\" from The Infamous, which offered a vivid warning from \"official Queensbridge murderers\" to outsiders who wanted to \"profile and pose.\" The outsiders would quickly find that they were all alone in the streets, as the inner-city dwellers would see the fear on the outsiders' faces as they would be \"laced up with bullet holes and such.\" 21 In addition, the music video opened with a kitchen scene depicting the production of crack cocaine and elements of gang life. Both the song and the video reinforced the urban paradigm, but it went further and deeper than previously done on a mainstream level. Artists such as New York's Wu Tang Clan's Genius/GZA used similar tactics in \"Cold Word\" on Liquid Swords, which painted a chilling picture of the ghetto warzone by describing New Year's Eve full of constant gunfire, crying babies, men dying and being arrested, and running from police while shooting back at them. 22 Later, Compton, California's Coolio released a hit single \"Gangsta's Paradise\" that interjected a socially conscious (and even biblical) meaning by comparing walking through an LA ghetto to walking \"through the valley of the shadow of death,\" and noted the chilling emulation of gangsters by children. 23 Meanwhile, artists from the South further contextualized urban crisis; examples included OutKast and Goodie Mob from Atlanta, Georgia and-to a lesser extent-Eightball (or 8Ball and MJG) from Memphis, Tennessee. On ATLiens, OutKast's \"Elevators (Me + You)\" discussed changes in the inner city, rapping about \"rats\" in the \"hood\" and the transformation of a woman who wants to sing but turns to prostitution for money. On On Top of the World, Eightball's title track discussed never forgetting the Orange Mound neighborhood streets he came fromincluding \"the drugs, the violence, not one day of silence\" and \"the robbing, the shooting, and mothas prostitutin'.\" On Soul Food, Atlantabased rap crew Goodie Mob's \"Cell Therapy\" discussed moving into a project building with a gated serial code, ongoing drug and gang activity, and a curfew as \"traces of a new world order.\" The group pondered whether the \"gate was put up to keep crime out\" or to keep them in. The chorus described people looking in the window (\"Who's that peeking in my window\") before being fired upon (\"POW! Nobody now\"). 24 Some artists on the Billboard mentioned the hood that they left behind but would never forget, and a final shift in this vein of discourse proposed offering hope to those in the projects and assuring them that life would go on. Examples of this included Houston rapper Scarface, Queens rapper Nas, and Brooklyn rapper Jay-Z. Nas and Newark rapper and singer Lauryn Hill's rendition of Harlem rapper Kurtis Blow's \"If I Ruled the World\" (from 1985) flipped the lifestyle of running from the police, thug life, and selling drugs into dreaming of a rap millionaire lifestyle. 25 On The Untouchable, Scarface's \"Smile (featuring 2Pac)\" featured an introduction from the deceased rapper explaining that there would be things in the future that would make it hard to smile, but suggested that keeping a sense of humor could help people keep their \"head up.\" Oakland rapper 2Pac's verse discussed the lifestyles of inner-city Black males as being \"stranded\" in a \"land of hell, jail, and crack sales\" in an attempt to \"hustle\" into material wealth. The rapper balances recollections of burying friends and living poor in the projects with urging his listeners to follow his lead and smile. 26 Signs of the commercial turning point in rap music were fully apparent by the time Jay-Z's \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\" drew a comparison between inner-city poverty and the riches to be gained as a celebrity. His flagship song featured a sample from a chorus line in the Charles Strouse musical Annie. The sample features children singing \"It's the hard knock life for us.\" On the verses, Jay-Z rapped about his inspiration for rapping, saying that he rapped for those \"smoked out\" on marijuana and locked in jail cells. 27",

The album sold listeners through radio-friendly songs such as \"Ms. Jackson\" and \"So Fresh, So Clean,\" but also contained some sly political content. The cover image featured the two rappers standing in front of a black-and-white American flag with their arms pointed toward the camera-a seemingly political, anti-state symbol. Although the meaning was not explicitly clear, we can infer by their positioning, the discoloration of the flag, and the first song that they were making a statement about the United States. Moreover, their first video was \"B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad)\"-the 11th song on the 24-track album-which featured a fast-paced lyrical expression about a war culture in America. Even more telling was the first song after the album's introduction, \"Gasoline Dreams,\" which started with another fast-paced tempo and included the lyrics, \"burn, baby, burn American dream.\" In many ways, OutKast's cover and leading singles were inviting the listener to a deeper conversation about race and American politics. 30 The fact that this was the lone militant or anti-state image from the Billboard chart reflects the shift from albums to digital singles, as well as the role of commercial aims at achieving a wider audience. Digital rap singles did not require the elaborate liner notes associated with rap albums. In addition, artists were now widely releasing free mixtapes as promotions for their single and albums.",

In many ways, Eminem's rise demonstrates that problems of poverty in America sometimes transcend class. Terror Squad rapped about divided territory and youth trauma as a claim to ghetto authenticity; \"Lean Back\" described the Bronx as an area where children love to shoot guns, and the group stated that half the people in their rap crew had a \"scar on their face.\" 33 Other artists began to display the status and treatment of celebrity. Atlanta rapper Yung Joc's \"It's Goin' Down\" included an introduction about being from \"Ghettoville U.S.A.\" and \"College Park\" before raps about being approached by fans in the streets asking where he lived. The rapper then designated the setting as a place where they \"cut up\" stolen cars and detailed his celebrity in the area. As he explained, everybody loved him because he was \"so fly,\" and the people who saw him passing flashed peace signs (\"deuces\") as he rode by. Yet, he also rapped that the federal government was also on his trail on the suspicion of him selling drugs. 34 Some rappers also issued lyrical warnings that even as rich superstars, they could quickly return to their former ghetto lifestyle. These included emerging rappers such as Young Dro-who rapped about his Bankhead roots and described sleeping next to banana clips and drug addicts 35 -as well as established artists such as Bronx, New York's Fat Joe, Atlanta's T.I., Brooklyn's Jay-Z, and Long Beach, California's Snoop Dogg. For example, Fat Joe rapped that his nickname was \"Crack\" in the rough area he came from (due to drug pushers), and that outsiders needed an invitation or pass due to the heavy street code 36 ; T.I. rapped about the ghetto as \"an area that's shaded grey,\" saying he prayed for patience but others made him want to \"melt their face away.\" 37 Meanwhile, Jay-Z rapped about New York as a melting pot of crack dealers on street corners and hip-hop roots through Afrika Bambaataa, describing a place where foreigners \"for[get] how to act,\" 38 and Snoop Dogg rapped about having threats \"turf stomped\" because he was the \"turf punk.\" 39 Again, these were mostly established rappers who were calling on a former persona to stay current, revalant, and as a lasting claim to authenticity.",

Radio-ready raps such as \"Kryptonite (I'm On It)\" by the Atlanta crew Purple Ribbon All-Stars had verses about the police smelling weed from a vehicle and calling in canine officers; however, the rappers claimed to have a \"tough team of attorneys\" and a crooked, dirty judge-both likely ensuring a \"not guilty\" verdict and meaning they had no problem being searched. 43 Other rappers issued a threat of a return to former lifestyles and anecdotal references to police. For example, on LA entertainer Jamie Foxx's \"DJ Play a Love Song,\" Chicago, Illinois' Twista rapped about no longer running from police and instead making songs, though he also issued the threat that he was always a gangster, came from the streets, and had guns for \"whoever [thought] they want[ed] some.\" 44 Other rappers offered anecdotal references to police in passing or as a form of common sense, as in Atlanta rapper Young Jeezy's \"Lose My Mind,\" when guest collaborator Plies rapped, \"F*ck the police, 'cause all of 'em problems.\" 45 Miami rapper Rick Ross' \"The Boss\" used the controversy to provoke his listener by warning which warned his listener about being a \"lame lil' homie\" working for the police while pretending to know him. 46 Overall, these cases demonstrate that the discourse of resistance to law enforcement remained centrally important over all of the time periods discussed.",

Currently, a major issue in Oakland is related to gentrification, 47 which produces complex problems for youth living in areas with long-standing racial tensions and inequalities. As one author writes about Oakland: \"Today, even as it becomes increasingly diversified and gentrified, the city's spatial politics continue to reverberate, in both emancipatory and oppressive ways, with the imaginary of Oakland as a space of Black rebellion. Blackness, in other words, looms large in the city-its reputation, its representational politics, its archives-in ways that, in my experience, are significant for struggles over the cultural landscape.\" 48 Ultimately, this author also found issues with policing, as \"young people of color tend to be policed according to their perceived proximity to this stigmatized Blackness.\" 49 In this new housing market, as one author writes, Oakland has found a need to balance economic interests against the criminal justice system interest with measures such as \"gang injunctions.\" 50 As another author argues, Oakland is distinct for a number of reasons and two of them include being a \"global center of information technology\" and the fact that it is \"undergoing one of the most dramatic urban makeovers in the country.\" 51 Perhaps it is even useful to think about two images of Oakland's future power struggles-one from the recent film Fruitvale Station and the other from the recent film Black Panther. Both films were directed by Oakland native Ryan Coogler.",

            "text": "Fruitvale Station provided a day-by-day and play-by-play depiction of the January 1, 2009 killing of a 22-year-old Black man named Oscar Grant III at the hands of a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) police officer at the Fruitvale Station in Oakland. Grant was unarmed, and he was handcuffed facing the ground. This film, one of the first of its kind, highlighted Grant's attempt to be a better father, partner, and citizen before being shot and killed. This moment was in many ways one of the first high-profile, live broadcast/streamed killings of a young Black man by a police officer in the United States-five years before the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. It also was part of the inspiration for the Black Lives Matter movement creators. According to one founder, Omi, the mixture of seeing Fruitvale Station, the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin, and the killing of Michael Brown (and others) led to a conversation-which ended in the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter (#BLM) being used. 52 Thus, the killing of Grant was a proto-#BLM tragedy, a warning sign, and an example of the importance of understanding local protest politics. Its depiction in film was extremely powerful and moving. Meanwhile, we are told that the \"murder of Oscar Grant represents a long-standing pattern of violence in Oakland.\" 53 This event was also another example of devastation after a set of rising expectations. The Grant killing occurred months after some local youth helped mobilize in the election of Barack Obama and got involved with \"awareness and promotion of 2008 presidential voting.\" The devastation occurred as: \"His actual murder was recorded on several cell phones and instantly uploaded on YouTube garnering viral exposure.\" This impacted the politics of local youth to turn from political to more radical means-another long-standing tradition in the Oakland/East Bay. 54 The first possibility of what Oakland's future could look like is depicted in the film Fruitvale Station. 55 While the events leading to Oscar Grant's death are still hotly debated and contested, what is clear is that this tragedy was the latest incident in a town with a long history of resistance against police and \"the state.\" In fact, the Grant case is merely another example of continued police brutality, racial profiling, and ineffectiveness in \"The Town.\" These were some of the main issues recognized by the Party in their October 1966 formation. The film Fruitvale Station was also a key catalyst for the idea of sending out the mid-July 2013 #Black-LivesMatter message, which has influenced public conversations about many things related to oppressed people. Grant's case also inspired a group of activists that addressed a different type of police brutality-the killing of unarmed Black youth by police officers across the United States. Yet, this campaign was clearly influenced by the BPPSD-the former upstart that effectively connected the history of brutality and racism by local police forces targeting the Black, Latinx, and poor populations in West Oakland to the mistreatment of all oppressed people in the United States and around the world.",

            "text": "Black Panther offers another visionary future for Oakland. The film featured an ironic mix of mainstream and local sources from Oakland. Coogler prominently featured Oakland in parts of the 2018 Marvel superhero blockbuster. Although Oakland is depicted as the impoverished, oppressed counterpart to the utopian land of Wakanda, the film highlights a particular brand of Oakland Black art, culture, and politics. The film begins with a local scene in 1992, showing young boys playing basketball in an empty lot before panning to an apartment building in which TV coverage of the LA riots can be heard. It is clear that someone with a core understanding of Oakland's underground politics was involved with the film. During the opening scene, Too $hort's local classic \"In the Trunk\" blares out of speakers. The villain of the story is from Oakland, and his background during the gangster rap era motivates his destructive goals, but also allows for a level of empathy given his difficult past. As one scholar has said, \"Oakland infuses the entire movie and growing up as an African American and at the same time having this perfect like utopia that you don't [have] access to kind of motivates the character.\" 56 Coogler's depiction of real Oakland problems in the middle of a fantastical world offers a level of escapism, especially with the intervention by Wakandans at the end, but also puts Oakland in the public eye for viewers around the country. Some would also argue that many of the costumes bore some loose references of the original Lowndes County Freedom Organization logo-which the Black Panther Party for Self Defense later used.",

The Bay Area has many questions to answer. Like many communities, the Bay Area will need to confront questions about the COVID-19 response and its aftermath. It should be noted that much of the COVID-19 response has been a process of local reporting leading to regional, national, and international data sets. It should also be noted that the BPPSD was one of the first mass movement groups calling for health care reform as a human right. Will the Oakland and East Bay Black, Latinx, and poor communities be disproportionally impacted by this crisis in the same way the Black community has been disproportionally impacted in places like Chicago? Will Bay Area officials take the housing crisis seriously and do something about it? Will the gentrification and displacement trends be addressed? Will police harassment and poverty remain the common markers of the Black experience in the Bay Area, and the United States as a whole? These are the questions with which the Bay Area is faced in the coming years and decades. Politics (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2011), 5. 11. This is a variation on the question: \"How have things been for you this week?\" used in groundbreaking programs. I am thankful for the work and research that Julia Pryce and the Erikson Institute are doing regarding this question in the \"Training on the Mentoring FAN\" program. Pryce's research on this topic and her training sessions for Arrupe College of Loyola University Chicago faculty advisors have been essential in helping asking the right questions in conversations with advisees. This simple (but brilliantly worded) question is at the heart of meeting advisees \"where they are at.\" It also could potentially provide a great starting point for writing impactful lyrics.",

Survey design could begin with questions such as: What are the top 10 albums from your city?; What are the three films that give the most accurate picture of your town?; Who is the most famous rapper from your area?; Name any rappers in your region who are famous (or legendary) in your community but who are not as well known outside of your community? The dialogue, debates, and discussions from initial questions like these will inevitably lead to a question about criteria, a trip down memory lane about songs that we forgot about or about artists we forgot were from that city, and maybe somewhere down the line to a consensus on how to have the discussion about raking the top 10 albums or films or whatever. These ranking systems-whether real or online-are great modes of getting an idea of the layout of a scene and how to build a discourse bank using local texts and sounds. The aim of these questions is to get at larger questions to get a more accurate understanding of the discourses built in cities after the first and second Great Migrations. As a researcher, I would be interested in a number of questions. How are these crisis moments in American political development (APD) experienced locally? What does the underground political response sound like? How can we use this information to form soundbanks to provide more authentic samples of underground political content from other urban centers? What is the influence of earlier movements and sounds, producer and consumer technology, or other locales and regions? Finally, what is the given scene's impact on other locales, regions, and times?

For applications to education, see Talmadge C. Guy, \"Gangsta Rap and Adult Education,\" New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education 2004, no. 101 (2004). Gilliam's article turned to a Motivational Education Entertainment Corporation research study of young urban Blacks in a set of cities (Baltimore; NY; LA; and Long Beach, CA; Oakland and Richmond, CA; Chicago; New Orleans; Detroit; and Philadelphia; and Atlanta). She used quantitative data such as the finding that: \"Three out of every ten black youth listen to the radio more than four hours daily.\" Tanji Gilliam, \"Hip-Hop and Politics [Memo],\" Black Youth Project Website, http://www.blackyout hproject.com (accessed January 5, 2010). Then Gilliam used this information to evaluate racial behaviors to compare them to research studies of both white and Black attitudes. This study in particular, and the above studies in general, effectively used rap music to gain information about hip-hop music. 10. Lester K.

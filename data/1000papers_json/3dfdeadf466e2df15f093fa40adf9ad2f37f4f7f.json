Anxiety, depression, increased alcohol and substance use, distress, anger, insomnia and increased risk of suicide have been reported, whilst risk factors for mental disorders such as loneliness and domestic and physical violence have also been highlighted. Individuals with existing mental health challenges have been identified as being particularly affected due to a lack of continued psychiatric care services [5, 6] . Furthermore, the pandemic has put a greater strain on the mental health of various groups including homeless persons and migrant workers who have been rendered more vulnerable due to socioeconomic repercussions. Many healthcare workers have experienced significant fears of contagion and of spreading the virus to their families, friends or colleagues. Additionally, as highlighted in prior research on such severe epidemics, it is expected that the mental health impact of the current pandemic is not short term but rather is likely to continue for a long period even after the pandemic ends [7] .",

            "text": "Within this scenario a dire need for safe communication channels targeting mental health challenges has arisen. The restrictions of face-to-face contacts have identified mental health helplines as one such channel. Such helplines enable the person to log in daily and make timely contact with support services. This can mitigate isolation, as well as address themes of fear, uncertainty and stigmatisation. Despite the significant impact of such helplines, there is a dearth of research on the impact of the COVID-19 scenario on calls made to mental health helplines, with five studies being extracted from the general literature. Three of these studies [8] [9] [10] report the activity of mental health helplines specifically set up as a response to the pandemic in Greece, India and Nepal, respectively. Peppou et al. [8] analysed data from a random sample of 576 calls out of a total of 1728 calls made to a nationwide helpline over a 3-week period following the outset of restrictive measures, whilst Ravindran et al.'s [9] study examined data from 20,475 calls during the four weeks when the country was in the state of lockdown. Both studies highlighted the initial preponderance of anxiety symptoms and demonstrated that the majority of calls comprised concerns specific to COVID-19, such as fear of the illness and issues relating to quarantine. Whilst Peppou et al.'s [8] study revealed a greater percentage of callers identified as having clinically important depression (i.e., 37%) versus that for anxiety (i.e., 20.3%). Correspondingly, Ravindran et al. [9] highlighted that most of the initial calls were related to anxiety, but over time people were calling because they were grappling with depression and substance abuse. Conversely, in another study by Shakya [10] , 102 calls made to a helpline run by a single centre over a one-week period were examined. The major concerns of callers revolved around closure of services and unavailability of medications and only 3.33% of calls related to fear of the coronavirus. Two other studies [11, 12] examined symptom profiles and concerns of callers to nationwide established helplines in Switzerland and Australia, respectively, both prior to and during the pandemic. With regard to symptom profiles, Titov et al. [12] observed a small but significant increase in anxiety symptoms but no differences in levels of psychological distress, depression or suicidal thoughts, whilst Brulhart and Lalive [11] identified small increases in loneliness and struggles attributed to life adjustments during lockdown. In their study, Brulhart and Lalive [11] also identified the need for research exploring trends in helpline calls made as lockdown restrictions were lifted.",

A significant association between the number of calls by month (\u03c7 2 (9, N = 2908) = 2298.14, p \u2264 0.001) was obtained with a greater number of calls recorded over the months of April (n = 973; 33.4%), May (n = 494; 17.0%), August (n = 311; 10.7%) and October (n = 328, 11.3%). From a total of 2908 calls, 62% (n = 1803) were females. Approximately half of the calls made over two months, namely April (56%) and May (43%), were COVID-19 related. During the Pre-COVID versus COVID phase, 57% versus 80.9% of calls, respectively, were for personal reasons. The first local deaths due to COVID-19 were reported during the month of April (n = 4) with the modal category for number of monthly deaths being that for October with 27 deaths. A significant association was detected for number of COVID-19 cases by month (\u03c7 2 (7, N = 2908) = 9502.1, p \u2264 0.0001), with a greater number of cases diagnosed for the months of August (n = 1144), September (n = 1178) and October (n = 2984). Week 1 corresponds to the first week of March and week 35 corresponds to the week ending 31 October. In March, 86 calls were made to the helpline amounting to 2.9% of the total number of calls made. During this month, no deaths from COVID-19 were registered and the total number of cases diagnosed was of 169 cases, with a maximum of 17 cases on two -consecutive days, 22 and 23 March 2020. The month of April accounted for 33.4% (n = 973) of the total amount of calls made to the helpline of which 62.8% (n = 611) were made during weeks 6 and 7 (i.e., between 6 April and 19 April). This period corresponded to the: (i) first local deaths registered on the 9, 10 and 12 April and (ii) an increase in the number of cases during week 6, with two spikes in individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 on 7 (n = 52) and 9 April 2020 (n = 38). Table 2 presents the 10 most highly ranked causes for assistance from the mental health helpline. The highest ranked causes for assistance in the Pre-COVID phase (i.e., January-February) were information needs relating to mental health and available services (n = 60), depression (n = 59) and psychological distress (n = 51). Between the months of March and June, the highest frequency of calls related to mental health issues, namely anxiety, psychological distress, depression and loneliness. This period corresponded to the imposition of a partial lockdown followed by some easing of restrictions in May. For the months of July-August, the main reasons for call assistance related to informational needs (n = 128), loneliness (n = 92), psychological distress (n = 92) and depression (n = 92), whilst for September-October, assistance was requested mainly due to informational needs (n = 251), psychological distress (n = 114), anxiety (n = 98), depression (n = 89) and loneliness (n = 89).",

The present study contributes to this literature by analysing national helpline data over a 10-month period that includes comparative data from the 'Pre-COVID' and 'COVID phase', respectively. The decision to examine helpline data was influenced by its advantage as a research method as it provides a more reliable gauge of the prevalence and monitoring of distress and is in real time, as calls are logged in daily [11] .

Such information is of importance considering that this outbreak is ongoing, and the mental health impact of the pandemic is also likely to prevail long after the pandemic ends [5] . The present study highlights that although pre-existing counsellors in the community continued to provide their services either face-to-face (especially for persons with severe mental illnesses) and/or online during the COVID phase, yet as hypothesised, requests for helpline mental health assistance varied over time, with an increase in calls detected during the months of April and May (i.e., corresponding to spikes in COVID cases and the first deaths) and between August and October (i.e., corresponding to increases in the number of cases and deaths at the beginning of the second wave). Further ongoing research is required, however, on the mental health needs and concerns of people, as countries grapple with second and consecutive waves of COVID-19. Such information can provide a reference that can inform the development of responses in the eventualities of other waves of COVID-19 and may crucially inform any relevant interventions that can be formulated [14] . For instance, the present study has demonstrated that calls relating to family-related issues rose significantly during the initial months of the first wave and then again during the second wave, whilst requests relating to informational needs rose significantly during the second wave (i.e., September and October 2020). Hence, there is a need for governments to ensure that the mental health budget allocation adequately covers the increased burden being experienced by families such as care provision to the vulnerable that includes the elderly, persons with a mental illness and parents caring for a child with behavioural, psychological and/or physical challenges, amongst others. Furthermore, decision makers and helpline agencies should focus on strengthening community care services, such as through the training and upskilling of staff, that can target the increased mental health concerns and informational requirements of people. In addition, the application of technology-enabled services such as e health, m health and telemedicine provides the availability of online-based learning and self-help services, the opportunity for person-to person communication in real time whilst maintaining social distancing and the linking of informational requests to services available. Further research, however, is required to evaluate such services whilst determining the most effective means to target the provision of information to persons, especially the most vulnerable populations.",

An exception, however, is the study by Shakya [10] who reports that the number of calls expressing concern over service closures and unavailability of medicines grossly outnumbered COVID-19-related calls. The author suggests this is explained by Nepal's collapse of health services due to the poor development index status. In the present study, however, an increase in the number of COVID-19-related calls was identified in the month of April 2020, during which a partial lockdown was still imposed, coupled with the recording of the first deaths and spikes in number of persons diagnosed with COVID-19. However, the number of local calls for assistance also rose significantly during the months of August and October. This could be attributed to the local increase in persons diagnosed with COVID-19 following a series of mass events held in August, whilst in October, both the number of cases (n = 2984) and the number of local deaths (n = 27) rose. Additionally, in alignment with extant literature [10, 15, 16] , people were more likely to call discussing their concerns rather than those of others. Possibly when people are too distressed themselves, their capacity to look after others may be somewhat affected.",

Irrespective of the country of origin, methodology employed (cross-sectional surveys or analysis of helpline data) and measures, authors concur that psychological distress levels and loneliness increased considerably at the outset of the outbreak when heavy restrictions were imposed.

However, the present study contributes to extant literature by demonstrating that during the partial lockdown period and with the gradual easing of some restrictions (between April and June 2020), calls for assistance pertaining to mental health aspects (namely anxiety, depression, psychological distress, loneliness), financial problems (e.g., due to reduced working hours), medication management issues and physical health (e.g., sleep disturbances, chest pain, nausea) were significantly higher. This contrasts with calls made in the Pre-COVID phase that were significantly less in number and where calls for assistance pertained mainly to information needs and depression. The month of July was associated with a removal of social restrictions and the previous sharp increase in calls for assistance decreased and was noted to stabilise. A stabilisation in relation to number of calls over time also concurs with research conducted by Qiu et al. [18] . However, whilst we hypothesised that calls made throughout the COVID-19 period would relate to mental health challenges, we actually identified a decrease in calls requesting mental health assistance over the months of August-October (even though the number of deaths and cases rose). This may be attributed to the maintenance of social connectedness between individuals (albeit with some restrictions) and/or the use of denial as a means of coping with post-traumatic morbidity [21] as it reduces a sense of powerlessness during overwhelming stress. One can postulate that people in Malta were so overwhelmed psychologically during the first wave and subsequent partial lockdown that denial of the gravity of the situation is accounting for the stabilised levels of anxiety and distress in spite of a second extensive wave. Wang et al. [16] also posit that additional information on vaccines and an increased frequency of wearing masks also relate to improved mental health in persons.",

This reality poses challenges, however, such as a reduced ability to gauge body language and to effectively respond to acute psychiatric emergencies over the phone. Moreover, challenges pertaining to accessibility to all segments of the population, acceptability of these innovations by the general public and availability of resources to meet this demand need to be researched and subsequently addressed. Furthermore, the gauging of client satisfaction with mental health helplines and the use of interventions such as emotional freedom techniques constitute aspects that future research may address.",

This corresponded to a period when restrictions were gradually eased and eventually removed. Between August and October, an increase in the number of persons diagnosed with COVID-19 (i.e., August: n= 1144; September: n = 1178; October: n= 2984) and in the number of deaths was noted. Yet although the number of calls for assistance between August and October (i.e., August: n= 311; September: n= 204; October n: 328) did increase in comparison to the months of June and July, the levels attained did not reach those recorded during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., April: n = 973; May: n = 494).",

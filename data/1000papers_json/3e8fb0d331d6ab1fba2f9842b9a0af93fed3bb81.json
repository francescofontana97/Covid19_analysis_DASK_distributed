            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have long been considered inconsequential pathogens, causing the common cold in otherwise healthy people. 1 However, in the 21st century, two highly pathogenic HCoVs-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -emerged from animal reservoirs to cause global epidemics with alarming morbidity and mortality in 2003 and 2012, respectively. In December 2019, yet another pathogenic HCoV, SARS-CoV-2, was recognized in Wuhan, China, causing Coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) 1 and raising intense attention not only within China but internationally. 1 Since its first detection, COVID-19 has become a major health problem and the global outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11th, 2020. 2 To date, more than 31 million laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported worldwide with ~966,000 deaths in 184 countries, bringing the crude case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 to ~3.1%. 3 The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was reported on 29 January 2020. The UAE had 85,595 confirmed cases (10,104 active; 75,086 recovered; 405 deaths; CFR ~0.5%, as of 21st September 2020). 4 The COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding its transmission has caused considerable anxiety and fear around the world. [5] [6] [7] [8] Additionally, social distancing, quarantine and lockdown measures imposed by governments to control the spread of the virus have caused disruptions to businesses, employment and education. These disruptions have had multifaceted implications with a sharp rise of mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, stress, sleep disorders and substance use, particularly amongst university students. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Specifically, medical and dental students are psychologically vulnerable groups during these unprecedented times, due to the already highly competitive nature of their training, academic pressure, exposure to patients in clinical settings, financial constraints and lack of sleep; which may already contribute to psychological problems associated with stress and anxiety. [14] [15] [16] [17] Additionally, during disease outbreaks, healthcare students are perceived to be at higher risk of infection because of their increased risk of exposure to the virus during clinical training. 18, 19 This has led to higher reports of anxiety among medical students than non-medical students during previous disease outbreaks, 20, 21 particularly due to their fear of transmitting the virus back to their family and loved ones. 22 In March 2020, all schools and university programs across the UAE transitioned to online learning including clinical training and clerkships for both medical and dental students. The psychological impact of this transition for university students overall and the disruption it may have caused have yet to be investigated in the UAE particularly for clinical training of medical students. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, no study has yet estimated the effect of this pandemic on university students and its impact on the psychological well-being of students. In this study, we aim to assess university student's psychological distress and concerns during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, their degree of perceived information about the disease, and their overall attitude, practices and behaviors during the outbreak. We also evaluate students' perceptions on the precautionary measures in place and the effectiveness of educational strategies such as the use of online learning for reducing anxiety levels in the United Arab Emirates. This makes our study the first in the UAE to discuss this aspect in the current pandemic.",

Response options were \"not at all,\" \"several days,\" \"more than half the days,\" and \"nearly every day,\" scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Levels of anxiety were measured using the GAD-7 scale at three different time points.

The impact of COVID-19 on university students is particularly burdensome due to the perceived effect of the virus on their studies; and with medical students specifically, it could be due to the interdisciplinary nature of their training and the potential proximity of being exposed to the virus during their clinical studies. 27 Overall, students in our study demonstrated good knowledge of COVID-19 and reported using reliable sources such as official statements and press releases from the ministry of health and the WHO website. Although the use of these sources was higher among medical students, social media was the main source of information for both medical and nonmedical students. This finding is consistent with the literature and emphasizes the role that social media can play in risk perception and dissemination of reliable information during a pandemic such as COVID-19. [28] [29] [30] [31] However, other studies have also reported that young people tend to obtain a large amount of information from social media which can easily be a trigger and predictor for stress and anxiety. 6, 32, 33 Good knowledge may also explain students' compliance with hygienic practices in our study. Most students reported significant change in their hygienic behavior since the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly for increased hand hygiene, avoiding crowded places and avoiding being in contact with people with flu-like symptoms. However, even though levels of knowledge were significantly higher among medical students, compliance with hygienic practices was similar for both groups. Furthermore, we found significant positive correlations between changes in hygienic behavior and increased levels of anxiety. More than half of students who reported changed hygienic practices reported higher levels of anxiety, which is consistent with recent literature indicating that people who were more anxious about COVID-19 were also more engaged with regular hand hygiene and social distancing behaviors. 34 There is increasing evidence that the number of growing cases of COVID-19 globally and within the UAE is causing public worry and concern 35,36 and in the absence of vaccines and effective treatment, government authorities have introduced rules and restrictions. 37 Compliance and adherence with these restrictions has been found to differ amongst different age groups and populations, with less acceptance of these restrictions being reported amongst younger age-groups. 38 However, in our study, the majority of students did not consider the strict measures undertaken by the healthcare authorities as dysfunctional or not required. The students were worried about transmitting COVID-19 to their family members more than they were worried about catching the virus themselves, therefore, indicating a beneficial sense of social responsibility during such infectious disease outbreak. Similar concerns were reported amongst healthcare workers in Hong Kong and Canada during the SARS outbreak. 39, 40 The results from the current study confirm that anxiety levels due to COVID-19 among university students are high, ranging from mild to severe, especially amongst females, which is consistent with previous research. 5, 6, 17, 41 The majority of students in our study were females, which reflects the gender imbalance in higher education within the UAE. More than two thirds of students reported mild anxiety levels and one third of students reported severe anxiety. What makes this study unique, is that medical and non-medical students were compared, and within the medical student group, we compared medical and dental students. Furthermore, this study was conducted during a critical time at the onset of the pandemic and during the transition to online learning allowing us to assess anxiety levels at three different time points: during hospital visits for medical and dental students, before online learning and after switching to the online learning for all university students. Among the medical/dental group, students in their clinical phase of study who had rotations in high-risk wards or who had been in contact with COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher (moderate to severe) levels of anxiety, demonstrating that high-risk perception of COVID-19 may contribute to higher levels of anxiety. Medical/dental students continued attending the hospitals at the early onset of COVID-19 when fear and worry associated with the outbreak would have been at their peak and before lockdown restrictions were in place, which could also explain their high compliance with infection control measures. Medical students' high-risk perceptions associated with attending hospitals during infectious disease outbreaks have been reportedly associated with higher levels of anxiety 21, 31 and higher scores on fear scales and anxiety levels among health care workers. 42 However, when we compared between medical and dental students, dental students reported higher levels of anxiety and these remained significant with further multivariate analysis. Previous studies have established that medical and dental programs are highly Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress competitive, and students generally experience high levels of stress during their training. 43, 44 Yet, dental students suffer from greater levels of perceived stress than medical students due to their role as providers of care and earlier exposure to patients in the dental clinics. 45, 46 Furthermore, dental students are in very close proximity to patients and are dealing directly with patients' dental care during a potentially highly transmissible respiratory virus with increased potential to become infected due to the nature of the field itself. 47 This may explain the higher levels of anxiety among dental students in our study and the overall decrease in anxiety among all medical students following the introduction of online learning. Psychological support should be tailored to each student's needs and incorporated into the online remote curriculum. Screening university students on a regular basis with tools such as the GAD-7 could help faculty in the early identification of highly anxious students and guide students to receive help from targeted interventions that promote psychological well-being, offer pastoral counselling, mental health support and coping mechanisms. 48, 49 Non-medical students reported higher levels of anxiety before and after online learning in comparison to medical students and whilst medical student anxiety levels decreased following the introduction of online learning, non-medical students' anxiety levels increased. This may be due to several factors, including medical students possibly being more familiar with the use of online learning platforms, being distant from the perceived risk of COVID-19, or due to the variable sources of information about the pandemic among both groups. Knowledge of the virus might reduce students' fears and anxiety while inadequate understanding of COVID-19, its prognosis, transmission and control measures might contribute to negative implications and fear of the unknown 40 hence explaining the higher anxiety levels in non-medical students in our study.",

Firstly, the use of convenience sampling and its descriptive nature through an online survey may not allow the generalization of results especially since anxiety may be due to many other factors other than COVID-19 and which may not be captured through this method. However, considering the need for a rapid method to assess stress and anxiety in a vulnerable population during a rapidly evolving infectious disease outbreak, the use of an online survey serves as a promising method for quick results. 50 Additionally, responses were collected from four different emirates across the UAE with good response rate allowing for a certain element of representation. Secondly, the nature of self-reported data in the survey may lead to response biases specifically for hygienic practices where students may provide socially desirable responses and self-reported levels of anxiety, stress and worry which may not always be as accurate as being assessed by a mental health professional. However, despite these limitations, this study provides important baseline information which will inform further research and public health interventions in this area.",

Specifically, medical students reported higher levels of anxiety during their clinical rotations which decreased with the introduction of online learning, yet, nonmedical student's anxiety levels increased with online learning.

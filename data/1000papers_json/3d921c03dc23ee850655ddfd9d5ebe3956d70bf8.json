Consequently, COVID-19 was urgently classified as a Class B communicable disease and managed as a Class A communicable disease in accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Disease (2) . Meanwhile, the COVID-19 epidemic continued to spread around the globe, with rapid increases in case numbers in European and American countries, and a looming threat in resource-limited settings across Africa (3) . The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of May 25, the pandemic had spread to 188 countries on six continents, with a total of over 5 million diagnosed cases worldwide (4) .",

The novel pathogenesis of COVID-19 has produced varied epidemiological characteristics from previous coronavirus-derived pulmonary infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). SARS and MERS were rarely transmitted during the asymptomatic period (5, 6) . In contrast, increasing evidence indicates that individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 could be infectious during the asymptomatic incubation period (7) (8) (9) . Thus, knowledge of length and dispersion of incubation period is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and control. In addition, transmission dynamics models are designed to mimic the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a nonlinear fashion, and are broadly used for long-term forecasting and evaluating the effect of prevention measures (10) . However, many parameters associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission are poorly understood, including the incubation period, resulting in a biased prediction (11) . Multiple studies have explored the incubation period for COVID-19, but conclusions remain controversial due to limited sample sizes for each study and considerable heterogeneity between studies (12, 13) .",

Notably, a significant positive association between length of incubation period and magnitude of R 0 was observed. This finding indicates viral respiratory infections beyond SARS-CoV-2 may have transmission potential during their incubation period. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has a high dispersion of incubation period, which increases the difficulty in tracing and controlling for contacts. These unique epidemiologic characteristics partially contribute to today's global spread of COVID-19. The 14-day quarantine period has been adopted in mainland China and suggested to the international community by WHO (26) . We estimated that 7 out of 100 general infections would develop symptoms after 14 days. Further, nearly 15 out of 100 infected people under age 20 years will develop symptoms after 14 days. However, considering the probability of being infected among contacts of the population in active monitoring or quarantine, about 20 per 10 000 contacts would develop symptoms after 14 days in active monitoring or quarantine; the risk of observing young-age infections or asymptomatic transmissions developing symptoms after 14 days is below 1 in 10 000. Assuming the risks of being infected for the active monitoring population having contacts with symptomatic infections and latent infections were 1% in equal, about 3 in 10 000 contacts would develop symptoms after 14 days, which is more than 1.0 in 10 000 reported in the previous study. 19 Thus, the 14-day quarantine policy is sufficient to trace and identify infections among an active monitoring population. However, precise understanding of the crucial epidemiological parameters related to transmission probability in active monitoring population could aid in further refining the appropriate length of quarantine (27) .",

Due to considerable heterogeneity among studies (I 2 = 96.1%, P < 0.0001), random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the median incubation period to be 5.8 days (95%CI, 5.3-6.2 d) (Figure 2); the corresponding mean incubation period was 6.9 d. Notably, incubation period of general transmissions was shorter than that of asymptomatic transmissions (median, 7.7; 95%CI, 6.3-9.4 d, P = 0.0408) and that of young-ageinfections (median, 7.3 d; 95%CI 6.2-8.6 d, P = 0.0219) (Figure 3A, Supplement Figure 3). In addition, summarized results for preprint studies without peer-review (median, 6.4 d; 95%CI, 5.8-7.0 d) showed almost one-day longer of median incubation period than that among studies published in scientific journals (median, 5.4 d; 95%CI, 4.8-6.0 d; P = 0.0489) (Figure 3B, Supplement Figure 4). No difference was observed among studies in mainland China versus those performed in regions other than mainland China (P = 0.6075) (Figure 3C, Supplement Figure 5). Additionally, rather than solely focusing on the median, the dispersion of the incubation period was studied. Dispersions were estimated as 1.80 (95%CI, 1.59-2.06) for general transmissions, 1.37 (95%CI, 1.24-1.63) for asymptomatic transmissions, and 1.90 (95%CI, 1.55-2.61) for young-age infections, respectively.",

In addition, 2.9% (95%CI, 0.0-13.0%) and 0.1% (95%CI, 0.0-2.2%) of asymptomatic transmissions had an incubation period over 14 d and 21 d, respectively (Figure 4C).

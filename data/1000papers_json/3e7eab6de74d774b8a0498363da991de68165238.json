The possible biological and behavioral factors underlying this difference have recently been analyzed by Capuano et al. (1). The ideas raised by the authors define a clear need for a more adequate approach to sex differences in case fatality rate. The higher mortality rate in men has indeed been described extensively in literature (2-4). However, the impact of the current pandemic reaches far beyond mortality rates. To tackle this pandemic effectively, an integrated response is essential (5). That is why in this article, we would like to draw attention to some of the main structural, psychological, social and economic impacts this pandemic has on women, as observed by academics, practitioners and international organizations.",

The additional care burden associated with childcare and homeschooling during lockdowns and the care for sick family members can lead to considerable health impacts including e.g., psychological stress. Usual coping mechanisms are limited, given the reduced contact with peers and the disruption of supportive networks. This especially hits single-parent households, of which the majority are headed by women (21% of households with children in the United States compared to 4% by men) (15) . Furthermore, as a result, having less time for education, paid work, and career advancement, women can experience increased social inequality during this pandemic (15, 16) . Stay-at-home measures together with financial and security concerns can put considerable strain on families, which in some situations can lead to domestic abuse and sexual violence. UN-reports show that violence against women and girls has increased by 25% in several countries and even doubled in some countries since the outbreak of COVID-19 (17) .",

First of all, the manufacturing-and-retail industry has experienced large fallbacks in export and sales because of lockdown and distancing measures. The World Trade Organization (WTO) reports that female employees represent 80% of the workforce in ready-made garment production in Bangladesh, in which industry orders declined by 81% in April alone (20) . Moreover, a larger share of women than men work in tourism and business travel which are highly disrupted by travel restrictions and will require a long recovery period (16, 18) . Relying on faceto-face interactions, these occupations do not lend themselves to teleworking. Finally, this economic downturn will also be felt by female start-up entrepreneurs who are increasingly finding their way to micro, small and medium enterprises ",

Human rights reflect the minimum standards necessary for people to live with dignity. While the COVID-19 crisis is fast becoming a socio-economic crisis it adds pressure on human rights. For women and girls, the problems identified form an undeniable increased threat to their right to life and right to health (23) . Various international law instruments [e.g., The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Art. 25 (24) ] recognize the right to health as an inclusive right, encompassing a wide range of factors that help humans lead a healthy life (25) . These factors include safe drinking water, safe food, sanitation, but also health-related education and information, the right to access to health care, and gender equality. As the UN state in their latest Policy Brief, the economic impact and prevalence of poverty among women, their experience of violence, their position in society, the limited power many women have over their sexual and reproductive lives, and their lack of influence in decisionmaking are social realities that adversely impact women's human rights and that should move to global action (9).",

The current pandemic painfully highlights that gender inequality is still insufficiently addressed in our society. Public health should never be a predominantly men affair mainly focusing on the male body-a one-man show. In contrast, more gender-sensitive approaches that take into account different physical, mental, and social needs across the full gender spectrum are indispensable to guarantee optimal well-being of all.",

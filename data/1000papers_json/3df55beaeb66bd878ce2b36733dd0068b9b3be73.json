This is undesirable, especially for highly multivariate settings, where popular cross-covariance functions such as the multivariate Mat\u00e9rn suffer from a \"curse of dimensionality\" as the number of parameters and floating point operations scale up in quadratic and cubic order, respectively, in the number of variables. We propose a class of multivariate \"graphical Gaussian Processes\" using a general construction called \"stitching\" that crafts cross-covariance functions from graphs and ensure process-level conditional independence among variables. For the Mat\u00e9rn family of functions, stitching yields a multivariate GP whose univariate components are exactly Mat\u00e9rn GPs, and conforms to process-level conditional independence as specified by the graphical model. For highly multivariate settings and decomposable graphical models, stitching offers massive computational gains and parameter dimension reduction. We demonstrate the utility of the graphical Mat\u00e9rn GP to jointly model highly multivariate spatial data using simulation examples and an application to air-pollution modelling.",

However, all current multivariate Mat\u00e9rn models require estimating O(q 2 ) cross-covariance parameters and the multivariate Gaussian likeli-hood involves the inverse and determinant of the dense nq \u00d7 nq covariance matrix, which is prohibitive if n or q is large. Indeed, illustrations of multivariate Mat\u00e9rn have mostly restricted to applications with q \u2264 5. Our work is also related to a conditional approach developed in Cressie and Zammit-Mangion (2016) , where the univariate GPs are specified sequentially, conditional on the previous GPs assuming some ordering of the q variables. However, this approach requires an ordering of the q variables, and does not attempt to retain conditional dependence relations from an inter-variable graph over a continuous domain, which we seek here.",

            "text": "We address the highly-multivariate setting with tens to hundreds of variables measured at each spatial location, which is becoming increasingly commonplace in the environmental and physical sciences. We specifically address some key properties of multivariate GPs that are deemed critical for handling highly multivariate data. First, we retain the flexibility to model and interpret spatial properties of each surface separately. Except for the multivariate Mat\u00e9rn, most other multivariate covariance functions fail to retain this property. Next, we construct the highly multivariate model by adapting graphical models to process-based settings. While graphical models are extensively used to model multivariate dependencies in non-spatial settings, their use in spatial process modeling has primarily been to achieving scalability with respect to the number of locations (n). Multivariate covariance functions do not, in general, exploit an inter-variable graph to build a multivariate GP that conforms to process-level conditional independence among the variables. We introduce a method of stitching GPs together such that: (i) the marginal GP for each outcome agrees with the original process; and (ii) we retain the conditional independence of the processes implied by the inter-variable graph. Third, we focus on computational scalability with respect to the number of variables q. While substantial attention has been accorded to settings with massive number of locations (n) (see Heaton et al., 2019 , for a very recent review), the highly multivariate setting with large q fosters rather different computational issues. Likelihoods for popular covariance functions like the multivariate Mat\u00e9rn involve an O(q 2 ) parameter set, and O(q 3 ) computations. Hence, even for a small number of locations n, most methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality stemming from optimizing in or sampling from such a high-dimensional space.",

If some n i 's are large, one can use one of the many well-established variants for scaling up GPs to very large number of locations(Heaton et al., 2019). For example, a nearest neighbour GP (NNGP,Datta et al., 2016) yields a sparse approximation of C ii | L (D i , D i ) with linear complexity, but the joint distribution still preserves the conditional independence implied by G V .Turning to the highly multivariate case, where q is large, note that {w i (D i ) | w(L), i = 1, . . . , q} in (5) has q conditionally independent factors and is easy to compute. Hence, it is w(L) \u223c N (0, M (L, L)) that presents the bottleneck. In particular, there are two challenges for large q. As discussed earlier, the multivariate Mat\u00e9rn C(h) required for stitching needs toconstrain B = (b ij ) to be p.d. matrix on an O(q 2 )-dimensional parameter space. Searching in such a high-dimensional space is difficult for large q and verifying positive definiteness of B incurs an additional cost of O(q 3 ) floating point operations. Second, evaluating w(L) \u223c N (0, M (L, L)) involves matrix operations for the nq\u00d7nq matrix M (L, L). While the precision matrix, M (L, L) \u22121 , is sparse because of G V , its determinant is usually not available in closed form and the calculation can become prohibitive even for small n.",

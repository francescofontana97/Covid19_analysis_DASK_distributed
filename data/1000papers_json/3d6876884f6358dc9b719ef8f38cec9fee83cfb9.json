We first use valence_intensity_score as the first-line criterion as this dimension that has very high accuracy, i.e., 0.816 in terms of Pearson correlation with human annotated ground truth values. We then use the relative intensity comparing the three primary negative emotions, anger, fear and sadness to assign a corresponding dominant emotion category. The following script describes the conversion logic: // # Initialize the sentiment category in a \"no specific emotion\" class 1 emotion_category = \"no specific emotion\"; // # Assign the emotion category when valence intensity score exceeds 0.52 2 if(valence_intensity_score > 0.52): 3 emotion_category = \"joy or other positive expression\"; // # Assign the emotion category when valence intensity score falls below 0.48 4 elif(valence_intensity_score < 0.48): 5 emotion_category = \"anger\"; 6 if((fear_intensity_score > anger_intensity_score) and (fear_intensity_score > = sadness_intensity_score )): 7 emotion_category = \"fear\"; 8 elif((sadness_intensity_score > anger_intensity_score) and sadness_intensity_score > fear_intensity_score)): 9 emotion_category = \"sadness\"; Therefore, each tweet has an additional emotion_category attribute, indicating the dominant emotion as detected in the tweet.

Tetherin 4 is a dimeric dual-anchor type II membrane protein that contains one protein anchor, a transmembrane 5 domain near its N-terminus, an extracellular coiled-coil domain, and a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) 6 lipid anchor, which is attached to its C-terminus as a post-translational modification (37) (38) (39) . Tetherin 7 contains a number of conserved cytosine and asparagine motifs within the extracellular domain, with 8 respective roles in dimerisation and glycosylation, and a dual-tyrosine motif (Y\u00b7x\u00b7Y) in its cytoplasmic 9 region, which has a role in viral particle endocytosis and immune signalling cascades (31, 40) . Tetherin 10 is located in lipid rafts at the plasma membrane where many viral particles bud during acquisition of 11 their host membrane-derived viral envelopes (39) . During the viral budding process one anchor 12 remains embedded in the nascent viral envelope while the other remains attached to the plasma 13 membrane, tethering the virion to the cell and preventing its release into the extracellular 14 environment (28, 38) . 15 Tetherin is common to all mammals, and orthologs which share structural and functional, but not 16 sequence similarity, exist in other vertebrates (29) . Most mammals carry only a single tetherin gene; 17 however gene duplication has been observed in sheep, cattle, opossums and wallabies (29, 41) . 18 Furthermore, human tetherin is expressed in two alternative isoforms (30) , the long (l-tetherin) and 19",

The analysis revealed that overall, bat tetherin genes have been subjected to positive 9 selection, with an average ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) mutations, dN/dS, of 10 1.125 over the Chiropteran phylogeny, with numerous specific positions subjected to a large degree 11 of positive selection, with dN/dS values of 2.626 -2.668 (Table 2 ). These sites are predominantly 12 located in the transmembrane domain and the regions of the cytoplasmic and extracellular domains 13 immediately adjacent to the transmembrane domain ( Figure 1A ). This analysis suggests the presence 14 of evolutionary pressure exerted on tetherin, by viral antagonists or countermeasures that target 15 residues within tetherin, following the speciation of the Chiropteran order. The apparent ubiquity of 16 tetherin among bats, in concert with significant sequence diversity and evidence of strong positive 17 selection pressures operating on each species, supports the notion that tetherin plays a major role in 18 the antiviral repertoire of bats . 19 Fruit bats possess unique structural isoforms of the tetherin protein generated 20 through alternative splicing of a single tetherin gene 21 The expression of the fruit bat tetherin gene was initially assessed by a BLASTn search within the 22 transcriptome of an Australian fruit bat, the Black flying fox, Pteropus alecto, using the human tetherin 23 amino acid sequence as the search query. We identified 30 contigs matching the query (lowest E-value 24 = 9.21 x 10 -23 ). A single P. alecto homolog of tetherin, herein described as isoform A, homologous to 25 human l-tetherin and the predicted X1 isoform (GenBank: XM_006904279), was identified. P. alecto 26 tetherin isoform A has low primary amino acid sequence conservation (37%) compared to human l-27 tetherin ( Figure 2A ) and other mammalian (28 -47%) tetherin sequences homologous to human l-28 tetherin ( Figure 2B ). Despite the low amino acid sequence identity, the predicted secondary structures 29 and protein domains are largely conserved between bats and other mammals ( Figure 2B ). All tetherin 30 proteins containing the cytoplasmic (CD), transmembrane (TM), extracellular domains (ED), and the To verify the expression of bat tetherin isoform A, a cDNA library was prepared from P. alecto spleen 3 tissue, comprising several immune cell types, and assessed for the presence of transcripts matching 4 that identified in the P. alecto transcriptome.

This observation is significant because mutational studies of human tetherin have 14 demonstrated that the dual tyrosines provide redundancy for both the endocytic and signalling 15 activities, which are maintained as long as either tyrosine is present (31, 40) . 16 To understand the evolutionary selective pressures on tetherin genes across bat species, a selection 17 test was performed that revealed that bat tetherin genes are under strong positive selection with 18 amino acid positions in and around the transmembrane domain being the region under the strongest 19 selective pressure (Table 2 and Figure 1A ). This is in agreement with previous reports that primate 20 tetherin possess multiple sites under positive selection in this same region (28) . The driver of positive 21 selection in the case of primate tetherin is antagonism by viral counter-measures including HIV-1 Vpu 22 (59) . Venkatesh et al. (60) demonstrated that the configuration that tetherin dimers adopt during 23 viral particle retention primarily consists of the GPI-anchor being embedded in the viral envelope and 24 the transmembrane domain remaining attached to the cellular membrane. If this paradigm holds true 25 for bat tetherin, then it follows that the tetherin-cell membrane interface is the major site of tetherin 26 antagonism in bats and it would be reasonable to speculate that the drivers of this selection are viral 27",

This is important because 4 studies of human tetherin have demonstrated that the presence of a GPI-anchor is essential for 5 restricting the release of viral particles (28, 42) . Sheep and cows possess a duplication of the tetherin 6 gene (41, 51) . In sheep, the duplicate tetherin, named tetherin B, similarly does not encode a GSP, and 7 studies of sheep tetherin B function reveal that while it is capable of limited restriction of VLPs, it is 8 significantly less potent than sheep tetherin A (51) . The mechanism of its function is unknown and its 9 C-terminal amino acid sequence is entirely dissimilar from that of P. alecto tetherin isoform C. One Tetherin was expressed widely and variably across the tissues of P. alecto, which is consistent with 29 previous observations of human tetherin (36) . We observed the highest levels of P. alecto tetherin 30 expression in the thymus, possibly reflecting the role of the thymus in expressing a large proportion 31 of the proteome due to its role in central tolerance. High levels of expression were also observed in 32 lung tissue, particularly in the lung of an individual female bat. This may reflect a frontline defensive Tetherin was upregulated in spleen tissue treated with TLR agonists LPS and PIC. Interestingly, we 1 observed that the expression of isoforms A, B, and C was highly variable among individual spleen 2 samples. In several spleens, only isoform B was expressed, while in one spleen treated with PIC the 3 vast majority of expression was attributed to isoform A. The remainder expressed variable levels of 4 each isoform A and B, with the majority of expression trending toward isoform B. Surprisingly, isoform 5 C was only expressed, at a low level, in a single spleen sample that had been treated with PIC. The 6 biological importance of this observation is not presently known. Ongoing assessments of bat tetherin 7 expression should determine if this strong bias in alternative isoform expression is present in other 8 tissues, such as the thymus and lung. 9",

In contrast to restriction of 14 HIV-1, tetherin dimerisation is not required for the restriction of arenaviruses and filoviruses (61), 15 suggesting that the need for dimerisation is virus-dependent. 16 The P. alecto tetherin isoforms A and B, and M. macropus tetherin A, that were most similar to human 17 l-tetherin, were all found to predominantly form dimers. This was determined by non-reducing SDS-18 PAGE and Western blot analysis where bands were observed almost exclusively at the expected size 19 of tetherin dimers ( Figure 10 ). In contrast, P. alecto tetherin isoform C was present as both dimeric 20 and monomeric forms ( Figure 10A ). The presence of monomeric forms is surprising because P. alecto 21 tetherin isoform C contains all of the conserved cysteine residues and the same extracellular coiled-22 coil domain as isoforms A and B. The distinct C-terminal region in isoform C is the result of an 23 alternative splicing event that also causes the loss of the final three amino acid residues of the coiled-24 coil region possessed by isoforms A and B. Additionally, the inserted HA tag is located in the position 25 immediately following the coiled-coil domain. It is possible that the absence of the three terminal 26 amino acid residues in the coiled-coil domain of isoform C relative to isoform A and B accounts for the 27 difference in relative extents of dimerisation. Alternatively, the observed extent of dimerisation of 28 isoform C may be an artefact of the method used to process the samples for analysis and may not be 29 reflective of the extent of dimerisation in situ. It is also important to note that we cannot currently 30 rule out the possibility that the insertion of the HA tag in between the coiled-coil domain and the 31 alternative C-terminal sequence might be responsible for the observed reduction in dimerisation. M. 32 macropus tetherin B was observed exclusively as a monomer ( Figure 10B ).

The female bat had higher expression in the lung compared to in vesper bats, have demonstrated that tetherin is upregulated in response to type I 4 interferon alpha stimulation (18). To determine if pathogen-mediated stimulation can upregulate 5 tetherin expression in fruit bats we analysed the transcriptome of P. alecto spleen tissue from animals 6 treated in vivo with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or 7 polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC). In P. alecto, LPS treatment increases the percentage of B-cells in 8 the spleen (46), and PIC treatment was observed to increase the expression of the interferon-9 stimulated gene, ISG54 (47). We found that P. alecto tetherin was significantly upregulated by LPS (assessed if there was a difference in the expression of the alternative tetherin isoforms A, B 12 and C. This analysis revealed that tetherin is predominantly expressed as isoform B (14/15 samples; 9B) while stimulation with LPS significantly increased the expression of Isoform A (P = 14 0.048), but not Isoform B or C. Stimulation with PIC increased the expression of isoform A and B 15 compared to unstimulated tissue; however this effect was variable among individual bat spleen 16 samples and did not reach significance. Expression of Isoform C was only observed in a single PIC 17 treated spleen sample. These data show that tetherin isoforms are expressed in tissue and can be 18 upregulated by stimulation with TLR-agonists. 19 P. alecto tetherin protein expression and cellular localisation 20 To characterise bat tetherin, we analysed tetherin from two Australian bats, the fruit bat P. alecto and 21 the vesper bat M. macropus. The coding sequences of the P. alecto tetherin isoforms A, B, and C, and 22 M. macropus tetherin A and B, were cloned into mammalian expression plasmids. While numerous 23 vesper bat tetherins were identified in this study, M. macropus tetherin A and tetherin B were selected 24for further analysis as tetherin A is a homolog of human l-tetherin and tetherin B was the most 25 structurally unique, possessing a large deletion within the extracellular coiled-coil domain compared 26 to tetherin A (Figure 4B).27",

For all VLPs, the secondary antibody was a 1/10,000 diluted 28 polyclonal goat anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 680 fluorophore-conjugate fluorescent secondary antibody 29 (Thermo Fisher). 30 VLPs released into the supernatant for each sample were quantified using a densitometric analysis of 1 the signal strength of the fluorescent antibodies bound to VLP proteins. Densitometry was performed 2 using the Image Studio Lite v5.2 software suite (LI-COR). Variation in viral lysate signal strength across 3 samples was normalised using the signal strength of the cell lysates. The non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank 4Sum test was performed to calculate the statistical significance of the restriction of Ebola and underlying this article are available in this article and its online supplementary material.

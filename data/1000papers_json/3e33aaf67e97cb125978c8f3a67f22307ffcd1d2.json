Within the vacuoles seen in muscle fibers from patients with IBM proteins characteristic for DAT, such as phosphorylated tau, are found. It has recently been shown that intracellular beta-amyloid peptide induces apoptosis in muscle fibers. Accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide in brain tissue is the crucial biochemical finding in DAT.

S. Ravaglia, D. Franciotta, P. Tosca, E. Zardini, P. Chimento, P. Bini and A. Moglia Institute of Neurology, C. Mondino, University of Pavia, Italy Different types of dementias share common profiles as regards risk factors, clinical-imaging characteristics, pathophysiological and neurochemical mechanisms. These overlapping features raise the need for a biological marker aimed at supporting the known lack of specificity of clinical diagnosis alone. We aimed this study at evaluating the usefulness of the virtually specific CSF fosfo-TAU in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and as a marker of disease progression. We evaluated 40 patients with either AD (50%), vascular (VaD) (19%) and mixed dementia (31%). The groups had homogeneous mean age, degree of cognitive impairment and disease duration; these parameters were not related to fosfo-Tau levels. We found no significant difference in mean fosfo-Tau between AD and vascular-mixed dementia (P = 0.064). Conversely, higher p-Tau values seemed to predict, independent of the clinical diagnosis, a more rapid evolution of cognitive decline (P = 0.002) as assessed by the rate of decrease in mini mental state examination score on a 10 month follow-up. The lack of correlation between fosfo-Tau levels and parameters of disease severity implies the potential usefulness of this marker even in early stage of disease. Fosfo-Tau levels fail to distinguish between AD and mixed dementia: whether this finding may simply reflect the unsatisfactory clinical criteria for the vascular group remains to be defined. Fosfo-Tau may indeed serve as a prognostic marker of disease evolution; if confirmed, this statement may indicate the availability of a novel tool for predicting cognitive decline and effectiveness of any therapeutic approaches, thus shifting the concept of a static marker to a dynamic one. previously been conducted in Thai patients.

Methods: A 6 month multicenter, open-label trial was conducted in Thailand. Patients with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease with or without cerbrovaccular disease and possible vascular dementia were received galantamine with a slow -titration regimen (up to 12 mg twice daily) for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy assessments were the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale -Cognitive subscale. Tolerability and safety was evaluated on the basis of adverse event report, physical examination and laboratory parameters. Results: 72 patients were enrolled. The most common adverse events were mild to moderate nausea and vomiting (25% and 14% respectively). This happened in the titration period and decreased in frequency during stabilized period.

Short-and long-term safety and tolerability of memantine for dementia treatment were assessed through five double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and five open-label extension studies. Short-term safety of memantine in moderate to severe AD patients (n = 734; memantine 10-20 mg/ day; 12-28 weeks) was assessed in three of five double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Two other double-blind trials examined 900 mild to moderate vascular dementia (VaD) patients administered 20 mg/day memantine or placebo for 28 weeks. Long-term safety of memantine was assessed by pooling data from five open-label extension studies with moderate to severe AD and VaD patients. Safety parameters included adverse events (AEs), vital signs and clinical laboratory tests. In the evaluation of short-term safety, only headache and confusion were reported in =5% of moderate to severe memantine-treated AD patients at an incidence of at least twice that of placebo. Only constipation was reported in =5% of memantine-treated VaD patients at an incidence of at least twice that of placebo. The overall profile of AEs reported in the long-term, open-label studies was similar to that reported in the short-term, double-blind studies. Most AEs reported in all studies were considered mild or moderate in severity and not related to memantine. No clinically relevant differences between memantine and placebo patients in vital signs or laboratory values were observed. Short-and long-term treatment of dementia with memantine is safe and well tolerated. Distribution of dementias was as follows: In 2001 Alzheimer's disease (AD) was diagnosed in majority cases of demented patients and amounted to 89% of all dementias, vascular dementia (VD) -4%, other forms of dementia were diagnosed in 7% of all cases. In 2002 the proportions were -71% AD, 12% VD and 17% and in 2003 -71% AD, 8% VD and 21% respectively. In the beginning of dementia diagnosis the majority of patients were older than 65 years of age and predominantly female. Conclusion: Our data show that prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in distribution of dementias is similar to other countries. Dementia was diagnosed in its middle stages for the patients older than 65 years. both in neuropathological and clinical aspects. This may suggest a similar overlap in physiopathology, namely an involvement of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in FTD, as it has been associated to AD. In order to determine if mtDNA is involved in FTD, we performed a Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis, specific to mtDNA NADH Dehydrogenase subunit 1 nucleotides 3337-3340, searching for mutations previously described in Parkinson's and AD patients. We could identify one FTD patient with two mtDNA transitions: one already known (3316 G-to-A) and another unreported (3337 G-to-A).

Expression profiles of 1176 known genes representing different functional classes in untreated and 5 mM butyrate-treated rat VSMCs are compared. The comparison resulted in the identification of 141 differentially expressed genes amounting to 12% of the genes on the array. Of these genes, 111 genes exhibit moderate (>2.0 to 5.0-fold) to strong (>5.0-fold) differential expression. Among these differentially expressed genes, 43 genes are implicated in cell growth and differentiation. Butyrate-inhibited VSMC proliferation involves downregulation of genes that encode several positive regulators of cell growth and up-regulation of several negative regulators of cell growth or differentiation-inducers. Some of the downregulated genes include PCNA, cdk1, cdc2, cyclin B1, p130RB, p55CDC, NF-kB, HMGI, and HMG2, whereas upregulated genes include p21WAF, p14INK4B/P15INK5B, Clusterin, inhibitor of DNA-binding protein 1 and 2, I-kB, and jun-D.

Refractory patients to medical treatment were qualified for more aggressive treatment such as angioplasty. A total of 102 patients with a mean age of 63.3 \u00b1 10.4 years were enrolled. The stenoses involved the following arteries: vertebral artery (26 patients), basilar artery (27 patients), middle cerebral artery (27 patients), and internal carotid artery (26 patients). During the follow-up 43.1% of the patients experienced a TIA or a stroke (17.6%) within a mean follow-up of 23.9 months. Non-cerebrovascular events were coronary artery disease (13.7%) and lower limb arteritis (2.9%), and the vascular mortality rate was 8.8%.

Background: Patients who experienced a stroke due to a patent foramen ovale (PFO) are at risk of suffering from recurrent paradoxical embolism. Seven hundred patients were referred to us to have their PFO closed percutaneously. This is the largest patient series worldwide. Patients: The age 17-82 years (mean 49 \u00b1 13). A total of 257 patients had an atrial septal aneurysm in addition to their PFO. The annual recurrence rate of embolic events after the first event and before PFO closure was 26.1%.

Length of hospital stay varied from 4.5 h to 7.9 days (23h \u00b1 19h). The following complications occurred: 28 patients developed transient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, in 13 patients a thrombus was detected on the occluder, 12 of whom remained asymptomatic (one embolism). For different reasons five patients underwent surgery: thrombus (2), hemopericardium (2), and sepsis (1) . Five patients died during follow-up: pneumonia (2), hemopericardium (1), sepsis (1), and massive cerebral bleeding (1) .

Several reports indicated glycaemia over 7.0 mmol/l within the first 12 h of stroke is closely associated with infarct expansion and bad prognosis. However effect of maintenance of glycaemia <7.0 mmol/l with insulin in non-diabetic patients and safety of such intervention is not well established. The aim of present study was to determine the effect of such strict glycaemia control in acute stroke patients. Methods: In a prospective, randomized, open study, 50 nondiabetic patients with a non-hemorrhagic infarction within 12 h after onset with mild hyperglycaemia (<11 mmol/l) are randomly assigned to receive either a 24 h insulin infusion to maintain glycaemia <7.0 mmol/l or standard therapy (subcutaneous insulin to keep glucose <10 mmol/l or no treatment).

Wang, F. Le Doze, J. P. Muresan and G. L. Defer Service de Neurologie Dejerine, CHU Co\u02c6te de Nacre, Caen, France Introduction: Cerebrovascular disease may complicate systemic cancer. In a few cases, this cancer is unknown and revealed by the cerebrovascular event. We describe two cases of carcinoma revealed by ischaemic stroke due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIVC). Case reports: Two patients, a 56-year-old man and a 44-yearold woman, were admitted with right hemiplegia caused by a left mild cerebral artery territory infarct. Cervical Doppler ultrasound, ECG, and transoesophageal echocardiography were normal whereas blood tests showed DICV in both cases: low fibrinogen in one case, low platelet count, elevated prothrombin, assay for fibrin degradation products and positive test for soluble complexes were found in both cases. In the first case, chest roentgenography disclosed atelectasia in the right upper lobe and adenocarcinoma of the lung was revealed by bronchial biopsy. In the second case, medical investigations showed multiple lymph nodes and metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin were revealed by cervical lymph node biopsy. Chemotherapy was performed only in the second case but both patients died after 2 months. Discussion: DIVC is one of the most common aetiology for cerebrovascular complications of cancer. DIVC may cause diffuse encephalopathy rather than focalized ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. However, cerebral infarcts due to DIVC may lead to the discovery of cancer before any other clinical features, especially for ovarian cancer and acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Once DIVC is diagnosed in patients with stroke, investigations should look for cancer as a few reported patients had a favourable prognosis after its treatment. Background: Autoimmune and blood rheological properties disturbances involved in ischemic brain damage may be connected with circulation of cryoglobulines (CG), pathological immunnoglobulines. Purpose: The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether crioglobulinemia contributes to disturbances of blood rheological properties and to estimate the influence of CG on current acute ischemic stroke (IS). Methods: The study included 58 patients with acute IS due to occlusive atherothrombosis and cardiac embolism. The level of CG was detected by spectrophotometry in blood serum on days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 21. Neurological status was assessed with the Orgogozo and NIH Stroke Scales (SS); functional outcome was assessed with the Barthel Index (BI). Blood rheology was assessed by Born-O-Brian technique. Results: Increased level of CG showed positive correlation with stroke severity by the Orgogozo SS (r = 0.6; P < 0.01) on day 1, platelet aggregation (r = 0.46; P < 0.05), and blood viscosity (r = 0.74; P < 0.01). High CG level in dynamics correlated with the Orgogozo and NIH SS on day 7 (r = -0.54, P < 0.05 and r = 0.65, P < 0.05, correspondingly), especially in atherothrombosis (P < 0.05 versus cardiac embolism). The retrospective analysis has shown negative correlation of the BI with the high CG level on day 21 (r = -0.7; P < 0.05). Conclusion: The phenomenon of cryoglobulinemia revealed in acute IS correlated with clinical severity and blood rheological disorders degree, and influenced IS outcome.

Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted in two centers. 77 patients with confirmed ICAD and 77 ageand sex-matched subjects with abnormal ultrasonographic examination were compared for early (first 4 days) clinical and ultrasonographic data. Results: The mean age was 46.3 \u00b1 10.2. In ICAD patients 84.3% had stroke and 13.6% TIA. In 80.5% of ICAD patients interrogatory revealed acute headache preceding for 3.46 days (SD 3.6 median 2) the clinical onset, since in controls 71% had stroke and 21% had acute headache preceding or opening the neurological event. Horner sign and pulsate tinnitus were infrequent in ICAD population and absent in controls. The duplex color-coded ultrasonographic (DCUS) examination was performed 1.85 \u00b1 1.24 days after the clinical onset. The mean delay to obtain a confirming exploration (MRI or angiography) was 18 days, but 29% of recanalizations occurred before day 19.

Echographic signs like tapering, outlying, anechogeneous, homogeneous postbulbar stenosis or occlusion was frequent and highly specific for ICAD (all P < 0,001), while intimal flap and doublechannel were infrequent. Conclusions: DCUS examination performed early in clinically suspected ICAD could be an important diagnostic tool.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the causes and risk factors for ischemic stroke in young patients of Serbia during the previous 15 years. Methods: A total of 743 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke, aged 15-45 years, were managed by the pre-designed protocol for young ischemic stroke patients. Etiologic diagnostic tests were performed on case-by-case basis and according to their availability at the time. All the causes were classified according to the TOAST criteria. Results: There were 426 men and 317 women, with 18.3% of patients <30 years and 11% with TIA. Large-artery atherosclerosis was confirmed in 11.3%, small-artery occlusion in 13.1%, embolism in 18.2% and other determined causes in 16.4% of patients. Undetermined causes made up 40% of patients, mostly those (34%) with inadequate investigations. Hypertension (35%), smoking (34.9%), and hyperlipidemia (32.8%) were the most common risk factors. Rheumatic heart diseases and prosthetic valves were the most common causes of ischemic stroke. Arterial dissections and coagulation inhibitors deficit were detected in a small number of patients.

We examined stroke severity on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and accordingly divided patients into three groups: with mild (NIHSS <8), moderate (NIHSS 8-16) and severe (NIHSS > 16) stroke. Disability after stroke was determined on the Barthel index (BI) at the hospital discharge and subsequently patients were divided into three groups: with severe (BI 0-59), moderate (BI 60-84), and mild (BI 85-100) disability. This study aimed at investigation of CSF levels of antiinflammatory cytokine Interleukin-10 in 48 h from ischemic stroke onset and at establishment of correlation of these data with ischemic lesion size and neurological dynamics during the first week of acute brain ischemia. Subjects and methods: 40 patients aged from 45 to 75, 26 females and 16 males, have been investigated. Initial and later neurological impairment was assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Patients were divided into two groups: 1st group (23 patients) with severe stroke (GCS < 14, NIHSS > 15) and 2nd group (17 patients) with relatively mild stroke (GCS = 14,15; NIHSS < 15). Control comprised 15 agematched patients with vertebral discopathies. Neurological deterioration was diagnosed when the NIHSS score increased or GOS score dropped at 1 point. Ischemic lesion size was evaluated on conventional MRI scans. Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 CSF levels were defined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Statistical evaluation was performed applying the SPSS program. Mean values were calculated by t-paired test. Pearson product-moment correlation and multivariate logistic regression have been used. Significant negative correlation was found between the IL-10 initial CSF levels, ischemic lesion size and NIHSS score at 1 week as well (r = -0.67, P < 0.01 and r = -0.54, P < 0.05, respectively).

CXCL5 and CXCL6 are potent neutrophil chemoattractants belonging to CXC chemokines family. The aim of the study was to investigate CXCL5 and CXCL6 levels in CSF of stroke patients and to evaluate them in relation to neurological stroke severity and its outcome. The investigation comprised 23 patients in whom CSF sampling was performed within 24 h of ischaemic stroke. CSF samples from 15 tension headache individuals served as a control group. CXCL5 and CXCL6 levels were determined by ELISA. Neurological stroke severity was estimated by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) scoring points calculated within 24 h of stroke (SSS-1) and at the second week later (SSS-2); median scores for SSS-1 and SSS-2 were 31 and 45, respectively; P < 0.001.

We investigated 32 male patients (mean age 62.0 years) with chronic cerebrovascular pathologies, who had frequent episodes of OSA during the night sleep.

The aims of the study were to analyze IS as the indicator of atherosclerotic activity, as well as plasma insulin levels (PI) in 30 patients with atherothrombotic IST confirmed on computerized tomography/ magnetic resonance imaging (group A), 30 patients with asymptomatic stenosis of one or both internal carotid arteries > 50% (group B), and 30 healthy controls (group C).

Methods: 67 subjects with acute ischemic stroke and 76 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. At the patient admission, the concentration of soluble adhesion molecules, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and total leukocyte count were determined. The concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules were determined using quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay. On the following morning, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-concentrations were determined in patient sera. Results: The mean levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and sE-selectin were higher, whereas sL-selectin was lower in patients with acute ischemic stroke than in controls. In patients, soluble adhesion molecule levels did not differ with respect to carotid atherosclerotic disease, smoking status, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Some soluble adhesion molecules correlated with blood glucose, lipid parameters, and the markers of inflammation. Conclusion: Acute ischemic stroke is associated with elevated plasma levels of inflammatory adhesion molecules independently of age, sex and other recognized stroke risk factors.

To determine cerebral venous reserve and possible anatomical predisposition to cerebral venous circulatory abnormality 21 patients with clinically manifested cerebral venous insufficiency and 16 healthy subjects were examined. Blood flow in major paired cerebral veins [ophthalmic (O), Rosenthal (R), vertebral (V), jugular vein (J), and athlanto-occipital sinus bilaterally (A)] was measured using transcranial Doppler in sitting position. Flow velocity and Gosling index (PI) in middle cerebral artery (MCA) were monitored during jugular occlusion test using neck pneumo-cuff. The test revealed three types of MCA flow reaction: 0-5% increase in PI was observed in 13 healthy subjects; >5% increase in PI with immediate post-release flow restoration -in three healthy subjects and in 17 patients; >5% increase in PI with delayed post-release flow restoration (suspected venous dystony) -in four patients. Factor analysis of pre-test velocities in O, R, V, A, J, and percentage of PI increase (%PI) showed that %PI was adjacent to R and J, but %PI was opposite to A, V, and O.

About 33% of strokes were associated with aphasia. Aim: We wanted to investigate the role of TCD in determination of cerebral vascular disease causing the post-stroke aphasia. Methods: Consecutive 200 patients with acute ischemic stroke and aphasia were received standard TCD examination with a MultiDop unit in the first 48 h of onset. In the 166 patients with interpretabile TCD findings extracranial carotid disease were determinated by Color Duplex sonography. There were no history and brain CT scan findings of the earlier stroke or the other neurological disease. Results: The TCD findings were: 11 patients (5.5%) with no blood flow in the left medial cerebral artery (L MCA) and three (1.5%) in the right (R MCA); eight (4%) with stenosis of the L MCA and three (1.5%) of the R MCA; 45 (22.5%) with hypoperfusion of the L MCA, 12 (6%) of the R MCA, and 19 (9.5%) with bilateral hypoperfusion. Thirty (15%) of the hypoperfusion patients had a significant stenosis of the extracranial carotid artery. Sixty-five patients (32.5%) were with no changes in the intracranial hemodynamics. Seventeen (8.5%) were with anterior, three (1.5%) with posterior, and two (1%) with both collateral circulations.

Louhab, M. Jafoui, K. Asbai, J. Hamdi and N. Kissani Department of Neurology, Ibn Tofail Hospital, Marrakech, Morocco Ischemic stroke is a rare event in young adults. We report this series in order to study the risk factors, etiology, and management of stroke in young adults in south Morocco, and to compare our data with national and international reports. A retrospective study conducted at the neurology department of Marrakech for 8 years (1996 to 2003) , including 57 patients, aged between 15 and 45 years admitted with a diagnostic of ischemic infarct. Patients were referred from general practitioners, neurosurgeons and very rarely from cardiologists. All patients underwent biological neuroimaging and echographical explorations. There were 33 females and 24 males (sex ratio = 1.4). The causes of ischemic stroke were identified in 24 of the 57 patients and included cardioembolism (58%), protein S or C deficiency (16%), syphilis arteritis (16%) and antiphospholipid syndrome (4 %). No cause was found in 33 patients. One patient died, the outcome was excellent in 30%, good in 55% and poor in 15% of patients. Authors underline that some causes remain underdiagnosed, due to low socioeconomical level and also because of the low rate of citizens having social security (30% in urban areas and less than six in rural). Our study found that cardioembolism was the most common cause of stroke in young adults. A small number of neurologists, socioeconomic low level, and patients not referred to neurologist explained the small number of cases. Introduction: Gait apraxia or frontal lobe ataxia is a gait disorder characterized by difficulty in walking without weakness, loss of sensation or cerebellar incoordination. Stroke affecting the frontal lobes and their connections with the basal ganglia constitute a cause of frontal lobe gait disorder. Case report: A 64-year-old woman developed, after an accidental fall, akinetic mutism that lasts 1 h. Twelve hours later presented with gait difficulties. On admission she was alert, oriented without any mental impairment; she was unable to initiate locomotion and assumed a posture of slight flexion of the legs; no other neurological signs were found. General physical examination was normal. Brain MRI showed two hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images on the left hemisphere: one in the lenticulo-capsular area and the other temporal subcortical. The serological studies including B12 vitamin, folates, and serologies to Treponema pallidum and HIV were normal or negative. The cervical and lumbar spine MRI, the transthoracic echocardiogram and ultrasound scanning were also normal. She started gait rehabilitation 6 days later. Two months later, she could walk initially with short steps, widened base and 'magnetic feet' but her gait became more normal as walking proceeded. Conclusions: Akinetic mutism and gait apraxia are a rarity and are usually associated with frontal lobes lesions and their connections with the basal ganglia. In this case the clinical manifestations are associated with infarcts involving lentiform nucleus and external capsule. These are infrequent, their features poorly documented and their association with these clinical manifestations not previously described in literature.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 497, "end": 511, "text": "(1996 to 2003)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2095"}, {"text": "Arteriovenous malformation of the brain, clinical neurological and neuroimaging studies in 10 years following-up after the treatment D.

Methods: In respect to progress of leukoaraiosis, 21 patients with leukoaraiosis and platelet hyper-aggregability whose platelet hyper-aggregability was not corrected was compared with another 21 similar-aged, grades of leukoaraiosis and observation period-matched patients whose platelet hyperaggregability was corrected. Platelet aggregability was estimated by an optical analytical method using two different concentrations each of ADP and collagen (the double ADP method). Three doctors, except the first author, with blind manner, evaluated the changes in leukoaraiosis. Results: The observation period of both groups was 4.1 years on average. In the non-corrected group, moderate to severe aggravation of leukoaraiosis was observed in a large number of patients, while in the corrected group, only a small number of patients showed aggravation of leukoaraiosis, and the aggravation was mild in most of these cases. That is, the number of patients showing aggravation of periventricular hyperintensity was 7 in 21 in the non-corrected group versus 1 in 21 (P = 0.022) in the corrected group, and for aggravation of deep white-matter hyperintensity, these numbers were nine in 21 versus four in 21, respectively.

A. Saria, 1 Object of study: The aim of this study was to investigate the level of aPTT as a marker of long-term outcome in stroke survivors. Methods: 86 patients with haemispheric (but not territorial) strokes and fifty-two patients with brainstem strokes were included. In the first group (hemispheric infarcts), half the patients underwent anticoagulation therapy with heparin infusion to aim the aPTT values twofold above the normal range, and the rest half of patients were treated with relatively low dose heparin and had aPTT within normal range. In the second group of patients with brainstem infarcts, half of them (26) were treated with high doses of haeparin, to aim aPTT value 2.5-fold above the normal range and rest half of patients had aPTT within normal range. Results: When compared the 6-month outcome within each group, it was found that the patients with hemispheric infarcts, who had higher level of aPTT)50-55 s, had better quality of life, and less (9%) post-stroke complications, than those who had aPTT within normal range during the treatment, and 22% of them had various post-stroke complications, mainly spasticity, and thus worse quality of life after 6 months of stroke. The same picture was observed in the second group, patients with brainstem infarcts, and high level of apt -80 s, had less (12%) frequency of complications, than those, who had aPTT within normal range (47% of them had some kind of mental deficiency and impaired mobility). Conclusions: The high level of aPTT during anticoagulation therapy is a useful factor to improve post-stroke outcome in stroke survivors. Background: Cerebral small vessel disease leading to small perforating arteries occlusion can cause both lacunar infarction and more confluent white matter lesions (WML). Different populations could differ in risk factors. The aim of our study was to determine risk factors profile in patients with ischemic white matter disease in our population. Methods: Forty-seven risk factors parameters were analyzed in 154 consecutive patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of ischemic WML. Patients were evaluated according to originally designed clinical protocol, in order to detect all risk factors and exclude other possible etiologies for white matter disease. Group consisted of 82 (53.2%) male and 72 (46.8%) female patients, with mean age of 62.2 \u00b1 11.3 years. Results: The most frequently encountered risk factor was arterial hypertension (in 126 or 81.8% of patients), with mean duration of 8.5 \u00b1 10.2 years. Mean systolic blood pressure was 177.0 \u00b1 36.9, while mean diastolic blood pressure was 105.5 \u00b1 20.6 mmHg. Only 81 (64.3%) hyper-tensive patients were treated.

Stroke major risk factors (hypertension, atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterinemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol intake) studied retrospectively. NIHSS and Ranking scale assessed initial and later neurological impairment. Conventional MRI (0.2 T) T2 images have been used to identify the ischemic regions. Revised criteria for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (American Diabetes Association Committee Report -1999) were applied. Capillary glucose levels were determined at admission, FPG on a subsequent day and OGTT with 2-h post-load value on the 4th and 7th days of stroke onset. Seventy-five grams of anhydrous glucose dissolved in water was used as a glucose load. Statistical evaluation performed by SPSS. Means were calculated by t-paired test. Multivariate logistic regression has been used when all risk factors of stroke were included in analysis. Results: Nineteen (30.6%) were diagnosed to have the impaired glucose homeostasis, among them four patients noticed to have their FPG > 126 mg/dl. All these patients were found to have violated glucose tolerance after OGTT (2-h PG = 206 \u00b1 4.8 mg/dl).

The study included 50 patients (29 men and 21 women) who had suffered ischemic stroke 3 weeks to 6 months before the study. The Crown-Crisp experience index including six scales: scales of anxiety, phobia, obsession, somatization, depression, and hysteria, was used for detection of emotional disturbances. Results showed a high prevalence of emotional disturbances in the study group. Depression was most common (72%), followed by generalized anxiety (58%), and phobic disturbances (66%). According to hemispheric lateralization of the cerebral lesion, a more intense emotional response was found in case of right hemisphere lesions, however, the difference was statistically significant only on the scale of obsession (P < 0.05). According to sex, a more intensive emotional response was recorded in women, the difference being statistically significant on the scales of anxiety (P < 0.05), depression (P < 0.05), and phobia (P < 0.01). According to the neurologic deficit severity, an increasing tendency in the prevalence of emotional disturbances was observed with the increasing severity of neurological deficit. Study results showed a high prevalence of emotional disturbances after stroke, suggesting a hypothesis on their combined etiology. Background and purpose: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is increasingly recognized in association with cryptogenic stroke. The capability of transcranial Doppler (TCD) to detect the PFO has been established. We evaluated the frequency of the PFO in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Methods: The study population consisted of 69 consecutive patients (49 men, mean age: 53.5). Patients underwent a TCD with the monitoring of bilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCA) and injection of air bubble. The injection was repeated during normal breathing and Valsalva maneuver. High intensity transient signals (HITS) were counted for 30 s after the end of the Valsalva maneuver. Results: HITS were counted in 12 (17%) ischemic stroke patients (10 men, mean age: 54). In 12 patients with positive HITS, 10 (83%) patients had less than 10 HITS (mean: 2.5); 2 (17%) patients, more than 10 HITS (mean: 10.5). In three patients under the age 45, all three patients had no other risk factors except positive PFO test. In nine patients above the age 45, two patients had no alternative cause of stroke. Conclusions: PFO is common in patients with ischemic stroke. TCD is a potential tool for detecting a PFO. Background: Our university hospital serves a population of 300 000 inhabitants. A stroke unit (SU) containing two beds in the intensive care unit and four beds in the department of Neurology, was created in June 2003. Objective: To study the changes of stroke patients care occurring since the creation of the SU. Methods: During 6 months in 2002 in the emergency department (ED), and during 6 months in 2003, since the creation of the SU, were prospectively recorded for suspected stroke patients: demographic data, mode of transport, time from the onset of symptoms (OS) to arrival, time to brain CT scanner, diagnosis, length of stay (LOS). Results: The 111 patients admitted in the SU were younger than the 324 patients admitted in the ED (68 years old vs. 76 years old, P < 0.001). Median delay from OS to arrival was lower for the SU patients (180 min vs. 310 min, P < 0.001). Median delay to CT scanner was reduced for the SU patients (100 min vs. 160 min, P < 0.001). In 6 months, nine patients were treated with intravenous thrombolysis in the first 3 h, fiber of them had a dramatic recovery at 24 h. Mean LOS in the stroke network was lower: 9 days vs. 14 days in 2002 (P < 0.001). In hospital fatality rate and proportion of patients discharged at home were similar.

A. Shchepankevich, 1 P. I. Pilipenko 1 and I. V. Pikalov 2 Departments of 1 Neurology and Neurosurgery; 2 Laboratory Diagnostic, Novosibirsk State Medical Academy, Russia Introduction: The ischemic stroke cases represent 80% of acute cerebrovascular accidents. There are different steps of platelet activation, blood coagulation, and fibrinolitic cascade in the pathomechanism of the brain infarcts. But it remains uncertain whether the system of hemostasis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is contributory to stroke severity. The main cause of the damage and fragmentation of the erythrocytes is the fibrin sediment in microvessels. After onset AIS the system of hemostasis was activated and erythrocytes passing through this microvessels have lost part of the membrane and excrete a phospholipid factor like a 3-platelet factor. We supposed the number of the injured red blood cells (RBC) became elevated during the AIS. Material and methods: To examine this issue, the number of the injured red blood cells was counted in the blood samples of 25 age-and sex-matched control group and 44 patients with acute ischemic stroke and sequential changes at 3 weeks following the onset of stroke. Results: Baseline number of RBC was significantly increased in the AIS patients compared with a control group (P = 0.029). Following admission, there were also significant increases in number of RBC at 3 weeks (P = 0.006). Using the Spearman's correlation analysis we found the association between number of RBC and stroke severity (National Institutes of Health -National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Scale; P = 0.025). Conclusions: We conclude that acute stroke patients have marked baseline intravascular activation of hemostasis system.

PCA and APC resistance was studied in 47 patients (22 female, 25 male) which were diagnosed as acute ischemic stroke. The mean age of the patients included in the study was found 66 \u00b1 16. In 10 patients the APCR was found to be abnormal according to the normal laboratory values. The protein C activity was found abnormal in 9 patients. The prognostical assesment showed that the Protein C activity was prominently higher in the patients who survived than the patient who had died (P = 0.017). The APCR levels were found higher in the patient group who had higher triglyceride levels (P = 0.041). Negative correlation was found between the protein C activity and fasting blood glucose level, CRP and fibrinogen.

Its pathogenesis and contributing factors are still not fully understood. The purpose: The aim of this work is investigation of relationship fatigue and cardiovascular disturbances. Patients and methods: We examined 20 patients (68.4% women, 31.6% men). The average age was 36.3 \u00b1 13.8, the average EDSS was 2.9 \u00b1 1.5, the average time of the illness was 6.6 \u00b1 5.3. The fatigue was estimated by two scales: Fatigue Descriptive Scale (FDS) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Disturbances of cardiovascular system was examined by a questionnaire (contained 12 questions concerned complaints connected with cardiovascular disturbances) and following laboratory tests: heart rate response during standing and deep breathing, blood pressure in supine and standing position, E:I ratio, 30:15 ratio. Results: Fatigue was found in 25% of patients. 35% of patients had fatigue and symptoms of cardiovascular disturbances (six or more positive questions in questionnaire). 42.1% of patients had fatigue-positive results of laboratory tests (abnormalities in at least five tests). There were no statistically significant correlations between fatigue, symptoms of cardiovascular disturbances and laboratory tests. Methods: Data have been obtained from the first 13 adult patients treated with i.v. VPA for benzodiazepine-resistant SE/SA. The protocol suggested a VPA loading dose of 25 mg/ kg over 30 min, followed by continuous infusion of 100 mg/h for 24 h. Results: Nine were diagnosed with SE, four with SA. Eight had generalized tonic-clonic while 5 had complex-partial seizures as their main SE/SA seizure type. Median VPA bolus dose was 2100 mg (range 200-2400). Median time from start of SE/SA for all patients was 1.5 h (range 0.3-72 h). For patients with complex partial SE/SA, median time to start of VPA was 12 h (range 1-72). Effect, defined as the lack of need of anaesthesia, showed that VPA was effective in 10 of 13 cases. Of the three cases requiring anaesthesia, two had a significant delay before starting treatment (8 and 72 h). Moderate hypotension during bolus dose infusion was seen in one patient, corrected with i.v. saline. Otherwise, no side-effects were reported. Conclusions: VPA seems to be safe and effective in the treatment of benzodiazepine-resistant SE/SA. Lack of effect may be related to delayed treatment.

Isobolographic analysis is a very convenient procedure for detecting synergy, additivity or antagonism for AEDs combinations. Five newer AEDs were included in this study -felbamate (FBM), lamotrigine (LTG), loreclezole (LCZ), oxcarbazepine (OXC), and topiramate (TPM). All possible combinations of two AEDs were considered and evaluated for their anticonvulsant activity against maximal electroshock test in mice (a model of generalized tonic-clonic and to a certain degree of partial seizures). Their neurotoxicity was assessed in the chimney test, evaluating motor coordination. TPM, in three fixed dose ratio combinations (3:1; 1:1; 1:3) with the remaining AEDs, exerted synergistic anticonvulsant effects, with apparent antagonism in the chimney test (at 1:1). Additivity in this test was evident for TPM + OXC (for all dose ratios) and for other AEDs combinations at ratios of 1:3 and 3:1. In contrast, antagonistic interactions in the maximal electroshock test were identified for OXC + LTG and OXC + FBM, with evident synergy displayed in the chimney test. All combinations not mentioned above displayed additivity in the maximal electroshock test in mice. The experimental data clearly indicate that among combinations between newer AEDs, these with the presence of TPM possess a very promising potential as regards anticonvulsant activity and neurotoxic effects. The combinations of OXC + LTG or OXC + FBM, showing a distinct antagonism, should be avoided in epileptic patients. This non-randomized, uncontrolled, single-center study was conducted to evaluate the effects of zonisamide on intractable epilepsy in a primarily pediatric population. Twelve patients ranging in age from 18 months to 23 years were included in the study. All patients were diagnosed with intractable seizures. Adjunctive therapy with zonisamide was initiated at 100 mg once a day and increased, if needed, by 50-100 mg after 1 week to reach the maximal or therapeutic dosage depending on patient age and weight. Follow-up occurred in person or by phone at 2 weeks, 1 month, and every 3 months. All 12 patients responded favorably to adjunctive zonisamide. Five patients had subclinical status interrupted and stopped as evidenced by clinical examinations and EEG findings. These patients also became awake, alert, more attentive, and more interactive. An additional six patients experienced clinical and EEG improvement in their seizure frequency, duration, and severity. One patient with autonomic seizures showed EEG improvement in seizure frequency, duration, and severity; however, seizure prodrome control was not obtained. Adjunctive therapy with zonisamide benefited all patients in this study, despite the variation in symptoms and etiology.

C. Park, 1 Background: The comparison of region of interest between ictal PET and ictal SPECT will give us a good chance to widen the understanding of epileptogenesis. Serial imaging works were done in a case of non-convulsive status epilepticus partialy arising from occipital lobe. Case: 35-year-old women had suffered from visual dimness and twinkling light with clear focal electroclinical onset on EEG in right occipital lobe, lasting for 100-120 s which was mainly elementary visual aura without evolving to complex partial seizure or 2' generalized seizure. Diffusion WI and FLAIR image on MRI did not demonstrate any signal change on the relevant area. 18F-FDG PET and 99mTc-ECD SPECT images were obtained during ictal and interictal state. Localized hypermetabolic area and hyperperfusional area were noted on the right occipital area during ictus. Interictal PET and SPECT image were subtracted from ictal PET and SPECT respectively by SISCOM. There was no definite mismatch between the area of hypermetabolic state in 18F-FDG PET and the area of hyperperfusion in 99mTc-ECD SPECT when those were overlaid on MRI. Visual field cut documented by Humphery test done during ictus revealed left homonymous hemianopsia, which was recovered to near normal after complete disappearance of visual aura.

Animal models also support the use of levetiracetam in primary generalized epilepsy. To date no double-blind randomized controlled trials specifically to evaluate in patients with generalized seizures have been published. Moreover, clinical experience in open-label studies and case reports suggest that levetiracetam may be effective in the treatment of generalized seizures in adults and children. Methods: We selected and prospectively followed 16 patients (two male, 14 female), mean age 26 (range 13-42) years, affected by primary generalized epilepsy treated with levetiracetam. Seven patients had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, three myoclonic absence epilepsy, three juvenile absence epilepsy and three eyelid myoclonia with absences. Eight patients were on levetiracetam monotherapy, in the remaining patients levetiracetam was used as adjunctive therapy with other AEDs (VPA, LTG, VPA+LTG). Levetiracetam mean dose was 2000 mg/day and mean duration of exposure was 6 months. Results: 11 patients became seizure-free, in five cases we observed no change of seizure frequency (three patients had eyelid myoclonia and two myoclonic absence epilepsy).

Purpose: To evaluate the early efficacy of levetiracetam in adults with refractory partial epilepsy compared to that of topiramate during the first 15 days treatment in adult patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Methods: This single centre, add-on, open label comparative study was conducted in two phases. Patients with \u20212 seizures per month over an 8 week baseline period and who were receiving \u20212 concomitant AEDs then received either levetiracetam (250 mg/day) or topiramate (25 mg/day) as adjunctive therapy for 15 days according to physicians preference. Efficacy was evaluated by the percentage reduction in seizure frequency, the number of seizure-free days (SFDs) and number of seizure-free patients (SFPs) during the first 15 days of treatment compared to the last 15 days of the preceding baseline period. Results: One hundred and twenty-two patients with refractory partial epilepsy were included, 61 received levetiracetam and 61 topiramate. Demographic and clinical features of the groups were similar. The total number of SFDs during the preceding baseline 15 days was 648 with levetiracetam and 621 with topiramate; in the 15-day evaluation period SFDs increased to 736 (+17.7%) and 668 (+7.6%) respectively. Seven patients taking levetiracetam and five taking topiramate were seizure-free in the 15 days before treatment; increasing to 26 (42.6%) and 10 (16.4%) respectively during the 15-day add-on period. The total and mean number of SFDs was higher for levetiracetam compared to topiramate (P = 0.049). Conclusions: These results suggest levetiracetam to have a rapid onset of action with early efficacy as add-on therapy in patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Purpose: The aims of this study were to evaluate whether differences exist in homocyteine (Hcy) level in patients receiving different antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), monotherapy, and to determine the relationship between levels of Hcy and the vitamin cofactors required for Hcy metabolism (vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid). Patients and method: There were 18 and 57 epileptic patients in non-treatment and monotherapy groups (Carbamazepine, n: 19 ; Valproate, n: 22; Phenytoin, n: 16), respectively. Age and sex matched 11 healthy volunteers were included in control group. Hcy, Folic acid (FoA), vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 levels were examined both in patients and healthy volunteers. Results: All of the AEDs caused an increase in Hcy levels compared to controls and non-treatment group. There was no difference in Hcy levels between non-treatment and control groups. In patients receiving phenytoin the FoA level and in patients receiving carbamazepine vitamin B6 level was lower than control group. None of the levels of cofactors was not changed by valproate therapy. There was a negative correlation between levels of Hcy and FoA in patients receiving AED. And, there was a negative correlation with the duration of AED treatment and FoA level. Conclusion: This study showed that hyperhomocysteinemia may exist as a side effect of AED therapy. And, hyperhomocysteinemia was secondary to a decrease in vitamin B6 or FoA in patients treated with carbamazepine or phenytoin, respectively.

Also to analyse the frequency and correlation between epileptic seizures and the type and size of cerebrovascular lesion. Material and methods: We assessed the clinical records of 1099 patients with cerebrovascular diseases, admitted during a 5-year period at the Intensive Care Unit, Clinic of Neurology. Witnessed epileptic seizures occurred in 30 patients, age range 25-75 years, M 48 years. 23 patients had ischemic and seven patients had haemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease. Results: Partial motor seizures (PMS) were registered in two patients (6.6%); partial seizures with secondary tonic-clonic generalization (GTC) in 14 patients (46.5%), while primarily GTC seizures in 11 patients (36.5%). Status epilepticus (SE) was registered in three patients (10%) and it occurred only in the group of patients with ischemic CVD. Ten patients (30%) had EEG pathological changes (spike or sharp waves) and 14 (46.6%) had focal theta-delta waves. Antiepileptic therapy was applied to all patients (carbamazepin, phenitoin, barbiturates). Fifteen patients (50%) remained seizurefree during the hospital treatment. Six patients (20%) had lethal outcome (three patients with SE and three patients with GTC). Conclusion: The incidence of epileptic seizure as an initial symptom of CVD is 2.7%. Partial seizures with secondary tonic-clonic generalization are a dominant feature, and they are more frequent in patients with haemorrhagic CVD with subcortical localization. Frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures and status epilepticus indicate poorer prognosis. There are still about 30% of epileptic patients who are inadequately treated with currently available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in monotherapy. In such cases, rational polytherapy may offer an efficacious mode of treatment for these patients. We sought to assess with isobolography the exact types of interactions between loreclezole and conventional AEDs (valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) in the maximal electroshock (MES)-test in mice. To determine the exact character of observed inter-actions, a pharmacokinetic measure of conventional AED concentrations in plasma and brain homogenates was performed. With isobolography, all fixed-ratio combinations between loreclezole and carbamazepine were supra-additive (synergistic) in the MES-test, whereas the combinations of loreclezole with phenytoin displayed pure additive interactions. Only, the mixture of loreclezole with valproate or phenobarbital, at fixed-ratio of 1:1, exerted supra-additive interaction against electroconvulsions. The remaining fixedratio combinations tested (1:3 and 3:1) were additive. Pharmacokinetic estimation of conventional AED concentrations revealed that loreclezole considerably raised free plasma and total brain concentrations of carbamazepine and phenytoin. Likewise, loreclezole significantly elevated free plasma levels of valproate, having no impact on total brain concentrations of the latter drug. In contrast, neither the free plasma nor total brain concentrations of phenobarbital were affected by loreclezole. Finally, combinations of loreclezole with valproate, phenobarbital or carbamazepine may be worthy to consider in clinical practice, whereas, the application of loreclezole with phenytoin should be avoided in patients with intractable seizures. Purpose: Comparison of efficacy and tolerability of lamotrigine (LTG) and valproate (VPA) in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Methods: Prospective study of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy, which were randomized to monotherapy with LTG or VPA, and followed up for a minimum period of 6 months. Patients failing initial monotherapy were calculated as unsuccessful treatment. End point variable were retention on treatment and seizure freedom for study period. Statistical analysis was performed for alpha = 0.05; results are expressed as confidence intervals. Results: Fifty-five patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy (median age 36 years, range 18-76), were randomized to VPA (n = 30) or LTG (n = 25). Forty-two patients (64-86%) had localization-related epilepsy and eight (8-26%) had idiopathic generalized epilepsy, and in five (4-20%) seizures could not be classified. Twenty-two (56-86%) patients randomized to VPA were still taking it at the end of study period as were 19 (57-89%) patients randomized to LTG. Seventeen (57%, 39-73%) patients with VPA have remained seizure free for the study period, as have 13 (52%, 33-70%) patients on LTG. Efficacy of each drug in various seizure types did not differ significantly.

Pharmacoeconomic analyses are designed to help policy makers determine the best treatment alternative for a given condition. In recent years the quality of life and its improvement has had a dominant role in the process of decision making, and the treatment alternatives with best results in this matter have been the preferred ones. Aim: To present the pharmacoeconomic profile of different drugs used as monotherapy in epilepsy with primary generalized seizures and focal epilepsy with secondary generalized seizures. Methods: Patients of both sexes aging from 18-73 years (mean 27.47), treated on monotherapy with Carbamazepine, Valproate and Oxcarbazepine were evaluated on their costsdirect and indirect and quality of life. Data were acquired through interviews and completion of the QOLIE-31 questionnaire. Effectiveness criteria were seizure reduction, type and number of adverse reactions. Results: Seizure reduction was respectively: 80 \u00b1 21.55% for carbamazepine, 92.05 \u00b1 19.5% for Valproate and 70.00 \u00b1 27.39% for oxcarbazepine.

Treatment of epilepsy is of particular concern for women of child bearing potential due to unintended side effects leading to co-morbid conditions. Retrospective data for female patients age 18-45, newly initiating on AEDs were assessed to examine differences in costs of care between these newer treatments, i.e. in-patient, out-patient, emergency services and pharmaceutical costs. Methods: The 1999-2003Q1 MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounter Database of health insurance claims for employees/dependents affiliated with large Fortune 500 companies was used to identify female patients diagnosed with epilepsy and newly initiating on newer AEDs (lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, levetiractam, topiramate, felbamate, gabapentin, tiagabine, and zonisamide). Patients were followed from initiation of AED treatment until termination of enrollment or administrative close of the database. Demographics, comorbid conditions, health care resource utilization, and costs were assessed by type of AED therapy. Results: The study sample (n = 471) with an average followup of 1.25 years. Mean annualized total healthcare costs were significantly lower (t-test, all P < 0.05) for lamotrigine ($8495), as compared to oxcarbazepine ($9292), levitiracetam ($30 007) topiramate ($13 215), other new AEDs ($20 821) and the combinations of newer AEs ($19 656). The primary differences in costs were due to variances in outpatient care and pharmaceutical expenditures.

Introduction: The use of anticonvulsants in survivors of severe traumatic brain injury has two aspects. The first relates to the therapeutic use to prevent further seizures in patients who already developed post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). The second and more controversial aspect is the practice of administering prophylactic anticonvulsant to those who have sustained severe head injuries. Objective: To assess the incidence of PTE in patient with head trauma, to determine are the available data sufficient to support a practice standard for the role of antiseizure prophylaxis and the correlation of the site of brain lesion and epileptic seizures. Methods: The group of 75 patients (54 male and female) who sustained head injuries were followed up during 3 years. The usual clinical investigation was performed including; EEG, CT scan. Results: The incidence of early seizures was found in nine (12%) cases, PTE was developed in 16 (21.3%). PTS was higher in those who had moderate and severe head injuries and frontal, parietal and temporal lesions appeared as a higher risk factor for development of PTE. In late post-traumatic epilepsy: in 1/3 of patients the frequency of seizures were rare, in 1/3 occurred periodically and in 1/3 of patients the sizures remained very frequent besides antiepileptic therapy. The most common type of seizures were focal and generalized. Conclusion: The prophylactic use of standard antiepileptic phenytoin does not prevent development of late post-traumatic epilepsy, a promising approach should be to prevent the chronic evolution of pathologic changes contributing to PTS. Introduction: Epilepsy becomes important forensically for the effects on consciousness and common mental disorders which may be associated by offending. Objective: The main goal of this study was to identify the association of offending and epilepsy due to the type of crime, evidence of seizures activity at the time of crime and EEG findings. Methods: The group consists of 30 epileptic patients (26 male and four female) who were detained at Special Institution due to the various type of crime: 22 (73%) committed murder, three (10%) arson, two (6.6%) rape and three (10%) committed traffic offences. The type of the psychiatric disorders at the time of crime, EEG findings were analysed. Results: Ictal symptoms of complex partial seizures were found in 36% of patients, interictal psychotic disorder in 16.6%, interictal episodic emotional changes in 13.3%, persistent epileptic personality in 20% and a confusional state suspect to epilepsy in 13.3%. EEG was normal in 60%, epileptic focus in the frontotemporal areas registered in 26.5% (mostly in murder cases), and EEG with non-specific changes in 13.3%. There was no satisfactory seizure control in 80% of patients probably due to the non-compliance. Conclusion: Most violence committed by epileptics seems to occur between fits mostly due to their personality impairment and episodic emotional disturbances.

Medulloblastoma as localized in posterior area and in left frontal lobe. He was treated by surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. He observed an antiepileptic treatment by phenobarbital since a tonico-clonic generalized seizure in 1988. A CT-Scan was realized in emergency unit and described a left parieto-occipital oedema with a contrast enhancement. Two CSF examinations were realized and normal. The MRI showed a left parieto-occipital T2 high signal with gadolinium enhancement in T1. During his stay in hospital, the patient described many visual phenomena, consisting of visual hallucinations in the right field of vision. The video-monitoring EEG can record one partial epileptic seizure with a rythmic discharge in the left parieto-occipital region. A new MRI was practice 3 weeks ago and was normal. Conclusion: This observation illustrates transitory abnormalities of MRI associated with repeated partial epileptic seizures. Background: Seizure frequency and number of concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are characteristics that reflect severity of illness. We evaluated patients treated with pregabalin in randomized placebo-controlled trials to determine whether these markers influenced degree of response to treatment. Data here reported were from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on study, consisting of 8 week baseline and 12 week double-blind phases. Methods: Patients were refractory to two AEDs at maximally tolerated doses, experienced \u20216 partial seizures during baseline with no 4-week seizure-free period, and were currently receiving 1-3 AEDs. Patients were randomized to placebo or 50, 150, 300, or 600 mg/day pregabalin, BID. Efficacy was assessed by seizure-frequency reduction and responder rate (>50% seizure reduction from baseline).

Material and methods: The examined group consisted of 20 patients with epilepsy in the mean age 37.3 \u00b1 10.7 years (mean duration of disease -17.2 \u00b1 14.5 years). The control group consisted of 28 healthy volunteers. SSR was recorded bilaterally from the palms and soles using surface electrodes (after electric stimulation of the median nerve). Ewing's battery consisted of five cardiovascular tests. The questionnaire assessing autonomic functions had 89 questions about different autonomic symptoms.

However the mechanisms of sleep related headache are not clearly known yet. Both sleep deprivation and excessive sleep may result in headaches. Objectives: Although prolonged sleep is a recognized cause of headaches, insufficient sleep is rarely mentioned in the literature, therefore we investigated the clinical characteristics of sleep deprivation headache (SDH) to obtain some preliminary informations for future studies about SDH. Methods: A survey of 15 questions was completed by 416 medical students about the clinical features of SDH. Results: All but two responded. Of the 414 medical students, 287 (69.3%) experienced SDH. Female students (75%) experienced SDH more frequently than male students (67.27%). Less than 4-h sleep evoked most of SDH. Most frequent headache sites were frontotemporal areas. Half of the students with SDH experienced throbbing headache. Most of SDH sustained <3 h. Conclusions: The incidence of SDH was higher than that of a previous informal report. Results of the present study showed that the characteristics of SDH could be very varied and fairly different from other headache types as well as tension headache. Therefore these findings led us to conclude that SDH is an independent type of headache and the pathogenesis could be quite different to other types of headache.

Background: Topiramate effectively prevents migraine in adults, as shown in three randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trials (n > 1500). Post hoc analyses were performed to assess the effectiveness/safety of topiramate (50, 100, and 200 mg/day) in the adolescent participants (12-18 years) of these trials. Methods: The double-blind phase of these three trials included titration (up to 8 weeks) and maintenance (18 weeks).

Based on this analysis, Topiramate 100 mg/day is an effective and welltolerated target dose for most patients. Introduction: Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) is a polyetiological clinical syndrome characterized by lesion of cranium nerves passing through the superior palpebral fissure (I branch of V, III, IV, VI). More often THS is caused by autoimmune mechanisms and by supra-infraclinoid aneurysms of the interior carotid artery (AVA). Aim: 90 patients who developed autoimmune THS and 8 AVA patients underwent clinical, immunological, MRI, MRA, angiographical correlations. Results: The study has shown that more often women (71.4%) develop AVA with no apparent cause. It begins with ptosis, has no orbital pain, no effect from glucocorticoid, no recurrent course. During MRI, MRA and angiography supraclinoid AVA localization was detected in 62.5%, infraclinoid in 25%, and plural AVA localization in 12.5%. Autoimmune THS is equally developed by women and men. More often it follows inflammatory factors. It begins with diplopia, has severe orbital pain and a significant effect from glucocorticoid. MRI detects a thickening of the cavernous sinus external wall in 10%. Immunological tests of blood and spinal fluid showed a high level of proinflammatory cytokins (IL 1b, IL 9, FNTa). Conclusion: Although clinical picture of THS of aneurysmatical and autoimmune genesis is similar, the complex examination allows to determine the reason for THS and to carry out a differential therapy. Objectives: To determine the variability between and within individuals of pharmacokinetic data for zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite 183C91, following administration of zolmitriptan nasal spray 5 mg. Methods: Healthy adult volunteers (n = 18) received a single intranasal dose of zolmitriptan 5 mg on three occasions (separated by washout periods = 70 h and = 2 weeks). Blood samples were collected 30 min before dosing and from 2 min to 16 h post-dose. Zolmitriptan and 183C91 plasma concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography and electrospray mass spectrometry. The estimations of intra-and intersubject variation were performed using an ANOVA mixed linear model including terms for fixed effects of gender and period. Results: Quantifiable plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan (=0.1 ng/ml) were measured in 16 of 18 patients at 2 min in = 1 period. Mean plasma concentrations were similar in each period ( Figure 1 ). Coefficients of variation for AUC were 35.3% between volunteers and 21.6% within volunteers for zolmitriptan, and 25.5 and 22.8%, respectively, for 183C91.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4046, "end": 4054, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF34"}], "section": "P2210"}, {"text": "The level of pharmacokinetic variability within and between individuals was low; variability estimates for zolmitriptan and 183C91 AUC within individuals were even lower.

The total pooled population was 1105 subjects (placebo, n = 374; 5 mg n = 377, 20 mg n = 354). All subjects self-treated a single moderate or severe attack. Results: Pooled results for SNS 20 mg demonstrate significantly greater headache relief (severity 3/2 down to 1/0) compared to placebo at 30 min (39% vs. 30%, P = 0.016), 1 h (59% vs. 48%, P = 0.007) and 2 h (67% vs. 57%, P = 0.005); and for SNS 5 mg at 2 h (64% vs. 57%, P = 0.037).

Methods: Data were combined from 19 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (n = 11 400) evaluating eletriptan 20 mg (E20) or 40 mg (E40), or sumatriptan 50 mg (S50) or 100 mg (S100) alone or head-to-head. The timecourse of dose-response relationship for pain relief was analyzed by random-effects logistic regression model. Entry criteria included treatment of moderate-to-severe migraine (within 4-8 h of onset) and no rescue medication within 2 h. Results were based on data from first dose of first attack treated. Pain relief was measured using a standard four-point scale. The effect of encapsulating sumatriptan was also assessed. Results: E40 demonstrated significant clinical benefit versus S100 at points up to 4 h post-treatment, greatest around 1.5-2.0 h. Mean therapeutic gain (drug minus placebo response) at 2 h was 40% for E40 vs. 31% with S100 [difference at 2 h of 9.1% (90% CI: 7.4-11.5%) for E40 vs. S100]. The benefit (difference between therapeutic gains) of E40 over S100 was maintained at >5% from 45 min to 4 h post-treatment. Benefit was lowest at 4 h, when mean therapeutic gain was 49% (E40) vs. 44% (S100). Response to E20 was similar to S100. Both E20 and E40 were superior to S50. Encapsulated sumatriptan (for blinding) showed no significant difference versus unencapsulated sumatriptan on time course of response.

Methods: So far nine (at the date of presentation planned 15) volunteers have been examined with fMRI. Consecutive stimulation of both fingers using a neurograph was administered in four intensities. In one set the stimuli were presented at random with instructions to discriminate them, and in an other set stimuli in only two strengths (none and painful) were presented with the instruction to try to suppress the feeling of pain. FMRI Data were aquired with a Siemens Symphony 1.5 T scanner. Data analysis was done with SPM99. Results: In the first task of discrimination, results by other authors could be replicated. Activations occurred in primary sensory areas, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Stronger stimuli elicited insular responses: If not painful posterior insular, if painful anterior insular activation. In the second task there seemed to be a connection between the course of suppression of pain and activation passing from the anterior to posterior insula. Some interesting single-person data will be presented leading to the hypothesis of different individual mechanisms of pain suppression. Conclusions: All healthy volunteers succeeded in a partial suppression of perception of pain during the fMRI experiment.

Methods: Open-label, multicenter, prospective comparative study in migraine patients attending neurology clinics. Patients treated the first attack with their ergots, NSAIDs or analgesics and the second attack with rizatriptan 10 mg, and recorded the pain intensity and functional disability at baseline and at 2 h and the time at which they were able to function normally. ANOVA or Student t-test and Chi square, Fisher exact test or McNemar test were used for univariate, independent or paired comparisons. Hazard ratios [HR(95% CI)] were calculated using Cox models for time of return to normal function (adjusted by treatment, sex, migraine frequency, type of migraine and baseline pain intensity). Breslow's exact test was used to compare distributions. Results: 1353 patients (76% female; 53% with less than three migraine attacks per month) completed the study. 49% of patients were normal at 2 h with rizatriptan 10 mg compared to NSAIDs (22%; P < 0.001), Analgesics (21%, P < 0.001) or ergots (17%, P < 0.001).

This study compared the functional disability and quality of life of previously diagnosed or undiagnosed migraineurs and individuals with non-migraine headaches in PC. Design and methods: Patients (n = 451) reporting recent headaches (i.e. within the past 3 months) during a routine PC visit completed the self-administered ID Migraine TM screen-er1. Subsequently, patients were referred to a headache expert for a diagnostic interview based on IHS criteria that included an evaluation using the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire, the Henry Ford Hospital Headache Disability Inventory (HDI) and the Migraine-Specific Qualityof-Life Questionnaire (MSQ). Disability outcomes and healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) were compared in migraineurs (diagnosed or undiagnosed) and non-migraineurs. Results: The HDI-total score, the MIDAS-total score and all three MSQ functional/emotional subscale scores of headache patients who were positive on the ID Migraine TM screener (whether previously diagnosed or undiagnosed) indicated significantly more impairment in comparison with nonmigraineurs (P < 0.0001). The proportion of patients with MIDAS Class-III-IV level of disability was higher in migraineurs with (74%) or without a previous diagnosis (64%) than in patients with non-migraine headache (25%). Analysis of variance showed that there was a linear relationship between the number of positive responses on ID Migraine TM and functional disability and HRQoL-with a significant difference between those with 0-1 vs. 2-3 symptoms (P = 0.0001). Conclusions: Undiagnosed migraineurs frequently have high levels of impairment and would benefit from diagnosis and treatment. Triptans, agonists of 5HT1 receptors, are the most effective treatment for migraine. In rare cases, coronary complications due to vasospasm have been described. Despite the high frequency of migraines in young individuals, few cases in the literature have implicated this treatment in the occurrence of ischemic stroke. We report three cases of migraine patients who had an ischemic stroke while undergoing treatment with triptans: two women and one man, 21, 43 and 56 years old respectively, having few vascular risk factors. Clinical signs started with a headache having a migraine character accompanied by neurological symptoms in one case. Following administration of different triptans, ischemic neurological complications appeared which were definitive in two cases and regressed in the other. The work up revealed an internal carotid occlusion in two cases. Migraine is a well known risk factor for stroke in young individuals. Present data do not suggest that triptans treatment increases this risk. In animal experimentation, these molecules cause a vasoconstriction of carotid arteries. Our cases seem to indicate that this mechanism of triptan could be the origin of carotid thrombosis or have a repercussion on the cerebral circulation which occurs an ischemic stroke in man.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2218"}, {"text": "Oral eletriptan versus subcutaneous sumatriptan: An open-label crossover study of patient preference in the acute treatment of migraine C.

Methods: In this multicenter, open crossover study, adult migraineurs (n = 311) who had used suma-sc were randomized to E80 or suma-sc for two three-attack treatment periods, followed by an optional three-attack extension phase during which they could choose either medication for each attack. The primary outcome was medication preference, rated on a five-point global scale. Results: After the crossover phase, 51% of patients preferred E80; 43% preferred suma-sc. Reasons for preferring E80 included ease of use (24%), absence of adverse events (22%), type of medication (16%) and lack of headache recurrence (12%). During the extension phase, when patients could choose their medication, 69% of patients treated more migraine attacks with E80 than with suma-sc.

The range of administered dosage was 50-300 mg/day with slow titration. The prevention of migraine with TPM was scheduled for 6 months. The incidence of paresthesia was 39 patients (46%) treated for average period up to 9.5 months in epileptic patients and 38 patients (76%) up to 3.8 months in migraneous patients. 50 mg/day TPM was the most common initial dosage which produced paresthesia in both groups. Although it is mostly mild and intermittent, three epileptic patients (8%) and four migraneous patients (11%) were withdrawn from their medication due to severe, intolerable paresthesia. It was disappeared at average 3 months without specific treatment in epileptic patients. However, it still remained at 6 months in 10 of 16 migraneous patients who finished migraine prevention. Paresthesia as an adverse event during TPM therapy is common and sometimes, lasting and discomfortable even in the lower dosage, especially migraneous patients. It should be well considered as an important adverse event related to drug tolerability for TPM. The aim of this study was to assess microvascular blood flow of extracranial districts in migraine patients during and outside attacks. We studied 20 patients with migraine without aura (out and during spontaneous attacks) and 20 controls. We used Laser Doppler flowmetry and measured cutaneous responses to hyperthermic stimulation on symmetric skin areas of the face, neck and fingers of the upper limbs bilaterally. No differences between patients and controls were found in flowmetry on the face and neck in the basal assessment.

The remaining five patients (25%) had no significant changes in flowmetry in any of the studied areas.

Headaches are one of the most common reasons people seek medical help; approximately 25% of women and 8% of men suffer from migraine at some time in their lives. The precise cause of migraine is unknown, but it is probably related to chemical changes in the blood vessels supplying the brain and its coverings. These changes may involve constriction and dilatation in some brain blood vessels. Headaches are disorders in which multiple factors, including environmental and genetic factors, are involved. In a previous study it has been hypothesized a protective role of HLA-DR2 antigen, providing additional basis for the proposed genetic heterogeneity in headache. The pathophysiology of headache is still controversial, although sterile inflammation plays a key role at the cranial vascular endothelial level. The cytokines tumour necrosis factor alpha and beta (TNF-alpha, TNF-beta) are a polypeptide effectors of the inflammatory reaction and of endothelial function. We have studied serum levels of TNFalpha in 30 headache patients and 35 unrelated healthy subjects from the same geographical area (southern Italy), randomly selected, served as controls.

We tested this association in patients with headache attributed to disorders of the neck (cervicogenic headache) and in patients with low back pain. Patients and methods: During a 2-year period 298 consecutive patients with the clinical diagnosis of cervicogenic headache (n = 182) or low back pain (n = 116) filled in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Disability was scored by the MIDAS questionnaire reflecting the number of days with lost or decreased work, household and social activities. Nonparametric tests and multiple general regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: Older age and female gender were associated with higher BDI score (Spearman R = 0.11; P = 0.048; Man-Whitney test P = 0.043). Pain frequency and severity did not differ between the two groups, but the MIDAS score was significantly higher in the low back pain than in the headache group. In multivariate analyses pain intensity, pain frequency and disability were significantly associated with the BDI score, whereas age, gender and pain type were not significant factors in determining the severity of depressive symptoms. When disability was the dependent variable, pain frequency, pain type (headache or low back pain), BDI and pain intensity were significant, while gender and age were not significant predictors. Conclusion: Disability, but not the severity of depressive symptoms is affected by the location of pain caused by the disease of the spine. Disability and depressive symptoms are interrelated. Pain frequency and pain intensity have significant effects both on the severity of depressive symptoms and on disability.

Blood flow disturbances connected with increased cerebrovascular reactivity in children with migraine can be observed. Pharmacoprophylaxis with lamotrigine probably may have an influence on these hemodynamic changes and the clinical status.

An enhanced response to triptans when used to treat breakthrough migraines of patients on topiramate (a migraine prevention agent) has yet to be shown. Methods: 69 patients who experienced four to eight migraine attacks during a 4-week prospective baseline phase were given topiramate, which was titrated in weekly increments of 25 mg/ day until reaching the effective (50-150 mg/day) or maximum tolerated dose. The MIDAS questionnaire was completed at study baseline and endpoint. Headache frequency, duration, severity, and triptan responsiveness were recorded. Results: 66 patients completed the trial. Topiramate showed a = 50% reduction in headache frequency from baseline in 72.6% of completers. Mean MIDAS scores were 19.3 at baseline and 5.8 after 12 weeks. 16 of 29 patients unresponsive to triptans at baseline responded well following topiramate administration. Five patients reported mild adverse events including drowsiness and memory impairment (three of five study dropouts). One of these patients reported paresthesia, and another reported dysarthria. In the patient with dysarthria, topiramate was discontinued, restarted a week later at 12.5 mg/day and titrated to 100 mg/day with no adverse events. 51 patients reported body weight reductions (mean weight reduction, 4.8 kg; range 1.5-9 kg). Conclusions: The significant decreases in MIDAS values suggest that topiramate is effective for migraine prevention.

T. Mathew, 1 C. Sikes, 2 M. Almas 2 and J.

Complete remission of headache pain and absence of all associated symptoms, as well as return to fully normal levels of functioning, may be considered the most stringent outcome. Complete symptom remission has rarely been reported at 2 h, and never at 24 h. We report here a retrospective analysis of complete symptom remission in a previously reported double-blind trial comparing eletriptan-40 mg (E40, n = 769), sumatriptan-100 mg (S100, n = 784), and placebo (PBO, n = 394)2. Criteria for sustained complete symptom remission were met by patients who achieved complete symptom remission at 2 h, reported a similar absence of symptoms at 24 h, reported no headache recurrence and took no second dose or rescue medication (return of mild pain between 4 and 24 h was not recorded). At 2 h, significantly more patients on E40 (32.1%; P < 0.0001) and S100 (24.0%; P < 0.0001) achieved complete symptom remission compared with PBO (5.0%). Complete symptom remission at 2 h was also significantly higher for E40 compared with S100 (P = 0.0003).

Material and method: The investigation included 28 patients aged 22-56 years with migraine with or without aura diagnosed following the IHS criteria, two to six attacks/month and without migraine prevention. The assessment included pain relief, percentage of pain-free patients, degree of incapacitation, presence/absence of concomitant symptoms at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.3 and 4 h post-administration, percentage of recurrence over 24 h, percentage of adverse effects. Results: 20 patients completed the follow-up; each suffered 30 migraine attacks, with five attacks treated with two doses of three triptans. Ten-milligram rizatriptan showed the highest percentage of pain relief and freedom from pain. The 5-mg dose corresponded in efficacy to 100-mg sumatriptan and 5-mg zolmitriptan. Therapeutic effect was the fastest for both doses of rizatriptan. The least tendency to recurrence was achieved in 5-mg zolmitriptan. Ten-milligram rizatriptan, 100-mg sumatriptan and 2.5-mg zolmitriptan did not differ in this respect, while 5-mg rizatriptan and 50-mg sumatriptan manifested the highest percentage of recurrence. Triptan tolerance was better at lower doses, where the three drugs showed almost no differences. At high doses the tolerance of zolmitriptan and rizatriptan was comparable and superior to that of sumatriptan. Conclusions: Triptans differ in their activity in particular patients.

We assessed the credibility features of the web sites: evidence hierarchy, source and currency as well as accuracy of contents. Relation between features of web site credibility and level of accuracy of contents were expressed by cross tabulation.

Background: Abnormalities of primary motor cortex (M1) excitability have been demonstrated in patients with cerebellar ataxia by means of TMS. These alterations point to changes in the activity of different M1 neurotransmitters populations related to cerebellar dysfunction. Methods: We investigated the short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), the duration of cortical silent period (CSP) to singlepulse TMS and the long-latency intracortical inhibition (LICI) to paired-pulse TMS in the intrinsic hand muscles of nine patients with pure cerebellar ataxia. We evaluated whether these TMS parameters were correlated to measures of ataxia, scored with the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), using Spearman's correlation test (P < 0.05). Results: SAI was significantly correlated to upper-limb ICARS score (P < 0.02) but not with total score. The other TMS measures were not significantly correlated with clinical scores. Conclusions: Different M1 inhibitory functions are impaired in cerebellar ataxia. Some of these functions are involved in early stages of the disease.

Kourtesi The purpose of this study was to assess pulmonary function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in relation to motor disability and its impact on fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). 70 PD patients were studied. Their overall disability, fatigue and HRQOL were assessed by means of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Fatigue Severity Questionnaire and SF-36. Pulmonary function was assessed by flow volume curve spirometry. Respiratory muscle force was measured by the maximal inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory pressure (MEP). Arterial blood gases were also measured. Mean percentage forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were within normal range (FVC = 80.83 \u00b1 19.98; FEV1 = 88.05 \u00b1 21.64). However abnormal FCV and FEV1 values were observed in 45.8 and 32.4% of patients respectively. Mean MIP (41.58 \u00b1 25) was below normal levels. Mean MEP (58.04 \u00b1 27.43) was within normal range, but in 36.5% of patients it was below normal. Arterial blood gases were normal. FVC, MIP and MEP values correlated negatively with UPDRS scores. Some SF-36 scales scores were significantly lower in patients with abnormal respiratory test values, however correlation was not significant after controlling for motor disability effect. Fatigue score showed no correlation also. Our findings indicate that subclinical pulmonary dysfunction is present in a considerable percentage of PD patients. Their main respiratory problem arises from disturbances in respiratory muscle force. This should be taken into consideration in the rehabilitation management of PD patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate to which degree the pathologic substrate is reversal in the treatment of Wilson disease (WD) and is there any correlation between clinical course and MRI changes during the follow-up period. Initial Posters, Monday 6 September brain MRI was performed in 35 patients with neurologically symptomatic Wilson's disease. All 35 initial MRI revealed abnormalities. Most common abnormalities were bilateral high signal intensity (HSI) on T2-weighted (T2W) images in putamen (70%), globus pallidus (46%), and thalamus (30%). HIS lesions in the brain stem were also common especially in mesencephalon (49%) and substantia nigra (38%). Brain MRI reexamination and clinical follow-up was performed in 19 patients after 3.5-7 years of treatment. Two of them temporarily discontinued medications, however the therapy was again administrated when clinical deterioration appeared. HIS lesions improved in most of 19 patients with good correlation between neurological clinical course of disease. Gradual resolution of the lesions in our study was significant more prominent in patients continuously treated 5 years and longer strongly confirming the marked role of the chronic treatment in the course of WD. Since all lesions appear to be at least partly responsive to chronic administration of chelating agents it seems to be rather questionable if bilateral T2W signal increase really represent gliosis, necrosis and cavitation. Our results suggest that those signal alteration may be consistent with focal edema and inflamatory changes. Introduction: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with considerable range and overlap of phenotypic expression. The cerebellar syndrome is obviously the core feature of the disease, and, in some 'pure' forms, its only manifestation. Objectives: To characterize Portuguese families with pure ADCA. Patients and methods: Through a population-based survey of hereditary ataxias in Portugal, covering 8.5 million individuals, we identified 199 unrelated ADCA families, of which 20 were considered pure. All families were screened for the MJD, DRPLA, SCA1, 2, 6-8, 10, 12, 14 and 17 mutations. Results: Machado-Joseph disease represented 55% of the families (n = 109), dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 3.5% (n = 7), other ADCA with molecular diagnosis 6% (SCA2 = 4, SCA8 = 4, SCA6 = 2, SCA7 = 1, SCA17 = 1). Pure cerebellar forms represented 10%, only one with molecular diagnosis (SCA14). Clinical data was available for 47 patients. Mean age of onset was 50.3 years (18-75). Mode of onset was gait ataxia in 76.6%, combined ataxia and dysarthria in 19.2% and isolated dysarthria in 4.2%. Spasmodic cough was reported in five (antedating ataxia by a decade in one). Discussion: A wide range of age-at-onset was found in the families studied, nonetheless the majority had a late onset. The most common presentation was gait ataxia, although some patients had dysarthria as the first symptom. A peculiar mode of onset -spasmodic coughing -was present in 25% of the pure forms. In Portuguese families pure cerebellar ataxia represents an important part of the phenotypic spectrum of ADCA (and the majority lacking molecular diagnosis). The aim of the study was to assess the level of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr) and choline (Cho) and others (glutamate/glutamine, myoinositol, lactate, lipids) in the lentiform nucleus of patients with IPD and parkinsonian syndromes. Spectroscopy voxels were localized to both lentiform nucleus guided by T-1 and T2-weighted axial images. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1HMRS) was carried out in 33 patients (16 patients have 1-2 Hoehn/Yahr stages, seven patients have three stage and 10 patients have four stage) with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), 15 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), three patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 10 healthy age-matched controls.

However at late stage IPD NAA/Cho ratio was significantly reduced, but Cho/Cr was significantly increased compared (was because of an increase in choline) to controls and no significant compared to PSP, MSA group. We observed high lactate and lipid levels in three cases of atypical parkinsonism. 1HMRS is non-invasive method that can be helpful in differentiation of IPD (in early stages) with atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Myoclonus dystonia (MD) is a movement disorder with involuntary jerks and dystonic contraction. Autosomal dominant MD is alcohol responsive and associated with mutation in the epsilon-sarcoglican gene (EGCE) and with missence change in the D2 dopamin receptor (DRD2) gene. We identified 23 familial MD cases from five MD families along with 39 unaffected family members and five sporadic MD cases. We present the clinical and mutational analyses of all of our cases. Mode of transmission was dominant with reduced penentrance. All 12 exons and flanking intron regions of the SCGE gene were tested for mutations using SSPC and DHPLC analyses followed by cycle sequencing of PCR product in cases of suspected sequence alterations. Seven exons of DRD2 gene were tested by SSPC analysis and all samples were tested for the GAG deletion and newly detected 18bp deletion in exons 5 of DYT1 gene. We detected two SGCE mutations, one GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene and no mutation in the remaining cases, suggesting that MD is a genetic heterogenous. In conclusion, SGCE mutations are relatively rare cause of MD in our population and the GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene may mimic the typical MD pheno-type in single case. Genes other than the three tested or nongenetic factors may contribute to the etiology of MD in our set of mutation negative Serbian familial and sporadic MD cases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2252"}, {"text": "The effect of donepezil on cognitive dysfunction in Huntington's disease: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study E.

Patients with early HD have a wide range of cognitive impairments, and several studies suggest that striatal cholinergic dysfunction may play a role in the cognitive features of HD. We investigated whether donepezil HCL, improves cognitive function in HD. Design and methods: 30 patients (16 women and 14 men), mean age 48.6 years (range 27-67), mean disease duration 4.7 years (range 1-14), mean MMSE of 27.3 (range 24-30), were randomly assigned to treatment with donepezil or placebo. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 6 weeks (5 mg dose) and 12 weeks (10 mg dose). The primary outcome variable was the difference between ADAS-cog score at 10 mg and at baseline. Secondary outcome measures included WAISS-III subscales, UHDRS-FAS, UHDRS-SDMT, Stroop, Digit ordering number, and functional status (SIP subscales). Groups were compared via Wilcoxon rank-sum test applied to difference scores. Results: The two treatment arms were comparable at baseline with a mean score of ADAS-cog of 9.8 + 3.3 and 11.3 + 4.9 in placebo and Aricept group, respectively. There was no significant change in ADAS-cog score on the 10 mg dose (-0.1 + 2.9 in the placebo group, and 0.9 + 3.7 in the Aricept group, P = 0.55).

Giladi, 1 Background: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common, disabling symptom in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). This ancillary LARGO substudy investigated the specific effect of rasagiline, a novel, potent, second-generation MAO-B inhibitor, on the severity of FOG in levodopa-treated PD patients with motor fluctuations. Methods: Consenting patients (n = 454) from participating sites were randomized to receive rasagiline (1 mg once-daily, n = 150), entacapone (200 mg with each levodopa dose, n = 150) or placebo (n = 154). Patients were assessed at baseline and week 10. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline score of the FOG-Questionnaire (FOG-Q, maximum = 24). The correlation between the effects on total daily OFF time (diary-based data) and FOG-Q was also evaluated (Pearson correlation). Change in FOG-Q was also analysed in the mild-moderate (75% of patients; FOG-Q-15) and severe FOG subgroups (FOG-Q > 15). Results: At baseline, patients had a mean FOG-Q score of 12. Patients receiving rasagiline significantly decreased FOG-Q score by 1.2 points, compared with a 0.5 point decrease in the placebo group (P = 0.045). Patients receiving entacapone showed a trend towards therapeutic effect versus placebo (1.1 point decrease, P = 0.066). The correlations between the effects on total daily OFF duration and FOG-Q score were 0.13, 0.25 and 0.32, for rasagiline, entacapone and placebo, respectively, which may indicate a weak correlation between these two endpoints. Rasagiline significantly reduced FOG severity by 0.94 points versus placebo in patients with mild-moderate FOG (P = 0.02). This was not observed in the severe FOG subgroup. Conclusions: Rasagiline significantly improved FOG in levodopa-treated PD patients with motor fluctuations. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of ropinirole and pergolide. Background: Dopamine agonists as an adjunct to LD can reduce the motor fluctuations and delay long-term LD complications. Methods: A total of 58 patients treated with LD before were enrolled. Patients were assessed using the UPDRS at baseline and weekly for the first month and every 2 weeks for the next 2 months. Results: We identified 29 patients with a mean age of 73 (age range 48-89) who got ropinirole as adjunct to LD and 29 patients matched for age got pergolide as adjunctive. Mean ropinirole dose was 6.24 mg (dose range 3-12 mg) and mean pergolide dose was 2.21 mg (dose range 0.75-4 mg). The ropinirole group had 22.4% improvement in average UPDRS scores at the end of the study when compared with baseline while the pergolide group only had 9.54% improvement. Adverse effects were in 17.24% of the patients in the ropinirole group and 31% of the patients in the pergolide group. Total LD dose was reduced in 34.48% of the patients in pergolide group while ropinirole group showed 55.17% reduction. Ropinirole decreased the 'off' period in 58.62% of the patients and pergolide decreased the 'off' state in 37.93% of the patients.

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in stereotaxic conditions before surgery. Brain parenchymal (BP), caudate nucleus (CN), putamen (Put), pallidum (Pal) and red nucleus (RN) volumes and the mesencephalic surface (MS) were measured and normalized as percentages of the intracranial volume. Clinical evaluation was performed 1 month before and 6 months after surgery. The normalized BP volume was lower in patients with older age, longer disease duration and lower frontal score and was not predictive of the post-operative outcome. The residual scores for activities of daily living and parkinsonian motor disability (with levodopa treatment before surgery and/or STN stimulation after surgery) were lower in patients with a larger normalized MS. The normalized CN volume was predictive of the pre and post-operative levodopa-equivalent dosage. In conclusion, brain atrophy is not an exclusion criteria for neurosurgery, indicating that the neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological characteristics of patients are the best predictive factors for neurosurgery. The fact that the larger the normalized MS, the lower the parkinsonian motor disability after surgery with STN stimulation suggests that it is a new predictive factor of the post-operative outcome, likely as a result of additional brain non-dopaminergic lesions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2260"}, {"text": "Differentiation of primary writing tremor and writer's cramp using quantitative tremor assessment by the spectral analysis of spiral drawing on graphic digitizing tablet S.

We confirmed the significant negative correlation between the amount of CAG repeats and the age at the onset of HD (P = 0.01). We found decreased activities of RC in seven of 18 HD subjects (4 \u00b7 IV, 3 \u00b7 III, 2 \u00b7 IV/CS, 2 \u00b7 I-III, 2 \u00b7 II, 1 \u00b7 I).

Methods: 49 patients with clinically evident tremor diagnosed as PD or ET and 24 age and sex matched healthy volunteers were involved into the study. Tremor intensity was assessed using SDGDT and compared to the visual assessment of spiral drawing during three repetitive measurement sessions. SDGDT allows to calculate the displacement, velocity and acceleration of the tremor vibration in three axis, tremor dominant frequency and two intensity indexes (coefficient of acceleration and computer rating score). Results: Coefficient of acceleration in patients with tremor ranged between 3.3 and 67.2 (mean: 21.7) on the right and between 2.6 and 134.7 (mean: 21.7) on the left hand, and differ significantly as compared with the controls on the right and left hand (P < 0.004; P < 0.001), respectively.

Beta-adrenergic blockers are thought to act by a central mechanism and are still the first choice of treatment. Gabapentine was found to be effective in the treatment of ET as neurochemical changes including GABA mechanisms are also supposed to play a role in ET pathogenesis. Methods: 70 patients with the diagnosis of ET were enrolled in this study and 35 patients got 120 mg propanolol per day and 35 patients got 1200 mg gabapentine per day.

RLS is a leading cause of insomnia. Levodopa therapy is effective in treating RLS. However, patients treated with levodopa may develop morning restlessness. Patients and methods: 20 patients with idiopathic RLS (age 37-63 years), who developed daytime augmentation under levodopa therapy, were enrolled in a 12-week open-label study. Levodopa was down-titrated during the first week, while ropinirole was up-titrated (single bedtime dose) until RLS clearly improved. Efficacy parameters were measured at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 week. Efficacy parameters included: total sleep time, RLS severity score (RLSSS), and disease-related Quality-of-Life (RLSQoL) questionnaire. Results and discussion: Two weeks after the study entry all patients were on ropinirole monotherapy. At the endpoint the dose range of ropinirole was 0.5-1.5 mg at bedtime. RLSSS was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and the total sleep time was prolonged (P < 0.01) compared to baseline. RLSQoL indicated the significant improvement in QoL after ropinirole treatment. Ropinirole was well tolerated. Conclusion: Ropinirole is an effective and safe treatment in RLS especially in patients who developed morning and afternoon restlessness on levodopa therapy. Objective: To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in a large cohort. Background: RLS is the most common movement disorder in the general population (affects 2-5%). Nevertheless it is still a poorly diagnosed condition. Methods: We identified 97 RLS patients (pts) seen in our Movement Disorders Clinic between 1998 and 2003. We analyzed clinical characteristics and treatment-related data. Results: There were 69 women and 28 men. The mean age at onset of RLS (\u00b1SD) was 58.2 \u00b1 13.4 years (range 20-86 years). The mean total duration of RLS was 7.7 years (range 0.2-55 years). 53 cases were idiopathic, 12 cases familial and 32 cases were secondary to other medical conditions. The most frequent drug prescribed to treat RLS in our pts was clonazepam in 54 pts. The response was known in 32 of them and was positive in 30. Pramipexol was given to 32 pts and the response was known in 20. All of them got improved. 33 pts were given levodopa. The response was known in 21 and all of them had a benefit. Codeine Phosphate was given to 13 pts. The response was known in six and five of them had a benefit. Conclusions: RLS is a very common disorder among the elderly and is more frequent in women. More attention has to be paid from primary care physicians for an early diagnosis as the response to various treatments is usually excellent. Progressive neurological deterioration and death follows untreated Wilson disease, while adequate drug treatment of this disease can sustain in patients high quality of life. Basic principles of Wilson disease treatment include copper chelators (penicilamine and trientine), zinc acetate (Galzin) and tetrathiomolibdate. Risk carried out by penicillamine in respect of worsening existing neurological symptomatology, despite its chelating action on copper limites use of this drug. We observed three patients with Wilson disease. In two cases disease manifested by swallowing and articulation difficulties followed by subsequent tremor of extremities combined with stereotypic movements, salivation, extrapyramidal rigidity. Psychiatric manifestation was prominent in the third case. It includes loss of initiative, apathy, depressive symptomatology. Wilson disease was identified by reduced serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper, Kayser-Fleischer rings. MRI in all cases revealed T2 signal hyperintensity in basal ganglia. Considering analogue with hepatic encephalopathy, where hyperammonemia causes deposition of manganese in brain, treatment regime was started with antihyperammoniemic medication. Zinc acetate therapy followed antihyperammoniemic therapy at a dosage 300 mg/day. Neurological improvement was observed in 3 weeks after treatment initiation. Three months later neurological symptomatology reached almost normal baseline status. In patients with psychiatric manifestation treatment regime did not reveal any improvement of clinical symptomatology. It can be supposed that site and size of basal ganglia damage by copper deposits caused preferential development of either neurological or psychiatric symptomatology. Different effect of treatment regime on neurological and psychiatric manifestations of Wilson disease raises the possibility that treatment regime should be enriched by a symptomatic antidepressant therapy. The Parkinsonian syndrome (PS) was induced by systemic injection of the neurotoxine MPTP in C57BL/6 mice, or by intranigral injection of its final metabolite, MPP+ into rats. It was shown that the content of lipid peroxidation (LPO) products in the caudate nuclei of aged rats and mice with MPTP-induced PS and in the blood plasma of patients with Parkinson's disease was also increased. Neurotrophic factors, e.g. basic and acidic fibroblast growth factors, substance P, brain ischemia, glutamate, were also shown to play a role in the mechanisms responsible for the damage of nigrostriatal neurons as well as for the formation and development of PS. Glutamate injected intranigrally in a dose of 10 lg/kg and brain ischemia in aged rats enhance the development of parkinsonian syndromes manifested as oligokinesia and muscle rigidity due to multiple systemic injection of MPTP. Intrastriatal or intranasal injection of substance P to rats with MPTP-induced PS reduced oligokinesia, muscle rigidity and tremor. Fibroblast growth factors and memantine inhibited the development of experimental parkinsonism in rats and mice. The antioxidants dibunol and mexidol decreased the concentration of LPO products in the striatum of PS animals. Combined administration of these antioxidants and L-DOPA made it possible to reduce the dose and enhance the antiparkinsonian effect of the latter.

J. Lobosco, 1 L. Abetz, 1 J. Lian 2 and T. K. Murphy 2 1 Mapi Values, Macclesfield, UK; and 2 Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA Introduction: Prevalence of nocturnal symptoms (NS), including sleep disturbances, in Parkinson's disease patients (PD) ranges from 70 to 90%. The disease process, age, and emotional problems are traditionally linked to NS in PD. However, recent reports suggested that some anti-Parkinson's therapies exacerbate NS and somnolence. Despite this, our understanding of NS's impact on PD lags behind our understanding of daytime symptoms' (including trembling, rigidity/ stiffness, bradykinesia, impaired balance and co-ordination) impact. This review aims to assess the potential impact of NS on the Quality of Life (QoL) of PD and how this relationship is affected by anti-Parkinson's therapies. Methods: PubMed was searched for articles related to NS, PD and QoL (1990+). Results: 39 abstracts were retrieved and reviewed; 36 articles were reviewed. NS have a direct and sizeable effect upon the QoL of PD, with NS potentially leading to a lack of daytime alertness, fatigue, increased depression/moodiness, early retirement and premature institutionalization. Indeed studies show that NS have a greater influence on patients' QoL than motor symptoms. Some suggest that up to a third of all spouses also report NS. In four studies, there appear to be significant differences among anti-Parkinson's therapies' utility in controlling NS and somnolence. Conclusion: This review establishes the significant impact of NS on other QoL domains in PD, suggesting that NS should be considered in selecting PD's therapy. Available daytime symptoms' treatments vary considerably in their effects on NS and somnolence, indicating a need for better understanding of how PD's treatment influences QoL through daytime and night-time symptoms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2273"}, {"text": "Metabolic disorders in Huntington's disease: Impaired insulin secretion is simultaneously present with insulin resistance in normoglycemic patients V.

Mally, L. To\u00b4thfalusi and T. W.

Although, the rTMS therapy has to be repeated regularly to achieve a permanent effect the side effects of long-term administration of low frequency rTMS have not been known. Two different groups of patients with PD were compared in a retrospective study. They were followed for 3 years. First group (A) was treated with drugs, the second group (B) was treated with drugs + rTMS (1 Hz, 0.6 Tesla, 100 stimulus per day with round coil for 7 days). The administration of rTMS was repeated twice or more occasions yearly.

There is often a caudal-rostral progression: the legs are first affected more frequently in children, but only rarely in adult dystonic patients. The earlier the age of onset the more likely it is for the dystonia to generalize. Patients and methods: We examined 20 patients with childhood onset ITD, average age 12.7 years and average age of the disease onset 8.5 years. The average disease duration was 3.9 years. All children had normal psychomotor development and neuroradiological examinations. One of the most important characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the asymmetry of symptoms during the course of the disease. The asymmetry of hypomimia is usually far behind the asymmetric involvement of the extremities. We observed the occurrence of obvious hemihypomimia on the same side of the predominantly affected limbs in some of PD patients. We aimed to investigate the corticobulbar tract function and excitability of the chain of brainstem interneurons using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and recovery of R2 component of the blink reflex. They were performed in 10 of 18 patients. Recordings from nasal muscle were obtained in response to TMS of the face associated motor cortex bilaterally. BR study with single and paired stimulation and recovery of the R2 component were investigated. In all of the patients hypomimia was predominant on the same side with the more severely involved extremities. Interestingly, the right side was more predominantly affected in 17 of 18 patients. There was no asymmetry regarding threshold, latency, amplitude and duration of the motor evoked potentials obtained from TMS. The excitability recovery curve of the BR measured with paired supraorbital nerve stimuli showed early recovery of R2 response on the side where hypomimia is less marked. Hemihypomimia reflecting unilateral hypokinesia of the face can be observed in PD patients rarely. The preponderance of this finding in PD patients with predominantly right-side was an interesting observation. The asymmetric excitability enhancement on the less involved side was an unexpected finding which needs further assessment. When the full sample size has been investigated, conclusion regarding possible short-term effects on motor performance may be drawn and possible correlation between effects and dopaminergic striatal degeneration and possible changes in CBF may be found.

On examination, they all presented with ankle areflexia bilaterally. High CK levels and achanthocytosis was present in all family affected members after 6-h incubation period. MRI showed caudate atrophy and hyperintensity on long TR images in the proband, caudate atrophy in the brother and was normal in the niece. Huntington and Huntington-like disease, McLeod syndrome, Abetalipoproteinaemia and hypobetaproteinaemia have been excluded by genetic and biochemical analysis. There were no significant differences in the severity of action tremor between two groups but the duration of disease in patients with IPTS was shorter and tempo of progression was higher than in patients with CET (P < 0.05). Furthermore patients with IPST frequently had resting tremor, tremor of the jaw, had more severe tandem walking difficulties and postural instability, executive cognitive dysfunction and mood disturbances than patients with CET (r < 0.05). These results suggest IPTS is distinct subtype of ET with more widespread dysfunction of striatofrontal or cerebello-thalamo-frontal pathways. Gait and mood disturbances are common factors influencing quality of life in patients with PD, however their relation remains poorly understood. The aim of the study is to estimate the relationship between mood disturbances and severity of gait disorder in PD. We studied 44 patients with Parkinson disease at the age from 41 to 78 (mean 62.5 \u00b1 9.2 years). Hoehn-Yahr stages varied from 2 to 4 (on average 2.6 \u00b1 0.8). Parkinsonian signs were assessed with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score (part III). We also used Gait and Balance Scale (GABS) by Jankovic et al. (2001) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The GABS score correlated with disease duration, UPDRS III (P < 0.05), more strongly with limb hypokinesia and axial disturbances (P < 0.001); however, there was no correlation between age, resting tremor or rigidity. 18 patients (53%) had depression according to cut-off BDI point of 13/14. Severity of depression did not depend on age, Hoehn-Yahr stage, UPDRS III or disease duration. There were no differences on GABS total score and Tinetti modified scale score in depressive and non-depressive patients. However depressive patients had more reduced stride length compared to non-depressive ones. We found a correlation between points of BDI assessed apathy (but not melancholy) and GABS total score (r = 0.5, P < 0.05), freezing (r = 0.6, P < 0.01), Tinetti modified scale score (r = 0.6, P < 0.005), reduction of stride length (r = 0.5, P < 0.05). These results may be explained by different pathophysiological mechanisms of apathy and other mood disturbances. We proposed apathy and gait disorder have common underlying mechanisms may be associated with disrupting of noradrenergic pathways. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of pramipexole on motor complications in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) over 1-year treatment. 38 patients (mean age 59.9 \u00b1 7.9 years) experiencing motor fluctuations were included. 26 patients reported also L-DOPAinduced diskynesias. The effect of pramipexole was evaluated every 3 months using UPDRS and Rating scale for assessing the severity of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia (BSF). Pramipexole treatment led to reduction of 'off' periods by 26.8%, resulting in an additional 1.9 h of 'on' period per day (P < 0.01). The average severity of the 'off' periods decreased by 25% (P < 0.01). Pramipexole produced 40% improvement on the 'off' time dystonia (P < 0.01). The frequency and severity of unpredictable 'off' symptoms (P < 0.05) and freezing (P < 0.05) were reduced only in the first 6 months and then returned to previous level. In the first 6 months pramipexole decreased the severity of dyskinesia of 'on' periods (P < 0.05) by 28% (mainly due to 11.2% reduction in dose of levodopa). As at the end of the study dose of levodopa returned to baseline level, and dyskinesia 'on' periods worsened. There was no effect on diphasic dyskinesia. The effect of pramipexole on motor fluctuation and dyskinesia positively correlated with level of motor improvement, and negatively correlated with Hoehn & Yahr stage, duration of illness and levodopa treatment (P < 0.05).

There was no increase of Tmuscle and EMG activity during harmaline-induced Tibat/Trec increases. However, when body temperature of such animals was lowered by cooling pad, they began to shiver and the EMG activity increased. These results may suggest that harmalineinduced body temperature changes in urethane-anesthetized rats are results of the balance between heat production and heat dissipation, and that the former was caused by enhanced activity of the central sympathetic nervous system.

We sought to evaluate changes in cognitive dysfunction in patients with very active multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with mitoxantrone. Methods: 15 consecutive MS patients with very active relapsing-remitting MS were included. Very active MS was defined as a progression of at least one EDSS point or more than three relapses during the previous year and at least one enhanced lesion after gadolinium infusion on MRI. All patients were treated with mitoxantrone for 6 months. Global cognitive efficiency, memory and executive function tests were performed at baseline (M0), at 6 months (M6) and at 12 months (M12) of the treatment. To evaluate the learning effect, 15 healthy subjects were also tested. Results: One patient did not complete the evaluation at M6, and another was excluded because of a too low score at the verbal intelligence scale. In the remaining 13 patients we found a significant improvement at M6 in global cognitive efficiency (P = 0.01), executive functions through the Gonogo test (P = 0.008) and the crossed taping (P = 0.0008). These results were sustained at M12 notably in global cognitive efficiency (P < 0.01), in the delayed recall of Grober and Buschke test (P = 0.004), phonemic fluency (P = 0.002) and executive functions in the Stroop test (P = 0.01). Conclusion: Our study suggests that mitoxantrone has a positive effect on cognitive function especially on global efficiency, episodic memory and executive functions. Further studies will be needed to evaluate the long-term impact of mitoxantrone on cognitive decline in MS. Methods: A total of 158 healthy control subjects [CG, mean age: 36.9 (SD = 10.9) years] and 80 MS patients [mean age: 39.2 (11.3) years] were tested with an extensive neuropsychological test battery and MUSIC. MUSIC consists of five subtests: word list A with free recall in two trials/interference word list B/verbal fluency task/interference task (Stoop paradigm)/delayed recall of list A. It also contains a fatigue questionnaire. On the basis of discriminant analyses raw scores were weighted, and CG data (mean scores and standard deviations) were used to define transformation of raw scores, cut offs for impairment and score ranges for different severities of dysfunction. Results: A maximum transformed score of 30 was defined for MUSIC. Scores of 20-30 points indicate age adequate performance: 16-19 points, mild; 11-15, moderate; and 10 or less, severe cognitive dysfunction. Mean MUSIC scores were 24.3 (SD = 3.2) in the CG and 15.9 (SD = 2.4, P < .001) in MS patients. Conclusion: MUSIC is an economical tool to detect cognitive impairment in MS patients. It is easy to administer and well accepted by patients. Cognitive function can be classified as being age-adequate or mildly, moderately or severely impaired. Methods and patients: Eight MS patients were included in the study. All the patients previously underwent conventional treatment. The transplantations were performed in accordance with EBMT protocols. The data were analyzed at baseline, at discharge, and at 3, 6, 8, 12 months and later every half-a-year after ASCT. The median follow-up duration was 24 months. Results: Clinically seven patients were stable or improved. MRI revealed no new lesions in four patients and decrease of lesions number in two patients. In one patient disease progression was registered 1.5 years after ASCT. Comparison of EDSS before ASCT and at follow-up revealed its decrease in six patients; in one patient it remained the same and in the patient with disease progression EDSS increased (from 6.5 to 7.0). Distinct QoL improvement was observed in all the patients with disease stabilization at the end of follow-up. Conclusion: HDT + ASCT in MS patients resulted in disease stabilization and improvement of neurological and health status in seven of eight patients during the follow-up. We consider that restoration of lost neurological functions might be explained by plasticity of stem cells, which penetrate in spinal cord and brain tissue through blood-brain barrier. This hypothesis should be confirmed in further studies. Edg receptors are a family of G-coupled protein receptors, which endogenous ligands are lysophospholipid mediators, sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) or lysophosphatidic acid. Edg8 (S1P 5), the last identified Edg receptor is a high-affinity S1P receptor, expressed in central nervous system white matter. Here we show, on tissue sections from post-natal murine brains and on oligodendroglial cell cultures that Edg8 mRNAs and proteins are restricted to oligodendroglial cells in the central nervous system, and are expressed from the oligodendrocyte precursor stage to the mature myelinating cell. On mature oligodendrocytes, S1P activation promoted survival, via a pertussis toxin sensitive Akt pathway. In contrast, on immature oligodendrocytes, no survival effect was evidenced but Edg8 activation induced oligodendroglial processes retraction via a Rho-kinase/CRMP-2 signaling. This effect was not detected on cells from Edg8 deficient mouse brain.

A retrospective analysis R. J. Mills, 1 T. E. Nixon, 2 and C. A. Young 1 1 Department of Neurology; and 2 Department of Neuroradiology, Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Liverpool, UK Objective: To determine the frequency of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in the hypothalamus as detected by routine, diagnostic, MS protocol MRI. Background: A post mortem study of a series of unselected MS patients revealed a remarkably high (95%) prevalence of lesions in the hypothalamus. However, apart from a few case reports, imaging abnormality in the hypothalamus of MS patients is relatively uncommon. This clearly is a paradox; the present study aims to quantify the frequency of MR detectable hypothalamic lesions, from scans using standard MS protocol sequences, since no such figure exists in the current literature. Method: Scans from 67 consecutive patients with clinically definite MS with compatible MR abnormalities, were viewed by an experienced neuroradiologist for the presence of hypothalamic plaques. MR protocol: proton density and T2, 5 mm axial; 1.5T machine. The number of plaques, if any, was recorded. Results: All scans contained white matter lesions outside the hypothalamus, compatible with MS. An hypothalamic abnormality was detected in three of the 67 patients (i.e. 4 5%) and in each case this consisted of a single plaque. Conclusion: There is a mismatch between the frequencies of lesions detected in the hypothalamus at post mortem, 95% versus 4.5% in vivo, as detected by MR scanning. The hypothalamus plays an important role in the immune system and the immunomodulation of MS; a greater understanding of this process in vivo may be afforded by improving the imaging of this deep brain structure. Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a highly variable course and prognosis. Only few patients have a benign course of the disease, defined as minimal or no disability, equivalent to a score on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 3.0, at least 10 years after disease onset. This definition is, however, heavily weighted toward physical disability and does not account of other important features such as fatigue, pain, depression and cognitive dysfunction that only have minor impact on the EDSS. Recent studies show that the course of benign MS may only be temporary. Many patients show disease progression beyond EDSS 3.0 during follow-up of 20-30 years. We used the quality of life (QoL) questionnaire SF-36 to study other aspects of the disease in addition to physical disability. The SF-36 scores were compared in patients with benign and non-benign MS and a normal population. All patients with onset of MS during 1976-1986 in Hordaland County, Western Norway were included. In 1995 about 40% fulfilled the criteria for benign MS, but 25% of these had been awarded disability pension. SF-36 indicated that patients with benign MS had a better QoL than patients with a non-benign course. Both groups, however, had significantly reduced QoL compared to a normal population. Conclusion: Patients with benign MS have significantly reduced QoL compared with a normal population. Fatigue, pain, depression, and cognitive dysfunction in addition to physical disability should be taken into consideration with regards to the definition benign MS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2308"}, {"text": "Cytokine producing T cells in peripheral blood of remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis patients.

Orefice Department of Neurological Sciences, Federico II University, Napoli, Italy Three interferons (IFN) and Copaxone have been licensed as disease modifying therapies (DMT) for relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. In clinical practice, some patients switch from one DMT to another. We studied the outcome of a group switching from one drug to another for disease activity and decreased compliance. We enrolled 540 DMTtreated patients from 1997 to 2003. Disease activity was defined as perceived lack of efficacy. Decreased compliance was due to side effects and voluntary decision. Avonex and Rebif 22 were defined as low-dose IFN; Betaferon and Rebif 44 as high-dose IFN. A total of 110 patients (20.4%) switched DMT, after 24 \u00b1 17 months (range: 1-109). 59 (53.6%) patients changed DMT (usually shifting to a low-dose IFN or Copaxone) after 22.7 \u00b1 16.1 (1-62) months, due to decreased compliance. 51 (46.4%) patients switched to other DMT (usually a high-dose IFN) after 25.6 \u00b1 18.6 months, due to disease activity. After switching therapy, 70% of the patients (67% in the disease activity group, and 73% in the decreased compliance group) did not stop the new therapy, after 18.1 \u00b1 13.7 months, whereas 30% interrupted the therapy, or switched again DMT, after 15.8 \u00b1 11 months. These results suggest that switching DMT may be considered a therapeutic opportunity (i) in patients with disease activity and perceived lack of DMT efficacy, in which a period with high-dose IFN therapy may be useful; and (ii) in patients with decreasing compliance or remarkable side effects, in which a period with low-dose IFN therapy may be useful. 48 (0-3) . The patients were divided into two groups. Group I (12 cases) consisted of those having periventricular and pons plaque, whereas Group II (13 cases) consisted of those having only periventricular plaque. All patients who had spinal cord plaque excluded. Urodynamic evaluation was done. Results: Comparing the plaque localization and the urodynamic results did not reveal any statistical difference between the groups (P = 0.841). The symptoms observed in the groups were studied with respect to their relation with the urodynamic findings. All the symptomatic cases in Group I and half of the symptomatic cases in Group II had abnormal urodynamic findings. Among the asymptomatic cases, 71.4% of Group I and 40% of Group II had normal urodynamic findings. Conclusion: As a result, existence of pontine plaque in those having periventricular plaque does not affect the urologic symptoms and urodynamic functions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a frequent demyelinating disease, and no epidemiological study about MS has been done in South Morocco. To study the profile of MS in South Morocco, authors retrospectively analyzed 78 observations collected during 10 years. Females were more represented than males (67%), ages between 36 and 40 years were widely found. Low socioeconomical level was found in 73.5% of these cases and 72% came from urban areas and 59% were illiterate. The delay of consultation varied between 1 and 5 years. The inaugural symptoms were pyramidal (53%), than optic neuritis (25.5%). The relapsing remitting form prevailed with 43%, and the diagnosis was established clinically in 65%. The CSF was studied in 82% of the cases, oligoclonale hypergammaglobulinorrachy was found in 90%. CT Scan was carried out in 50%, and MRI in the third. The socio-economical reasons and the low social security cover (>30%) explain these low number of MRI. The evoked potentials were realized in 45%, in which 96% were abnormal. In all these patients, 74% received methyl prednisolone, relayed by oral corticotherapy. Five patients only received interferon, for the same economic reasons. After 5 years of follow up, the outcome was favorable in 25%, whereas 27% worsened, the others were stabilized.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) of unknown etiopathogenesis showing a particularly elevated frequency in the innermost part of Sicily. Hypercholesterolemia (HC) is common in Sicily, affecting approximately 17% of males and 25% of females. HC as well as the breakdown products of cholesterol can contribute to autoimmune demyelination by causing a chronic inflammatory state characterized by endothelial cell injury, increased endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte infiltration of both large and microvascular vessel wall and increased rolling, adhesion and leukocyte migration across the blood brain barrier. Not surprisingly, statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs) show an anti-inflammatory activity and have been proposed as treatment for MS. To preliminarily assess the relationship between cholesterol and MS, we measured cholesterol plasma levels in a prospective cohort of 250 Sicilian patients affected by relapsing-remitting (66%), secondary progressive (24%) or primary progressive (10%) MS and correlated them with age, sex, age at onset, disease duration, clinical course, presence of relapses at time of evaluation, disability (EDSS) and index of body mass. Preliminary data show a slightly higher frequency of HC (>240 mg/dl) among MS patients compared to reported values referred to local general population (male: 21.5% vs. 18%; female: 27.5% vs. 23%). Mean cholesterol levels were also higher among MS patients compared to reported levels of the local general population (males: 206 mg/dl vs. 202 mg/dl; females: 205 mg/dl vs. 203 mg/dl). All other analysis are still ongoing, our preliminary data support the notion that HC can affect the development of demyelination diseases of the CNS. Aphasia is an uncommon manifestation of MS, occurring in up to 1% of patients. We report on five patients presenting aphasia during a relapse. Common symptoms for all patients were sudden onset speech impairment and mild right hemiparesis. Neurological examination and specific evaluation of spontaneous speech, comprehension, repetition, naming, reading and writing, were performed. All patients had nonfluent aphasia with anomia, paraphasias and difficulty in writing while comprehension was normal. The possibility of acute ischaemic attack or epileptiform activity, was excluded. The brain MRI and CSF protein immunoelectrophoresis were compatible with MS. Patients were administered with corticosteroid treatment, 1 g methylprednisolone intravenously for five consecutive days followed by an oral taper dose for 15-30 days. All but one patients regained normal speech with fluent expression and writing during six months follow-up. In one patient, considered to have a progressive course of MS, residual paraphasias or difficulty in word finding were still obvious within the same period of time.

The primary amino acid structure of OTMP predicts an integral membrane protein with intracellular termini characteristic of a receptor protein with signaling potential. Fluorescent activated cell sorting experiments indicate that OTMP is co-expressed on a subpopulation of A2B5 positive oligodendrocyte progenitors and is not expressed at more differentiated stages.

Brain MRI were performed in all of the patients. No drugs were administered during the examinations. Ten of the patients were unable to complete the test. These patients suffered from the progressive type of the disease and performed an EDSS score of 5-6 and MMS score less than 25. Brain MRI showed diffuse demyelination, cortical atrophy and enlargement of lateral ventricles. Five patients show profile within normal limits, using MMPI, with an EDSS score less than 3 and normal MMS score. The rest of the patients suffered from the relapsing-remitting type of the disease, with a mean EDSS score up to 4, normal findings in MMS and without brain atrophy in brain MRI. These patients show depression (scale 2), hypochondriasis (scale 1) and hysteria (scale 3) according to MMPI examination. The individuals show a prominent concern about physical integrity and the presence of a large number of somatic complaints was suggested. A tendency toward somatization during periods of stress was suggested.

Objective: The aim of the study was the evaluation of cognitive, speech and language impairment in patients with MS in relation to the degree of disability and type of MS, as well as the degree of depression and fatigue. Method: A total of 30 individuals were studied (n = 30), nine with primary progressive type of MS, 11 with relapsingremitting and 10 with secondary progressive type of the disorder. 16 of them had a degree of disability, as measured with the EDSS scale, >6.5 and 11 had an EDSS score <4.5.

Brain MRI using T2-weighted sequence was performed and supratentorial TLL was calculated (mm 3 ). As a statistical tool, multivariate analysis (MANOVA) was used. Cognitive test scores and TLL were analyzed using canonical correlation. On the majority of cognitive scores, the rrMS group showed significantly worse scores than the control group. No significance was found on: Verbal pairs immediate, Digit span, Visual Span Forward test and on the first memory trial (3 min ROCF recall). Canonical correlation revealed strong relationship between WMS scores [delayed recall of verbal associative pairs (P = 0.009) and visual reproduction-delayed (P = 0.012)]. ROCF scores did not correlate with TLL. Statistically significant correlation between RAVLT with TLL was found [for the second trial recall of A word list (P = 0.01), number of perseverations in B list (P = 0.04) and number of confabulations in delayed recall of A list (P = 0.025)].

The immunogenicity of beta IFNs among Iranian patients under treatment has not yet been determined. In this study, for the first time in Iran, the level of binding anti IFN-beta was compared in patients receiving IFN-beta 1a (Avonex, Biogen) with patients treated with IFN-beta 1b (Betaferon, Berlex). Methods: Blood sera were obtained from 60 patients treated with Avonex and 18 patients treated with Betaferon. Antibodies binding to IFN-beta were measured using ELISA. Results: Binding antibodies (Babs) developed in 22 of 60 patients (36%) receiving Avonex, whereas of 18 patients treated with Betaferon 12 (67%) became Bab positive. No correlation was found between relapse rates and positive Bab. Conclusion: This is a preliminary report of an ongoing study. Our results show that Betaferon is more immunogenic than Avonex among Iranian MS patients and this is compatible with prior studies in other countries. Since the effects of IFN-beta on MS disease activity and progression are partial, large sample sizes are required to demonstrate clinical correlates of binding antibodies. Also further study is needed to detect Neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) in Bab positive patients. Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes localized demyelination in the central nervous system. Myelin basic protein (MBP) is the major protein component of myelin, and the concentration of MBP or its fragment in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) correlates closely with the clinical activity of MS and other diseases in which there is myelin breakdown. We used a sensitive and specific ELISA method for MBP and measured MBP in CSF from 23 patients with MS and 23 other neurological diseases. All CSF samples were obtained by lumbar puncture and were stored at -80\u00b0C until assayed. The ELISA is an enzymatically amplified two-step sandwich-type immunoassay. In the assay, standards, controls and CSF samples are incubated in microtritation wells, which have been coated with anti-human MBP antibody. After incubation and washing, the wells are treated with another antihuman MBP detection antibody labeled with the enzyme horseradish peroxidase. After a second incubation and washing step, the wells are incubated with the substrate tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). An acid stopping solution is then added and the degree of enzymatic turnover of the substrate is determined by dual wavelength absorbance measurement at 450 and 620 nm. The absorbance measured is directly proportional to the concentration of MBP present. The mean CSF MBP concentration in the patients with other neurological diseases was 0.34 ng/ml. The mean CSF MBP concentration in the MS patients was 0.38 ng/ml.

Introduction: Pharmacoresistance of epilepsy in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been associated with severe disability, usually in a late stage of the disease. Our study analyses the prognostic value of AED resistance at onset in MS patients for the outcome of disability. Methods: We retrospectively studied 23 patients with definite MS and epilepsy. In this series, 17 patients received AED therapy. Pharmacoresistance was determined on the basis of the failure on appropriate treatment with the initially prescribed drug (first grade of resistance, Perucca criteria, 1996) . At the onset of pharmacoresistance and at the end of followup, at least 1 year, neurological impairment was established according to Kurtzke's scale (EDSS): mild or absent disability (EDSS: 0-3.5), moderate (EDSS: 4-6) and severe (EDSS: 6.5-9.5). The transitions, always in aggravation, from one level of disability to another for each patient were determined. Results: Ten patients were pharmacoresistant (group A) and seven (group B) were seizure-free with the initially prescribed drug. In group A, at the end of follow-up (5 \u00b1 3 years), the mean value of transitions of disability level was 0.9 \u00b1 0.6; in group B, at the end of follow-up (8 \u00b1 8 years), the mean value of transitions of disability level was 0.6 \u00b1 0.2. Conclusions: In our MS epileptic patients the AED resistance at onset seems associated with a greater mean value of transitions of disability level, indicating a less favorable outcome of disability.

MS was defined by McDonald criteria (2001), controls were selected from a pool of blood donors. Screening for MOG gene polymorphism G511C (Val142Leu) and for CD45 gene polymorphisms C77G (Pro57Pro) and A138G (Thr191Ala) was performed as described (Gomez-Lira et al., J Neuroimmunol 111: 245-247, 2000, and 140: 216-221, 2003) . Preliminary results showed no association of MS with the two CD45 polymorphisms under study. There was a similar MOG G511C allelic frequency in cases and controls, with both groups having low proportions of CC (around 3%) and a high proportion of GG (67%) form. We found a highly significant increased frequency of HLA-DRB1*1501 in MS cases compared to controls. We since analyzed MOG polymorphisms after stratifying subjects by this haplotype: in positive individuals CC frequency was higher in controls (12%) than in cases (2%) (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.13-2.3), suggesting a possible tendency toward a protective effect. Introduction: The visual pathway is a frequently involved system in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). In RRMS patients the visual evoked potentials (VEP) latency prolongation is considered as evidence of demyelination in the visual pathway, clinically evident as visual dysfunction, including optic neuritis (ON). In patients with no visual disturbance, the delayed VEP are associated with the so-called clinically silent demyelinating lesions. Methods: In a prospective study VEP were studied in nine patients (18 eyes) with RRMS treated with interferon (IFN) beta-1a. Three of them have had an episode of unilateral ON. VEP were first recorded before treatment and then followed up for 12 months, at 3-month intervals, in the time when patients were receiving IFN beta-1a subcutaneously, 22 lg twice weekly. P100 latencies and P100 amplitudes were evaluated. Results: Before IFN beta-1a treatment P100 latency was delayed in three eyes (16.7%) of three patients with a history of ON. After 12 months of treatment, for a group of 18 eyes, there was no statistically significant difference in P100 latencies and P100 amplitudes. At follow-up P100 remained delayed in three eyes with a history of ON. Further, in three eyes of two patients with normal P100 latency before treatment, P100 became delayed. Overall, at follow-up P100 was delayed in six eyes (33%) of five patients. Conclusion: IFN beta-1a low-dose regime was not sufficient to normalize VEP. However, VEP revealed electrophysiological evidence of clinically asymptomatic demyelinating lesions, which may progress into clinically manifested functional deterioration, including ON.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 119, "end": 120, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 690, "end": 748, "text": "(Gomez-Lira et al., J Neuroimmunol 111: 245-247, 2000, and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 749, "end": 768, "text": "140: 216-221, 2003)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2328"}, {"text": "Differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis with other neurologic diseases in children V.

In 31 children (19 girls and 12 boys) it was diagnosed clinically true MS. The age of debut was 4-15 years, the peak of age constituting 12-13 years. The first symptoms in eight children (26%) appeared prior to the age of 10. The earliest start was noted in a 4-year-old girl. A monosymptomic start prevailed in 21 children (68%), a polysymptomic start in 10 (32%). The initial symptoms were retrobulbar neuritis of the optic nerve, ataxia, insulated disturbance of sensitivity, facial nerve neuropathy, diskinesia. In 25 cases was diagnosed clinically probable MS. In 35 children MS was excluded and other neurological diseases were diagnosed: tumors of brain and spinal cord (10), inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (7), subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (5), leukodystrophy (4), olivopontocerebellar degeneration (2), neurofibromatosis with spinal cord compression (1), Shtrumpel's disease (1), Hallervorden-Shpatz's disease (1), Shilder's disease (1), spinal stroke (1), Louis-Bar syndrome (1), MELAS (1) . It was noted the significant meaning of the computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the differential diagnosis of MS. Genotyping in the field of HLA DRB1*(15) and genes of cytokines IL-1beta, IL-1Ra, IL-6 has been carried out among Russians in the groups with multiple sclerosis (MS) (n = 80) and healthy people in Western Siberia (n = 114). The accumulation effect of locus 15 of gene DRB2 (P = 0.003) has been found out. Association between the length of appearance of clinical manifestations of the disease, increase rate of neurological disability, sex and bearing of HLA DRB1*(15) gene has not been revealed. Differences on occurrence rate on T allele (P = 0.036) and C/C genotype in exon 5 of IL-1beta gene (P = 0.025) were revealed between the groups of patients with MS and healthy. Differences on occurrence rate on polymorphous C-174G locus in a promoter area of IL-6 gene and VNTR intron 2 of IL-1Ra gene were not revealed in the groups of patients with MS and healthy. Homozygotes careers on T allele of IL-1beta gene and allele 2 of IL-1Ra gene with MS had more rapid disability development. C/CIL-1b and 4R/4RIL-1Ra genes act as protectors. Dependence of length of MS clinical manifestations, sex differences on gene polymorphism of cytokines were not obtained. Periodic paralyses are muscle disorders characterized by episodic attacks of weakness. They are usually classified according to the variation of the blood potassium levels during the attacks into hypokalemic (hypoPP) and hyperkalemic (hyperPP) periodic paralysis. These two disorders are caused by distinct mutations within the voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN4A. However, mutations in the voltage-gated calcium channel gene CACN1AS are also associated with hypoPP. We studied four families presenting acute attacks of paralysis. Detailed clinical and neurophysiological examination was performed in each case. Molecular genetic analysis of SCN4A was performed with a combination of D-HPLC and direct DNA sequencing. We have found three new mutations in SCN4A affecting the same codon. The affected family members presented features reminiscent of hyperPP but some cases displayed an unusual mixture of clinical symptoms of hyperPP and, in particular circumstances, of hypoPP. Our findings suggest the existence of a combined hyperPP-hypoPP phenotype, not previously described in periodic paralysis, associated with new mutations of the SCN4A gene. Background: Massive cell death, a main limitation of myoblast transfer therapy, could reflect transplanted myogenic precursor cells (MPC) impediment to orchestrate the setting up of their stromal support. Indeed, we have shown that MPC initiate a process aimed at providing an adequate stromal support to their growth (J Cell Biol, 163:1133 -1143 . MPC first initiate monocyte recruitment and interplay with macrophages to amplify chemotaxis. Then, macrophages act as potent supportive cells for MPC through delivery of both soluble mitogenic factors and cell contact-mediated survival signals. Other cell types, including erythroblasts, astrocytes and neurons, may be rescued by macrophages through VLA-4:VCAM-1 or Fractalkine:CX3CR1 interactions. MPC might use these molecules to bind macrophages and then receive antiapoptotic signals. Methods: We used human MPC and human monocytederived macrophages, in direct cocultures at various ratio. Apoptosis was evaluated in vitro by annexin-V labelling and DiOC6(3) uptake analyzed by cytofluometry, and by caspase 3 specific activity measurements. Disorders of mitochondrial fatty acid \u00df-oxidation are better known and recognized in their severe infantile presentation. We report five adults affected with either very long chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD) or multiple acylcoenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. The patients with VLCAD presented with severe exercise-induced muscle pain and rhabdomyolysis, two of them with overt myoglobinuria episodes. The two patients with MCAD presented with exercise intolerance and rhabdomyolysis but no myoglobinuria. One of these patients had permanent weakness of limb girdle muscles. Delay of the diagnosis after onset of symptoms was very long. Muscle biopsy showed lipid storage in all the patients. Carnitine levels in blood were analysed in four patients and were in the normal range. Chromatographic analysis of urinary organic acids was performed in only three patients. It was normal in one patient and showed dicarboxylic aciduria or/and increase of glycine derivatives in two patients. Analysis of utilization of fatty acids was performed in three patients and was constantly abnormal. The diagnosis was made on the presence of abnormal profile of acylcarnitines in blood. It was confirmed by the measurement of the enzymatic activities in fibroblasts or leukocytes. Defects of fatty acid oxidation may be under-recognized due to the quite recent availability of the analysis of blood acylcarnitine profiles. They must be considered in patients with severe exercise intolerance with or without overt myoglobinuria. This diagnosis is particularly important to make in respect to the significant clinical improvement brought by dietetic education associated with carnitine and/or triheptanoin supplementation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1348, "end": 1351, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 4116, "end": 4138, "text": "(J Cell Biol, 163:1133", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4139, "end": 4144, "text": "-1143", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2331"}, {"text": "Polymyositis and myasthenia gravis. Report of four cases C. E. Delpirou-Nouh, 1 Objective: To describe four cases of polymyositis (PM) associated with myasthenia gravis (MG). Background: PM and MG are autoimmune disorders which are rarely associated. Isolated cases have been reported. Material and methods: From PM and MG files, we searched patients who presented with both diseases. Clinical, biological and pathological data were reviewed. Results: Four cases were found. Three patients were male and one female, aged from 43 to 57 years. PM was the first event in three cases and was followed by MG from 2 to 16 years later. MG was the revealing disease in one case and PM occurred 3 years after MG. Muscle biopsy revealed giant cell myositis in two patients, but none of the patients had symptoms of myocarditis. In three cases, CT scan showed a thymoma, which was successfully removed. Both PM and MG improved after thymectomy, corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatments. Discussion: About 30 cases of PM-MG are reported in the literature and most of them are associated with a thymoma. Giant cells are frequently found in muscle biopsy and seem to be associated with a bad prognosis due to a high risk of intractable arythmias and sudden death related with myocarditis. Thymoma probably play a role in the occurrence of successive and multiple autoimmune diseases. HLA B8 and HLA DR3 are associated with PM and MG so that a genetic predisposition to develop both disorders is likely. Conclusion: PM is rarely associated with MG. In such patients, thymomas must be systematically searched. Background: AChR deficiency syndrome is a recessive, congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) characterized by reduced or absent AChR expression, and caused mainly by mutations in the AChR epsilon subunit. It is thought that the fetal form of the receptor, in which the gamma subunit substitutes for the epsilon subunit, can partially rescue AChR function. The delta subunit appears to control assembly of the receptor and may also partially determine AChR expression. Object and methods: We asked if polymorphisms in the gamma or delta subunit promoters were related to phenotypic variability in AChR deficiency patients. We analysed a common polymorphism in the N-box of the delta subunit and the promoter of AChR gamma subunit (1000 bp before the translation starting site). For analysis, the 30 patients with null AChR epsilon mutations were divided into mild, moderate (typical) and severe phenotypes. Results: 52% of patients were heterozygous for the delta N-box polymorphism and 41% were homozygous. Two new polymorphisms were identified in the gamma promoter, frequently associated on the same allele, 164 (G$\\reg$C) and a duplication of 7 bp at position )105 (GGGCTGGCT). 31% of patients were heterozygous and 8% were homozygous. The frequencies of these polymorphisms were not statistically different in patients with mild, moderate or severe phenotype. Conclusions: The presence of polymorphisms in the gamma promoter or the N-box of the delta promoter do not appear to correlate with the severity of clinical phenotype in a large group of patients with AChR deficiency.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 78, "end": 79, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2347"}, {"text": "The comparison of the effect of thymectomy in seropositive and seronegative myasthenia gravis D.

In the seropositive patients (SPMG) there was clear predominance of females (4:1), while in the seronegative (SNMG) group this predominance was twice less prominent (1.8:1) . The duration of the disease before thymectomy for both groups of patients was similar ranging from 0.5 to 48 months (mean, 13.4). The age at onset was slightly higher in SNMG patients, but the difference was not statistically significant (P < 0.01) and varied from 10 to 58 years (mean, 32.0) in SPMG and from 14-54 years (mean, 35.6) in SNMG. According to the Ossermans' classification, ocular MG was found in 2% of SPMG and 4% of SNMG patients, IIA MG in 30% of SPMG and 40% of SNMG and IIB MG in 67% of SPMG and 56% of SNMG. Two SPMG patients presented as an acute fulminant MG (2%). The difference in distribution of different clinical forms between SPMG and SNMG was not statistically significant (P < 0.01). Thymoma was found in 17 SPMG patients (16.2%) and in 2 SNMG patients (8%). In the group of patients with SPMG 38 patients (36.2%) were in remission, 40 patients significantly improved (38.1%), 18 (17.1%) did not change and nine patients (8.6%) deteriorated. In SNMG group 10 patients were in remission (40%), 4 patients significantly improved (16%), five (20%) had unchanged condition and six (24%) patients deteriorated. Altogether, good therapeutic response to thymectomy was observed in 74.3% of SPMG and 56% of SNMG patients. From the prognostic point of view thymectomy was significantly more effective in patients with SPMG. . The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of associated diseases in all 674 incident cases, and to analyze the distribution of these diseases within SPMG and SNMG patients. Associated diseases were found in 48.1% of patients, with the similar gender distribution. The most frequently associated disease was hypertension (12.2%), significantly more frequent in men than in women (18.5 and 8.7%, respectively P < 0.01), but not exceeding the prevalence in general population. MG was associated with other autoimmune diseases in 223 patients (33.1%). Among them the most frequent disorder was thyroid gland dysfunction (7.0%), significantly more frequent in women than in men (8.7 and 3.8%, respectively P < 0.05). The allergies were also significantly associated with MG (5.6%) as well as diabetes (5.5%, more frequently in men than in women; 9.7% and 3.2%, respectively P < 0.05), benign (3.9%) and malignant tumors (3.7%). The association with other diseases did not correlate with the severity of MG. The other autoimmune diseases were present in 59 (30.9%) SPMG and 20 (40.0%) SNMG patients (P > 0.05). All associated diseases were uniformly distributed among seropositive and seronegative patients, except diabetes, which was more frequent in seropositive patients. The investigation of the occurrence of other disorders in the family members of the observed patients indicated the malignant tumors as the most frequent disease (18.3%). Our results suggested that association of MG with other autoimmune disorders is not a random phenomenon but rather a consequence of the immune system dysfunction, both in SPMG and SNMG. We describe three cases of axial myopathy, two presenting with a typical bent spine syndrome, the third associated with hyperlordosis. The patients were all elderly women, only one with a family history of a similar myopathy. In all patients, neurological examination demonstrated severe weakness confined to paraspinal muscles and EMG showed a myopathic pattern. In two cases serum CK was slightly increased. CT scans of the paraspinal and limb girdle muscles, performed with muscle density measurements at several vertebral levels and at the shoulder and pelvic girdle, showed a marked hypotrophy and hypodensity limited to the paraspinal muscles. Muscle biopsy of the quadriceps muscle showed myopathic findings with a loss of N-dystrophin. Electron microscopy revealed Z disc streaming and, in one case, dilation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and anomalies in mitochondrial morphology. These three cases show similar EMG, CT and morphological features. The hyperlordosis seen in one of our patients may be due to a compensation phenomenon of neck kyphosis, subsequently accentuated by the onset of paraspinal myopathy. The etiopathogenesis of axial myopathy is still unknown and is possibly multifactorial given that only some reported cases, in analogy to one of our own, show a familial pattern. Our findings suggest that this syndrome may be due to a defect of dystrophin expression although a normal expression has been reported (Mahjneh et al., 2002) .

Lafuste, C. Sonnet, B. Chazaud, R. K. Gherardi and F. J. Authier INSERM 0011, Faculte de Medecine, Ho\u02c6pital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France Skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated cells formed through proliferation, aggregation and fusion of mononucleated MPC. The molecular events implicated in the crucial step of MPC fusion remain poorly understood. A member of ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family, ADAM12, was involved in MPC fusion, in both murine myogenesis and in myotube-like differentiation of human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. More, it was shown that ADAM12 requires involvement of an additional partner to launch MPC membrane fusion. We hypothesize that human myogenesis could require involvement of a multimolecular system in which ADAM-12 could interact with alpha-9-beta-1 integrin to mediate MPC fusion. We used primary cultures of human MPC at three stages of differentiation: proliferating, fusing MPC and myotubes. Proliferation and differentiation were evaluated by measurement of cell count and fusion index. Expressions of ADAM12, alpha-9 and beta-1 were assessed by RT-PCR, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Involvement of ADAM12/alpha-9-beta-1 integrin partnership in MPC fusion was evaluated by inhibition procedures using antisense strategies and blocking antibody. ADAM12, alpha-9 and beta-1 were expressed by MPC at each stages of differentiation. Immunoblotting showed that alpha-9 expression paralleled that of ADAM12, with a maximum just before MPC entered fusion process. Immunofluorescence study disclosed colocalization of both molecules at intercellular contact spots. Anti-ADAM12 antisense or anti-alpha-9 blocking antibody induced decrease of MPC fusion by 46%, combination of both increasing inhibition rate up to 64%. ADAM12 is constitutively expressed during human MPC differentiation, in association with that of alpha-9-beta-1 integrin.

The mean age was 41 years (range 26-73 years). The mean duration of MG was 7.5 years (range 1-19 years). Eight patients have undergone thymectomy. All patients with refractory MG were receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors together with immunosuppressive therapy in the past (prednisone, methylprednisolone, azathioprine, cyclosporin A, cyclophosphamide, IVIG, methotrexate, plasma exchange, immunoadsorption) without therapeutic response or patients taking only corticosteroids and requiring additional immunosuppression.

Conclusions: Our study has evidence suggesting that mycophenolate mofetil may be a useful and safe medication for treating patients with MG. (163) were cured with the combination of AHE drugs, thymectomy and corticosteroids. The therapeutic strategies for the last 25 years were: make the correct diagnosis as early as possible and introduce AHE drugs to make the patient comfortable; perform the thymectomy immediately after that (we favour transsternal approach); introduce high doses of Prednisolone (2 mg/kg) every second day after thymectomy and keep the patient on that dose until he becomes symptom free and completely not dependant of AHE drugs. After that reduce gradually the corticosteroid. On very rare occassions the need for some additional therapy took place (plasma exchange, cyclosporine). Patients with ocular myasthenia were not thymectomized. The therapeutic results significantly differ in these two periods: the mortality was lowered from 7.5 to 0.6% and the number of JMG children, who were relatively easy and rapidly brought up to the full remission (during which they were symptom and medicament free) ascended from 7.5% to definite 74.3% and possible 83.3% (if we include the 'fresh' cases approaching the full remission). JMG patients who could not be brought to full remission following the recommended therapy improved a lot, but never achieved the possibility to be taken off the medicaments (16.7%). We report a patient with late onset celiac disease and neurological manifestations including myopathy, polyneuropathy and ataxia. Laboratory investigations showed positive antigliadin antibodies and severe vitamin E deficiency. Muscle biopsy revealed typical features of inclusion body myositis. Gluten-free diet and vitamin E supplementation reversed both the clinical neurological manifestations as well as the abnormalities in the muscle biopsy. Anti-gliadin antibodies were no longer present. This case illustrates the spectrum of neurological complications of celiac disease and for the first time documents reversible inclusion body pathology in the muscle. Common immunological mechanisms may be at play in celiac disease and IBM. Whether more cases of IBM or other inflammatory myopathies prove to have an association with celiac disease should be investigated, given the positive outcome with appropriate treatment. Hypokalemic disease is a disorder in which the amount of serum's potassium declines and the patient faces limbs weakness. Eye and respiratory muscles rarely become involved and death may follow due to respiratory paralysis and heart conducting disturbances. As this disease is treatable and progressive weakness can be prevented, therefore in the study conducted we attempted to compare between the causes and epidemiological characteristics and start of clinical manifestation and the characteristics of this disease with what had been presented in other sources in order to take effective measure for timely diagnosis. The records of hypokalemically paralyzed patients hospitalized during 1990-2000 were used to collect the data such as general condition, systematic and neurologic examination, serum potassium level, ABG, ECG were extracted as and used for analysis. 27 patients were identified as hypokalemic afflicted to paralysis and all were sporadic cases. The starting age for attack was 29 years. 96.3% were male and the rest were female. The level of potassium in attack was mostly within 1-3.5 meq/l and most changes in ECG were related to decrease in height at T and appearance of U-waves. 11 patients had more than three attacks (40.7%), 10 patients faced all-attacks (37.3%) and six patients experienced two times attacks (22%). Hypokalemic paralysis disorder is a treatable disease, immediate diagnosis and treatment reduces cardiac and muscular problems, it is necessary for the physicians who treat patients referring with flaccid paralysis to keep in mind four limbs of this disease and diagnostic measures.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2357"}, {"text": "Hypokalemic periodic paralysis with atypical presentation D. C. Marinescu and O. Bajenaru Neurology Department, University Emergency Hospital, Bucharest, Romania Introduction: Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is an ionic channel disease with sometimes atypical forms and sporadic cases. Case report: We present a 54-year-old woman who experienced for the last 3-4 years episodes of bilateral palpebral ptosis, palpitations, sweating, marked anxiety, exhaustion; sometimes also with bi-brachial, symmetrical, predominantly distal motor deficit with depressed tendon reflexes. The attacks lasted for 2-6 h, typically in the early morning, precipitated by physical effort. They appeared one to two times daily for 2-3 weeks, with pauses of 2-4 weeks. Inter-critically neurological examination was normal. There was no significant familial or personal history. General medical examination and complete endocrinological work-up in a specialized department were normal. Cerebral CT scan was normal. Intracritical, ECG showed a prolonged QTc interval, without ectopic beats at 24 h ECG Holter monitoring. Seric potassium dropped to 2.8-3.1 mmol/l during the attacks, from normal basal values. Other seric electolytes, acid-base status and urinary ionogram were constantly normal. EMG exercise test and a provocative test with oral glucose were positive for HPP. The attacks responded to orally KCl and subsided after prevention treatment with acetazolamide 500 mg daily. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the second case of HPP with onset in a woman above her thirties, and the first sporadic one described (possibly a de novo mutation of the HPP gene). The atypical clinical presentation with facial and brachial involvement and its sporadic nature are peculiarities that should be kept in mind in order not to delay the positive diagnosis of a treatable, even rare, condition.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2361"}, {"text": "Progressive limb girdle myopathy: Do not forget the amylo\u00efdosis F.

Case report: a woman with a treated dyslipidemia, started, at 65, a slow progressive and painful weakness of her pelvic and scapular girdles, with amyotrophy. After 3 years, the biological assessment was normal except CK at 2500 IU/l (n < 200). MRI showed a fatty infiltration of the pelvic muscles. Muscular biopsy showed non-specific abnormalities. The hypothesis of a myopathy due to the treatment of the dyslipidemia was adopted. Two years later, the weakness increased. A new muscular biopsy was performed with a marked muscular atrophy with fibrosis, necrosis, but without inflammatory cells. The biological assessment revealed an hypogammaglobulinemia and a MGUS with light chain lambda. The diagnosis of muscular amylosis associated with a MGUS was recognized when the previous biopsy was reviewed with a red Congo specific coloration and the positivity of the deposit of specific antibodies anti light chain lambda on muscle fibers. A treatment of myeloma permitted to stabilize the myopathy. Discussion: Amylo\u0131\u00a8dosis myopathy is typical of AL amylosis. The clinical symptoms can be muscular hypertrophy with macroglossia, or, rarely, an aspect of dystrophic myopathy with hyperckemia. So, in case of this clinical aspect, it is necessary to search actively a gammapathy and to do specific coloration on the muscular biopsy specimen. Do not recognize this diagnosis it is missing the chance of a treatment that can stop the evolution of the muscular disease. Several cases of Rhabdomyolisis and myopathy during the course of Hepatitis-C (HC) have been decribed in the recent years. The muscular involvement in HC has been related to the interferon (IFN) therapy, but some authors reported cases of myopathy in non-treated patients hypothesizing a direct pathogenic role of hepatitis-C virus. Herein, we report on a 46year-old man, with chronic HC, who began to complain muscle weakness and hyperckemia in the last 2 years.

Campos 4 Introduction and objectives: Because of the test of neuromuscular transmission in patients with mitochondrial diseases (MD) have not been clearly defined, we have reviewed our experience in the patients with this condition. Material and methods: Conventional EMG, nerve conduction studies and SFEMG were performed in 18 patients with various phenotypes of MD, 11 females and seven males aged 14-75 years. Results: 14 cases showed findings consistent with mild myopathy, two patients with signs of sensory-motor axonal neuropathy and two cases a mixture of myopathy and axonal neuropathy. Motor unit fiber density was mildly increased in eight of 13 tested cases. Jitter was abnormal in 10 of 18 tested patients. Jitter abnormalities were not related to phenotype, myopathic or neurogenic features in the EMG study, and may be observed in muscles without clinical weakness. Conclusion: The results suggest the existence of neuromuscular transmission disturbances in patients with MD. Orbital myositis is an idiopathic inflammation of the extraoccular muscles. It is often included under broad description orbital pseudotumor commonoly it is unilateral affection. We report one case of bilateral orbital myositis in 45-year-old women. The first symptom was diplopia and an acute bilateral orbital pain exacerbated on eyes movement. Physical examination especially neurological was normal. Creatine kinase serum level and biological thyroid function was normal. CT scan found a bilateral enlargement of rectus oculi medialis and lateralis. Clinical improvement was obtained few days after oral corticosteroid treatement with remission of all signs. Orbital myositis is rare entity. In 90-95% it is unilateral, bilateral forms are exceptional in these cases some aetiology must be searched particularly thyroid ophtalmopathy. There is controversy in treatement options but corticosteroid is steel the most common first choice therapy with good outcome. Some diagnosis criteria were purposed by Attarian et al, included: acute orbital pain, enlargement of one or more extra-ocular muscles, absence of clinical or biological thyroid dysfunction and rapid response to immunomodulator treatment. Through our observation and literature review we discuss a clinical and therapeutic aspect of this affection. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a systemic disease with abnormal prolonged CTG sequences involving the muscle, heart, eye, and endocrine system. Sudden cardiac death is one of the main causes of death in patients with DM. An association between a prolonged QTc interval and sudden cardiac death has been presented in various diseases. We reviewed the electrocardiography of 39 patients with DM. QTc interval was calculated according to Bazett's formula (QTc=QTvR-R), and compared with 40 age-matched controls. Clinical features and the number of CTG repeats were evaluated. The mean QTc value of patients with DM (453.8 \u00b1 45.3) is significantly higher than that of normal controls (391.8 \u00b1 18.0) (P < 0.05). Long-term follow-up of interval changes of QTc in DM patients may give useful information about cardiac involvement and predictor of sudden cardiac death. Beside the cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) a high percentage of these patients also has cognitive impairments. These deficits primarily concern executive functions linked to dysfunctions in prefrontal cortex regions. In this study, we assessed decision-making abilities in patients with PD in a gambling-task with explicit rules to investigate the possible association between decision-making and executive functions in PD. For this purpose we examined 17 non-demented PD patients and 17 healthy control subjects (CG) with a neuropsychological test battery and the Game of Dice Task. In this computerized gambling-task a single dice and a shaker are used. Before each throw, subjects have to choose a single number or a combination of numbers (2, 3, or 4 numbers together). Two alternatives are classified as disadvantageous since they are related to high gains but also high losses with a low winning probability (1:6 and 2:6). The remaining two alternatives are classified as advantageous as they lead to low gains but also low losses having a winning probability of 50% and more (3:6 and 4:6). Subjects are asked to increase their starting capital within 18 dice throws. PD patients were impaired in this gambling-task (mean frequency of disadvantageous choices: PD = 10.3; CG = 4.1; P< .001). In PD patients the frequency of disadvantageous choices was correlated with executive functions (categorization and set-shifting). Results reflect decision-making impairments in PD patients linked to executive dysfunctions. These might be due to decreased dopaminergic innervation of prefrontal cortex regions resulting from disturbances of dopaminergic fronto-striatal loops. The present study was performed to determine whether the cognitive status of patients with cerebellar degeneration might be related to neurological severity. The group of 65 patients (mean age = 43.5; SE = 1.5) with cerebellar degeneration and a group of 37 healthy controls (mean age = 45.1, SE = 1.3) underwent a comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological examination. The neuropsychological tests assessed general intellectual ability, different aspects of memory (episodic, semantic and implicit memory) and frontal executive deficits. Motor and visual skill learning abilities were also assessed. Although the cerebellar patients have got lower scores on Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) in comparison to control group, these patients did not meet the criteria for dementia. The cerebellar patients were significantly impaired on episodic memory delayed recall tasks. Impairment on several executive tasks, such as digit symbol modality, verbal fluency and Tower of Toronto was also noted in the cerebellar group. The cerebellar group was less successful on skill learning tasks, either on motor or visual tasks. Two cognitive deficits, delayed recall of word list, and digit symbol test, were significantly related to ataxia score, but none was related to simple motor score in the cerebellar group. A significant difference between patients with cerebellar plus and pure cerebellar syndromes was shown in particular for motor tasks, and on general cognitive abilities. This provides further evidence implicating the particular role of cerebellum in cognition, independent of motor deficits, and the additional frontal-subcortical dysfunction in patients with cerebellar degeneration. Introduction: STN stimulation has positive effects on most dopa responsive symptoms of Parkinsons's disease (PD) patients. Its consequences on cognitive functions are still a matter of debate. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of chronic bilateral STN stimulation on dopa sensitive cognitive tasks, by assessing the performance at a choice reaction time (CRT) task previously shown to be specifically sensitive to the action of L-Dopa. Methods: Twelve patients with PD who underwent treatment by bilateral STN stimulation as on average 2 years (26.67 \u00b1 14.81 months) participated in the study. They performed visual and auditory CRT tasks, either as single or as concurrent tasks, with (ONDrug) or after a withdrawal of their antiparkinsonian drugs (OFFDrug). During each condition, the patients were evaluated with the stimulators turned on (ONStim) or off (OFFStim). Results: Only six patients were able to perform the tasks in the OFFDrug-OFFStim condition. Our results suggest that STN stimulation had no significant effect on single CRT tasks (visual task, P = 0.23; auditory task, P = 0.46). In the concurrent tasks, STN stimulation significantly improved the error rate during the competitive condition (P = 0.01). The combination of both treatments (STN stimulation and L-dopa) tended to increase visual CRT (P = 0.06). Conclusion: Our results are in favour of a dopamimetic action of the STN stimulation on a complex cognitive task. The association of STN stimulation and L-dopa tends to involve a hyperactivation of the dopaminergic ways. Objective: To examine the impact of anosognosia upon professional caregiver's burden associated with the care of demented patients. Design or methods: 65 older demented subjects; 41 women and 24 men; 75-94 years old (79 + 54) were included in the study. Subjects were admitted at Charles Richet Alzheimer day hospital for following a programme of cognitive stimulation and psychosocial rehabilitation. Each patient was submitted to a clinical investigation, a cerebral imagery (CT scan and/or MRI) and a standardized neuropsychological battery. Autonomy was evaluated with the IADL and the ADL scales. Behavioural disturbances were evaluated with two scales: FBI: Frontal Behaviour Inventory, and the BRSD: Behaviour Rating Scale for Dementia. Anosognosia of memory deficit (AMD) and Anosognosia of behavioural disturbance (ABD) were measured as the 'discrepancy scores' between patient self-report and a family's member ratings of patient on MacNair and FBI scales. The 'Professional Caregiver's Dementia Burden Index' (PCDBI; maximal score: 120), designed for this study, was used to evaluate the caregivers' burden of the staff of the day hospital. Multiple linear regressions were used to examine the correlations between the quantitative variables. Results: Positive correlations were found between the PCDBI and both AMD and ABD scores (P < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between the PCDBI and MMSE,IADL or ADL scores (P > 0.05). However, the PCDBI was strongly correlated with FBI and BRDS (P < 0.0005). Conclusions: Professional caregiver's burden is correlated with the degree of patients' unawareness of memory impairment and behavioural abnormalities independently of the severity of cognitive decline or functional impairment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2364"}, {"text": "Parkinson's disease and information processing B.

Gil 1 1 Service de Neurologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Jean Bernard; and 2 Laboratoire 'Performance, Motricite\u00b4et Cognition', Universite\u00b4de Poitiers, France A popular approach to the study of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been to employ Reaction Time (RT) paradigms. Many studies have investigated how PD affects RT but the results are inconsistent. The present study was designed to re-evaluate the effect of Parkinson's disease on different stages of information processing. This issue was addressed using the additive factor method. (Sternberg, 1969) The experimenter manipulates a variable of interest (PD) in combination with one or more additional factors that have a known locus of effect (Signal quality, stimulus-response compatibility and fore-period duration). 16 healthy subjects and 16 PD patients took part in this study. Patients were tested when medicated and when free of all antiparkinsonian medication. Each subject performed a four-choice visual RT task over two consecutive days. The effects of the three variables were found to be additive on RT, indicating that the three stages manipulated -namely, feature extraction, response selection, and motor adjustment were independent. Patients are slower than matched control subjects (1135 ms vs. 925 ms). A significant interaction was observed between group factor and signal quality factor (F 1,29 = 4.54 ; P < 0.05). This results are in agreement with a significant degradation of CRT in Parkinson's disease but this deficit seem to be associated with a deficit of visual information processing (Abet et al., 2003) more than a decisional deficit (Brown et al., 1993) . The results show that PD specifically affects the perceptual stage while it spares the decisional and motor stages. Links between depression and memory complaint have been principally examined in subjects in whom complaint was purpose of consultation. The present study was designed to investigate characters and environment of depression as well as cognitive impacts. 1597 volunteers did receive cognitive test battery including: a self-questionnaire with four scales (depression, anxiety, somatization and hostility) (Kellner, 1987) ; a numeric scale of memory self-evaluation; a rapid evaluation of cognitive function test. Two groups have been constituted in accordance with the presence or absence of depressive symptomatology. Cognitive performance of the two groups does not differ. Depressed individuals are significantly younger as well as more anxious; they have more psychosomatic reaction and they have more memory complaints than no-depressed individuals. Logistic regression analyse show that the only factors associated with depression are respectively, anxiety [coef(b) = -0.3], hostility [coef(b) = -0.08], somatization [coef(b) = -0.06] and memory complaint [coef(b) = +0.1]. This study supports the idea that memory complaint may be observed with no signs of real cognitive impairment but be in link with psycho affective characteristic (Hanninen et al., 1994; Dentone et Insua, 1997) . The finding of a real memory problem in depressed individuals, who complain of failing memory, must be ascribed to depression with caution. Ten non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (mean age 59, mean duration 4 years, in Hoehn-Yahr state I-III, all treated with levodopa) were examined using a Nissen-Bullemer's serial reaction learning task and Sternberg's declarative short-term memory test. Patients were tested in two conditions: (i) optimal 'on' motor state, (ii) in defined 'off' state (after overnight withdrawal of therapy). Our results in non-declarative task significantly differed between both conditions (P < 0.001), patients scores improved after D1/D2 stimulation. Declarative memory test also statistically differed (P < 0.05), however, patients results were better in 'off' state. Our results support the conclusion that D1/D2 stimulation sufficient for motor and procedural learning improvement in PD, can lead paradoxically to deterioration of short-term declarative memory. Methods: This post hoc analysis of pooled data from four large placebo-controlled trials included 362 galantaminetreated (24 mg/day) and 332 placebo-treated patients with very mild AD (Mini Mental State Examination score 3 21). Outcomes included 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog/11), Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus caregiver input (CIBIC-plus), and Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale (DAD) for activities of daily living. Results: 65% of patients included in analysis completed 6 months of treatment. ADAS-cog scores significantly improved in the galantamine group at the 3-4 week assessment (-0.22; P < 0.001) and continued to 6 months (-1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.2, -0.8; P < 0.001), while patients receiving placebo remained stable (0.1 at 6 months; 95% CI -0.6 to 0.9; P = 0.71).

In addition, significantly more patients receiving galantamine versus placebo were classified as 'improved' based on CIBIC-plus results (26.9% vs. 14.3%, P < 0.001) and 'maintained or improved' based on DAD scores (59% vs. 48%, P = 0.004).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 649, "end": 666, "text": "(Sternberg, 1969)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1698, "text": "(Abet et al., 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2272, "end": 2287, "text": "(Kellner, 1987)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3109, "end": 3132, "text": "(Hanninen et al., 1994;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3133, "end": 3156, "text": "Dentone et Insua, 1997)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1730, "end": 1750, "text": "(Brown et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "FIGREF34"}], "section": "P2381"}, {"text": "Conclusions: This study suggests that galantamine yields clinically relevant benefits to patients with very mild AD, including improved cognition and maintained or improved function.

All the patients developed a progressive dysarthria culminating in a complete mutism beside minimal difficulty with balance, weakness, and stiffness of the legs. Methods: In a first task each patient was asked to write from dictation a set of words (N = 15) of different length and name frequency, and a set of nonsense words (N = 10) of different length. In a second task the patient was instructed to compose the letter sequence of the words and non-words using a set of plasticized letters. Finally, the same words and non-words were presented in a printed form for the copy. Result: An high percentage of errors were detected for the two orally conditions in all the patients. Their performance was influenced by stimulus length, but not by the name frequency. In copy, few errors were detected for both types of stimuli. Conclusion: Our data are consistent with a central dysgraphic disorder in PLS with bulbar onset.

Doran Cognitive Function Clinic, Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Liverpool, UK Objective, and method and setting: To report clinical, neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging features in patients with frontotemporal dementia with motor neurone disease (FTD/MND) seen at a regional neuroscience centre cognitive function clinic over a 5 year period (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) . Results: Five patients were identified (M:F = 4:1, age range at onset = 48-79 years), four diagnosed during life, one at postmortem. None had a family history of FTD/MND. Three were referred with cognitive dysfunction, of whom two had lower motor neurone signs (fasciculation \u00b1 wasting); the third later developed upper motor neurone signs (spastic hemiplegia). Two patients were referred with concurrent onset of cognitive and motor dysfunction (upper and lower motor neurone signs). Neuropsychological assessments showed impaired frontal and temporal functions. Structural neuroimaging (CT, MRI) showed generalized atrophy, with asymmetric change noted in only one case (confirmed on SPECT scan). EMGs showed diffuse neurogenic change indicative of anterior horn cell disease. EEGs were normal. Discussion: FTD/MND was rarely encountered in this clinic (one case/year). Clinical phenotype at presentation was variable, but delayed diagnosis occurred only once. Neuropsychological assessments and EMG were the most helpful investigations. Conclusion: This study confirms phenotypic variation in FTD/MND patients presenting to a cognitive function clinic. The different initial manifestations of MND-inclusion dementia (dementia \u00b1 upper and/or lower motor neurone features) presumably reflect the predominant neuroanatomical locus of pathology, analogous to the variable presentations seen in Alzheimer's disease (isolated amnesia, agnosia, aphasia, apraxia, or combinations thereof) and Lewy body disease (isolated parkinsonism, dementia, autonomic failure, or combinations thereof). Objective: Depression can strike anyone, but people with Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive brain disorder, may be at greater risk. Treatment of depression helps people to manage both diseases, thus improving the quality of their lives. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that in addition to the motor symptoms of PD, some emotional changes are present in these patients. Materials and method: 346 patients with PD were examined, as well as the same number in a normal control group, matched by age, sex and years of schooling. All patients and controls were evaluated with the Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HDS). The MMSE was administered to all subjects. It seems that such deficits are closely correlated to the onset of depression. The Hamilton Scale was used to evaluate the presence of a depressive state. Results: Our study showed that symptoms of depression were present in 138 patients (about 40% of the pathological sample). Conclusions: The biochemical basis of depression in PD is unclear. Changes in the brain chemical messenger serotonin have been hypothesized as the key neurochemical mechanism. In support of this theory are reports of abnormal levels of serotonin metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid of depressed PD patients. Involvement of noradrenergic and dopaminergic brain pathways have also been implicated in neuropathological reports in PD patients with depression. Background and objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the pattern of cognitive impairment in subcortical vascular dementia (SVD) compared normal control group and to differentiate SVD from Alzheimer's disease (AD) using neuropsychological test. Methods: Three subject groups (25 SVD patients, 39 AD and 27 normal control) participated in this study. They were all matched for age and education period. SVD and AD dementia groups were matched for severity of dementia. All patients were evaluated in all cognitive domains by neuropsychological assessment. Results: Compared with a normal control group, SVD and AD patients demonstrated significant impairments in all cognitive domains. SVD patients showed greater deficits in semantic and phonemic word fluency, fist-edge-palm and alternating hand movement than AD patients. SVD patients showed more impairment in forwarding digit span and Stroop test for letter reading than normal control. However, AD patients did not show significant impairments in any cognitive domains compared with SVD patients. Conclusions: SVD patients have greater impairment of attention, and frontal executive function than AD patients matched for age, education, and overall dementia severity. It is suggested that these neuropsychological findings may help to differentiate SVD patients from AD patients. Background: Successful cognitive functioning is greatly dependent on working memory capacity. Frontal lobe activity is the most important for executive functions though nonfrontal brain structures also contributes. Simultaneous performance of two tasks is effective for estimation of executive functions. Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate significance of anterior/ posterior brain damage in dual task realization. Design or methods: Ten post-stroke patients with MRI documented focal brain lesions in the posterior/anterior parts of the right/left hemispheres were recruited for dual task performance. Dual task performance was evaluated by Letter Fluency and Pattern drawing tasks. Tasks were conducted singly and simultaneously. Performance on dual task will suffer if two tasks are similar, thus need the same executive resources. A two way (2 \u00b7 2) ANOVA with anterior versus posterior site and left versus right side of the lesion as between subject factors were computed on single dependent variables. Results and conclusions: The single task results showed no significant differences between the patients with anterior and posterior lesions. The dual task decrement in letter fluency was more pronounced in patients with left anterior lesions than in other patients, but not in pattern drawing. It was not confirmed the prediction that dual task cost or the larger of the two decrements would be more pronounced after anterior than posterior lesions. It is reviled that the patients with left hemisphere lesions had more decrement in letter fluency and in dual task performance than the patients with right hemisphere lesions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 117, "text": "(1999)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 118, "end": 124, "text": "(2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 125, "end": 131, "text": "(2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 132, "end": 138, "text": "(2002)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 139, "end": 145, "text": "(2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 543, "end": 549, "text": "(1999)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 550, "end": 556, "text": "(2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 557, "end": 563, "text": "(2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 564, "end": 570, "text": "(2002)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 571, "end": 577, "text": "(2003)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2389"}, {"text": "The cognitive problems in patients with depression O.

B. Souza Department of Neurology, St. Helena Hospital, Bras\u0131\u013aia, Brazil Background: Schizencephaly is an uncommon congenital disorder of cortical development. It is invariably characterized by a cortical cleft lined with gray matter. The cleft either clearly extends from the pial surface to the ventricle or appears as a cortical cleft closely associated with a focal ventricular abnormality. Epilepsy, psychomotor delay, and focal neurological deficit are commonly observed. Open clefts are known to have more severe clinical deficits than closed clefts. Objective: To correlate clinical and neuroimaging characteristics with the neuropsychological findings in children with schizencephaly. Subjects and methods: We describe the clinical, brain imaging, and neuropsychological cognitive performance of 11 children, five girls and six boys, aged from 5 to 17 year, with neuroradiologic diagnosis of schizencephaly. Magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography were reviewed by the authors and classified according to Barkovich. A clinical research protocol including birth history, presenting symptoms, neurological and physical examination, occurrence of seizures, neurodevelopmental outcome, language development and other related medical problems were created. The Wechesler Intelligence Scale for Children score (WISC) was correlated with clinical and neurorradiological findings. Results: MRI showed four unilateral closed-lip schizencephalies and three bilateral closed-lip schizencephalies. Five children presented with hemiparesis, while facial grimacing was observed in one patient. WISC values were better for the patients with unilateral than bilateral schizencephaly. Conclusion: Unilateral closed-lip schizencephaly was associated with better neurodevelopmental and cognitive performance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2395"}, {"text": "matched in age and in EDSS (M/F = 14/16 = 46.7%/53.3%; mean age = 30.4 \u00b1 7.3 years; mean EDSS = 2.8 \u00b1 0.9; mean disease duration = 6.0 \u00b1 7.6 years) and with 27 healthy controls matched in age (mean age = 30.4 \u00b1 8.4 years). All subjects were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory and a standard clinical evaluation (EDSS scale) in Neurology Department of Medical Academy in Lublin. Results: In MS group not treated with interferon 43.3% of MS patients suffered from depression, whereas in MS group treated with interferon beta only 8.3% had depressive symptoms. Compared with controls and MS patients treated with interferon beta those who were not treated with interferon beta showed statistically significant higher total BDI score (4.7 \u00b1 4.0 vs. 5.0 \u00b1 4.5 vs. 9.9 \u00b1 7.3, respectively; P < 0.05). Conclusions: Depression is a common mood disorder in multiple sclerosis but MS patients treated with interferon beta suffer fewer depressive symptoms compared to other MS patients. The intensity of depressive symptoms for MS patients treated with interferon beta is comparable with the intensity of depressive symptoms for healthy controls. On the basis of our research interferon beta does not seem to evoke depressive symptoms in MS patients. Background: Myasthenia gravis (MG) has occasionally been associated with cognitive decline (CD) attributed either to a possible central cytotoxic effect of antimyasthenic drugs or as a part of a central autoimmune response. Objective: To evaluate the cognitive function of MG patients in respect to their age, medication, autoimmune and clinical status. Methods: 28 patients with MG have been assessed, classified according to the Osserman criteria for MG and evaluated with the ADAScog and MMSE tests. Patients with CD had additionally neuroimaging. Daily dosage of pyridostigmine and AchAb levels were monitored. Results: The patients were divided into two groups according to their age: group I patients <50 years whereas group II patients >50 years. The mean age of group I was 28.5 \u00b1 6.1 years, 75% of those patients were classified as Osserman I and 25% as Osserman IIa. Daily dosage of pyridostigmine in group I was 150 \u00b1 50 mg and no patient with CD was observed in this group. Patients in group II had mean age 66.4 \u00b1 4 years, 27% were classified as Osserman I, 55% as Osserman IIa and 17% as Osserman IIb. CD (MMSE < 27) was observed in six patients (33%), who were classified as Osserman I (11%) and Osserman IIa (22%). Daily dosage of pyridostigmine in the patients with no CD was 220 \u00b1 91 mg and in the patients with CD 220 \u00b1 34 mg. Only one patient with CD showed low signal ischaemic areas in MRI. Conclusion: The CD could be described as age related with no significant correlation to the clinical and autoimmune status or medication. Effects of high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (MP, 1 g daily, for 5 days) on the sustained attention and attention focusing in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with clinical relapse were examined. 34 relapsing-remitting patients were included. The mean age was 39.4 (20-56) years, mean disease duration and mean Expanded Disability Status Scale scores were 6.6 (0.8-18) years and 4.1 (2-6.0), respectively. MS patients underwent psychological testing three times: immediately before and after MP treatment, and 6 months later. The trials: '100-7' and 'months of year backwards', The Concentration Endurance Test D-2, and The Visual Continuous Attention Test (DAUF) were used. 32 control subjects (mean age 37.2 years) with ischialgia, not receiving steroids, underwent the same testing procedure two times: at admission and on sixth day of hospitalization. Before MP treatment MS patient obtained significantly worse scores than controls on the DAUF test (significantly decreased number of correct reactions (P < 0.01), significantly increased number of incorrect reactions (P < 0.05), and significantly increased mean value of reaction times (P < 0.05)). There were no significant differences within MS and control subjects on other tests. Therapy with MP did not markedly change an ability to focus attention and keep the concentration over long period of time in MS patients. The aim of our study was to identify attention and memory disorders caused by pituitary tumors. Methods: Neuropsychological testing concerning factor analysis of brain activity in patients with focal brain lesions has been employed in our study. MRI was performed to validate the size and location of pituitary tumors. Results: A total of 150 patients diagnosed with pituitary adenomas (114 females and 36 males, aged 25-60) were enrolled into the study. Brain functions, i.e. attention and memory, have been found to be impaired in 100% of our cases. Disorders of modality-unspecific active level of attention were identified in all our patients. A decline of emotional, motor, sensor and intellectual types of attention was detected in 56.6, 22, 12 and 9.4% of studied patients, respectively. Modality-unspecific disorders were manifested by attention worsening, its exhaustion and volume decrease, and by inability to concentrate. Memory impairments were detected in 87% of patients. Modality-unspecific memory impairments accounted for 74%. Recent memory was found to be more vulnerable. Long-term memory impairment accounted for 26% and was found to be moderately pronounced. It could be treated with prompt and vigorous reassurance helping patients to cope with the defect in recognition of previously know places. Conclusions: Thus, modality-unspecific disorders of active level of attention and modality-unspecific memory impairments have been detected in patients with pituitary adenomas. Emotional attention deficits were the most common. Immediate memory and recent memory were found to be more vulnerable in patients with pituitary adenomas. Apathy is defined as a lack of motivation. Apathy is reported to be the most frequent behavioral symptom in Alzheimer's disease. Taking into account that behavioral symptoms are present since the beginning of the disease it could be of interest to have information on such symptoms in subject with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Method: This presentation will present results (base-line data) from the French PHRC-PRE-AL study, which was aimed at examining to examine the evolution of a cohort of 245 MCI patients (mean age = 72 \u00b1 5.5; mean Mini Mental Score = 7.5 \u00b1 1.3). Apathy was evaluated with the Apathy Inventory (IA) caregiver version. Evaluation of emotional blunting, lack of initiative and lack of interest leads to a maximum total score of 36. The population was divided in two subgroups. Patients with an IA total score higher than 0 were included in the MCI Apathetic subgroup (MCI-A). The comparative subgroup (MCI-NA) included patients with an IA total score of 0. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the MADRS scale. Cognitive performances were evaluated using an extensive neuropsychological battery (memory, executive function, language). Results: Apathy was detected in 38.37% of the patients. In the MCI-A (n = 94) the number of male and the MADRS score was significantly higher than in the MCI-NA group (n = 151). In term of cognitive performances comparison between the two subgroups (controlling for sex, and MADRS) indicated that the MCI-A group had significantly lower performances only for the verbal memory task (Ggrober & Buschke free and total recall). Corticosteroids influence hippocampal structure; while states of hypocortisolemia are associated with dentate granule cell apoptosis, hypercortisolism induces hippocampal atrophy. In accordance, these structural changes correlate with cognitive deficits and impaired control of HPA activity. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is also a target-site for the negativefeedback effects of glucocorticoids on stress-induced HPA activity and is implicated in working memory tasks and behavioral flexibility. Therefore, we though of interest to perform a behavioral and structural evaluation of the ACC in rats submitted to chronic exogenous treatment with corticosterone (a mixed ligand of both types of corticosteroid receptors) or dexamethasone (a specific ligand of glucocorticoid receptors) and compared data with both controls (normocortisolemic) and adrenalectomized (hypocortisolemic) rats. The working memory version of the Morris water maze and a reversal training task constitute the behavioral study, whilst the stereological analysis included the estimation of volumes and total number of neurons in different layers of the ACC. Dexamethasone-exposure impaired spatial working memory and reversal training but corticosterone-treated animals did not differ either from controls or dexamethasone-treated rats; hypocortisolemia failed to affect both parameters. In parallel, a significant reduction in the volume of the ACC in hypercortisolemic groups was found, whereas neuronal loss (layer II) was confined to dexamethasone-treatment animals. In conclusion, prolonged hypercortisolemia unequivocally impairs prefrontal cortex-dependent tasks and these behavioral deficits seem to be correlated with neurodegenerative changes, particularly in the main receptor field of this cortical area. These findings are likely to contribute to a better understanding of corticosteroid-induced psychosis in humans.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2395"}, {"text": "Changes of blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery and EEG parameters during cognitive effort I.

Method: The experimental group (EG) consisted of 38 children with DLD (27 boys, 11 girls, 5.1-10.0 years old) with no neurological or pervasive disorders, epilepsy nor sensory problems.

Method: The subjects of this study were 102 consecutive outpatients with MCI. The diagnosis was made by a panel of specialists, who reviewed all existing information and used the criteria of Mayo Clinic Group. All subjects were assessed by experienced psychiatrists and given a MADRS. Depression was defined according to DSM-IV criteria. The subjects with severe major depressive disorders that contributed to the observed cognitive difficulties were excluded. Results: Distribution and severity of depression scores revealed three patient groups: major depression 19.6% (n = 20), minor depression 26.5% (n = 27), and very few depressive symptoms 53.9% (n = 55). The mean MADRS score in the major depression group (indicative of mild depression) was 18.7 (SD 3.9), in the minor depression group 13 (SD 2.2), and in very few depressive symptoms group was 5.8 (SD 2.2). MADRS factor analysis with Varimax rotation identified three factors: the first consisting apparent and reported sadness, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts; the second consisting inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, suicidal thoughts; and the third consisting concentration difficulties and lassitude. Conclusion: We conclude that both major and minor depressions are common in MCI. Three factors were identified and labeled: pessimism-anhedonia, psychic anxiety-vegetative, and cognitive-inhibition.

Two cases were regarded as CDR stage 3 and one as CDR stage 1. In a 6-12 month follow-up period, clinical presentation of the cases remained unchanged. None of the cases had a previous dementia history. Hypothetic causes in our cases are disconnection due to strategically located hemorrhage as in the cases with strategically located infarcts, additional severe leukoareosis and carotid disease causing hemodynamic insufficiency. Strategically located hemorrhage may give rise to permanent dementia when vascular degenerative factors are in association. (Straszecka et al., 1997) . The aim of our study is to determine the link between cognitive disorders and the presence or not of (i) cerebral calcification (reported in 32.4% of SSc patients, Heron et al., 1999) and (ii) psychiatric difficulties. Method: 17 French native and schooling SSc patients were evaluated with a cognitive and a psychiatric assessment (all patients are female with an average age of 50). Cognitive evaluation was composed with neuropsychological tests assessing intellectual abilities, language, memory, attention concentration, arithmetic, drawing and visual capacities. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Beck Depression Inventory 13 items, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale composed the psychiatric evaluation. Results: Among the 17 patients investigated, 13 had evidence of a cognitive impairment consisting in difficulties in a shifting task and memory impairment. Ten patients had difficulties to elaborate a research strategy allowing the retrieval of information in long-term memory whereas three patients presented a storage deficit shown by the forgetting of learning information.

Methods: 23 patients with Alzheimer disease whose diagnosis was confirmed using the NINCDS-ADRDA and the DSM 4 criteria, and 11 normal subjects of the same age underwent MMN registration at the level of the FZ, CZ, PZ, T5, F8, T6 electrodes with a 500 ms interval between the two sequences of sounds, the first of 160 sounds of 700 Hz, the second of 30 sounds of 600 Hz with a hazardous repartition. Result: The MMN latency was significantly elongated with the Alzheimer patients at the CZ and T5 electrodes while the amplitudes were low in the FZ, F7 electrodes. Discussion: The lengthening of the MMN latency in the Alzheimer population suggests a delay in the activation of the wave's generators that is situated near the HESCHL GYRUS.

Invasive monitoring of ICP can be carried out to guide treatment decisions but this method cannot be used routinely due to the risk of serious complications. A non-invasive method for ICP monitoring would therefore be very useful. The aim of this study was to assess a new device for the non-invasive measurements (NIM) of intracranial pressure. Methods: The new device consists of a specially developed miniature pressure sensor, which can measure pressure changes in the outer ear, which is sealed airtight. These pressure changes correspond to changes of ICP since there is direct communication from the subarachnoid space via the perilymph and cerebrospinal fluid, the cochlear aqueduct and inner ear to the tympanic membrane. Cardiac-derived ICP variations of the NIM were scaled by head-position changes and absolute calibration by varying positive end-expiratory pressure. NIM of ICP was carried out in 20 patients whose ICP was also being monitored invasively due to severe head injury. Patients with very high ICP or an unstable circulation were excluded. Results: Non-invasive monitoring was possible in one or both ears in all 20 patients.

We have tentatively established the role of late auditory (N100) and cognitive evoked potentials (MMN) for awakening in a large prospective study of 346 severe comatose patients categorized by etiology. Coma was caused by stroke (n = 125), trauma (n = 96), anoxia (n = 64) complications of neurosurgery (n = 54) and encephalitis (n = 7). Patients were followed for 12 months and classified as awake or unawake. Univariate and multivariate analyses of 10 clinical and electrophysiological variables were performed using regression logistic and Cox models. Kaplan-Meier survival method was performed to draw curves of awakening. Pupillary light reflex, N100, middle-latency evoked potentials, age and etiology were the most discriminating factors for awakening. Statistical analysis showed that pupillary reflex was the strongest prognostic variable for awakening (P = 79.7%). The probability of awakening rose to 86.9% when N100 was present. It was only 13.7% when pupillary reflex was absent in anoxic coma. When MMN was present 88.6% of patients awakened, and none became permanently vegetative. Pupillary reflex is the strongest pronostic variable followed by primary and late cortical evoked potentials. Our validated model of awakening includes three clinical and two electrophysiological variables. The presence of MMN precludes comatose patients from moving to a permanent vegetative state.

O. Kleine, 1 L. Benes 2 and P. Purpose: Acute care patients may suffer from multiorgan dysfunction; therefore, damage markers of brain and nonnervous tissues were monitored here with patients of critical care units who had creatine kinase (CK) activities >100 U/l in blood serum. Methods: Serum samples of 390 patients with intracerebral bleeding, acute stroke or seizures with distinct disabilities were monitored within 36 h of admission for markers of brain damage [neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S-100B], of skeletal muscle damage [CK, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)], of heart muscle failure [CK-MB mass, troponin I, a-hydroxy-butyrate dehydrogenase (a-HBDH)], of dysfunction of kidney, liver, bile or salivary cells, of inflammation or inflammatory stress (leukocytes, granulocytes, glucose, electrolytes). The markers were analyzed with two-side immunoluminometric assays (Byk-Santec Diagnostica), sandwich immunoassays (Dade Behring) and mechanized routine assays (Roche Diagnostics) (CV of imprecision <18%, inaccuracy <17%). Results: Markers of brain damage rose together with markers of non-nervous tissues to varying frequencies in serum of acute care patients. Significant correlations between NSE and S100B levels ascertained brain damage, those between elevated NSE contents and markers of heart failure indicated brain hypoxia. Increased S100B levels did not show such correlations, suggesting S100B release from other organs. Significant correlations between S100B and markers of inflammation or inflammatory stress pointed to release from non-nervous tissues with high S100B contents, e.g. of cartilage, fat, skin which exhibited clinical signs of damage. Conclusions: Multiorgan dysfunction was revealed by determination of NSE, S100B together with markers of non-brain damage in serum of acute care patients. A non-brain specific release of S100B was indicated. Cerebral ischemia is a condition that is most commonly seen following subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracranial hypertension. Transcranial near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can provide the valuable information on brain oxygenation in the patients with cerebral ischemia due to internal carotid artery occlusion (ICA), severe brain injury (SBI), brain tumor or intracranial hemorrhage. The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy of NIRS for cerebral ischemia in neurosurgical patients with both cerebral vasospasm and intracranial hypertension. Method: Two study groups were compared. There were 22 healthy volunteers in the first group and 61 neurosurgical patients in the second group. 17 patients had cerebral vasospasm following arterial aneurysm rupture, 10 suffered from SBI, 12 patients had ICA occlusion, 10 patients had brain tumor and 12 patients suffered from intracranial hemorrhage. Cerebral blood flow velocity was determined by intracranial Dopplerometry (DWL, Multidop). Bilateral cerebral oxygenation (rSO 2 ) was monitored by INVOS 4100. Mean arterial blood pressure (ABP) and peripheral pulse oximetry were recorded. Intracranial pressure was detected by intraparenchymal Codman microsensor in the second group. Results: Significant differences between the two groups, in both mean ABP and rSO 2 , were detected. Median rSO 2 was much lower in neurosurgical patients. In the second group there was direct correlation between Glasgow Come Scale and both mean ABP and rSO 2 .

The definition of human's death and organ procurement from 'heart beating' donors on the basis of the BD diagnosis was legalized in Russia since 1992. The special Mobile Neurodiagnostic Group (MNDG), consisting of neurophysiologists with good experience in intensive care units (ICU) was formed in 1995. The main aim of MNDG is to go out to Moscow hospitals to investigate patients in progredient coma. As of today we have investigated more than 800 patients. BD diagnosis was confirmed in 11% of cases. The confirmatory tests, listed in a law, that concern the definition of BD, include electroencephalogram (EEG) and, in several cases to reduce the waiting period, cerebral angiography (CA). To monitor brain's bioelectric activity and blood flow status, we also used EEG, transcranial Doppler (TCD), multimodality evoked potentials (MEP). Simultaneously we compared the data of CA and TCD of 11 patients. 70% of patients with 'stop-contrast' phenomenon showed residual blood flow during TCD. The apnoic test (AT) was performed with 90 patients with BD criteria. Complications appeared in more then 50% of cases. The analysis of received data, showed that complex of non-invasive EEG, TCD, MEP, rapidly performed at the bedside, could be a better alternative to CA.

The rats subjected with intravenously administration photosensitive dye Bengal Rose (40 mg/ kg) and irradiated from halogen light source (24 V, 250 W) through an intact cranium (Watson et al., 1985) . Behavioural impairments were evaluated by the registration of the passive avoidance (PA) response latency before and on the ninth day after bilateral photothrombosis of prefrontal cortex.

In patients with primary brain disorders a concomitant affection of peripheral nerves or muscles may pose a diagnostic difficulty. Four patients were admitted to the ICU after massive subarachnoidal haemorrhage (two), bleeding into brain tumor, and basilar artery occlusion. They were comatose and needed ventilatory support. Early after admission they received pancuronium (4 mg/day) and one of them hydrocortisone (200 mg/day for 15 days). Variably expressed pyramidal signs were eventually replaced by flaccid tetraplegia while the respiratory weakness persisted. Serum CK was normal in three and slightly increased in one. Diagnostics included NCS, repetitive nerve stimulation test, concentric needle EMG, and muscle biopsy. CMAPs were substantially diminished with normal motor conduction. Sural SNAPs were elicited in three patients, and absent in one with severe limb oedema. No neuromuscular transmission deficit was detected. EMG exhibited abundant fibrillation potentials, while motor unit potentials could not be recruited due to coma. Light microscopy showed no major findings in three, and fibre necrosis in one patient. Electron microscopy showed myosin loss in all patients. Our critically ill patients with primary brain disorder secondarily developed areflexic paralysis. The condition is in such situation more difficult to recognize (pre-existing respiratory and limb weakness of central origin). NCS and EMG were helpful in localizing the pathology to the motor unit. Light microscopy was informative in one case only. Electron microscopy proved the condition in all patients to be myopathy with myosin loss.

Seizure was an initial sign of stroke in 42%, during stroke occurrences in 39%, and in 18% a post-stroke sign. Focal seizures occurred in 32%, general in 37%, and partial onset with secondary generalization we observed in 31% patients. We conclude that first ever seizure may be a very important brain injury symptom, so the prompt recognition of underlying substrate may lead to an early rational treatment, and can improve survival.

Objective: To describe a Filipino kindred with a novel autosomal-dominant cerebellar ataxia syndrome. Methods: Clinical description, direct mutation analysis, and PCR using linked microsatellite markers. Results: We examined 19 individuals (10 affected) from three generations. The proband (82 years female) had onset at age 60. She has 13 children aged 44-64 years: seven females (four affected) and six males (three affected). The seven affected had onset ranging from 22 to 49 years (mean: 38 years). The third generation has two mildly affected individuals (mean onset: 24.5 years): a 28-year-old female (onset age: 26) and her 24year-old brother (onset age: 23). Cerebellar signs among the 10 affected included gait and limb ataxia, titubation, hypotonia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Two had mild hyperreflexia with no Babinski. Two had sensory lower limb deficits. Cognitive impairment was noted in the proband. One had mild urinary incontinence. Duration of disease range from 1 to 42 years (mean: 13).

Background: Previous investigations indicate a gender-specific relationship between a maternal history of stroke and the prevalence of hypertension in female patients with ischemic cerebrovascular events. Methods: We evaluated 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), potentially involved in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension for gender specific associations with maternal and paternal history of stroke in patients suffering from ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. A total of 1044 patients [median age: 69, 475 (45.5% ) female] with ischemic cerebrovascular event were investigated using a multilocus genotyping assay. For those polymorphisms, which showed a significant interaction between maternal history of stroke and gender, we investigated male and female patients separately. Results: The frequency of heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the Gly460Trp polymorphism of the a-adducin gene was significantly higher in patients with a positive maternal history of stroke (P = 0.005) but also showed a significant interaction with patient's gender. Female patients carrying the Trp allele polymorphism had a markedly higher prevalence of a maternal history of stroke than homozygous carriers of the Gly allele (OR for heterozygous carriers = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1-3.1, P = 0.014; OR for homozygous carriers = 5.3, 95% CI = 2.0-14.4, P = 0.001).

All patients were submitted to a detailed physical examination with grading cerebellar and non-cerebellar signs (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe). Genetic analysis was performed with PCR highly denaturing polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis, and silver staining technique. SCA1 was identified in 35 patients from 13 families (33.3% of all ADCA), and SCA2 in nine patients from five families (12.8%). One patient had expansion of combined CTA/CTG repeats on SCA8 locus. Gaze palsy, dysmetric saccades, spasticity and hyperreflexia were significantly more frequently found in SCA1 compared to SCA2 patients, while slow saccades, areflexia and dystonia were more observed in SCA2 (\u201a2 test). Patients with 'pure cerebellar' syndrome had significantly less pronounced all cerebellar signs compared to 'cerebellar plus' patients (Mann-Whitney test). Conclusion: Although they can be accurately diagnosed only on the basis of the molecular genetic analysis there are some clinical differences between SCA1 and SCA2. 'Cerebellar plus' patients have worse prognosis not only because of the presence of non-cerebellar signs but the intensity of degenerative process in cerebellum is probably more pronounced.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 732, "end": 748, "text": "[median age: 69,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 749, "end": 759, "text": "475 (45.5%", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2435"}, {"text": "Gene expression profiles of peripheral T-cells in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins N.

Methods: A total of 60 patients from Slavonic population were included in to the trial. Diallelic TAI I polymorphism in the 5\u00a2 flanking region of the PARP-1 gene was studied. The presence of restriction site for TAI I was marked as (+), absence as (-). PARP-1 levels were assessed in CSF on days 1 and 3 after the stroke onset using ELISA technique. Magnetic resonance imaging and slice-to-slice manual morphometry were used for calculation of the IV on days 1, 3, 7, 21 after IS onset. Results: The genotype distributions were according to the Hardy-Weinberg equation. By y-correlation analysis a clear correlation between PARP-1 gene TAI I polymorphism and the infarction volume was observed. For instance, for day 1 y = 0.31, P = 0.02. In this point average IV was significantly larger in patients with (-/-) genotype versus (-/+) and (+/+) carriers on day 7 after the stroke onset (P = 0.0006). Statistical analysis revealed an association between CSF PARP-1 levels and IV on day 3 after the stroke onset; in patients with high PARP-1 levels large size infarctions prevailed (P = 0.05). Discussion: Our results show the significant dependence of the IV on PARP-1 gene TAI I polymorphism and the level of PARP-1 in CSF. Objective: Several association genome-wide screens, based on pooled DNA, have been performed to determine genetic factors involved in MS. These results need to be confirmed with individual genotyping in new patient materials. The aim of this study was to investigate the results from three independent Nordic screens based on individual typing. Methods: We collected 328 Caucasian Nordic trio families and 372 unrelated control individuals from Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Iceland. 47 microsatellite markers were selected for individual typing. Two comparisons were made; Fisher's exact test for cases and controls and TDT for testing the trio families. Furthermore, the importance of HLA-DR2 carrier status was investigated for markers confirmed associated to MS. Results: 33 markers were successfully genotyped and statistical analyzed. Fourteen and eleven regions were found associated to MS by Fisher's exact test and TDT, respectively. Conclusion: Seven regions [6p21 (HLA), 19q13, 17q11, 11q23, 1p34, 1q22] were found to be significantly (P < 0.05) associated to MS in both Fisher's test and TDT. Of these regions 11q23 and 1p34 were the supported with the strongest evidence, apart from the HLA-region. Charcot-Marie tooth disease (CMT) is the most common inherited motor and sensory peripheral neuropathy. The axonal form of CMT, or CMT type 2 (CMT2), is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder with several assigned autosomal dominant loci. Recently it was reported of a new locus (CMT2F) for autosomal dominant CMT2 neuropathy that was mapped within a 15 cM region on chromosome 7q11-q21 in a large Russian family. By this moment, we performed in this family fine mapping of the CMT2F locus using a set of short tandem repeat (STR) markers located inside of the previously defined region and flanking markers. Using these additional markers, we narrowed the CMT2F locus. Haplotype analysis with the new additional markers demonstrates that the disease gene maps to chromosome 7q11-q21, with the critical interval reduced to 7.5 cM. We also performed the histopathologic examination of peripheral nerves (n. suralis) in patients from the CMT2F family, and the obtained results confirming axonal degeneration in affected persons.

Sarzynska-Dlugosz, G. Gromadzka, M. Baranska-Gieruszczak and A. Czlonkowska 2nd Department of Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw, Poland Background and purpose: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) influences recovery in an isoform-specific manner after various forms of brain injury. We aimed to investigate if the carrying of ApoE genotypes is associated with the risk of death during 1-year after ischemic stroke (IS) and if the effect is gender-dependent. Methods: The analysis of ApoE genotypes was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragments length polymorphism method in 358 patients (183 women and 175 men) with IS. The clinical data were collected prospectively according to the Stroke Data Bank protocol with further minor modifications. Stroke severity was evaluated with the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS). Multivariate regression model were used to analyze predictors of death. Results: In male population the carrying of genotype ApoE E3/E4 was associated with the highest frequency of death during 1-month after IS; genotype E3/E3 -with the lowest 1-year mortality rate after IS. Multivariate logistic regression models adjusted by known risk factors of poor outcome after stroke revealed in men: heart failure (OR = 3.91), excessive alcohol consumption (OR = 4.98), stroke severity (OR = 1.04) and ApoE genotype E3/E4 (OR = 3.05) as independent predictors of death during 1-month after IS; stroke severity (OR = 1.06) as independent predictor of 1-year mortality after IS. ApoE genotype E3/E3 was an independent protective factor of death during 1-year after IS (OR = 0.35) in men population. In women the carrying of any genotypes was not a significant predictor of death during 1-year after IS. Conclusions: The carrying of ApoE genotypes plays a role on stroke mortality during 1-year after IS in men but not in women. Early onset (<40 years) Parkinson's disease (EOPD) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by early onset of typical signs of parkinsonism. Pathological hallmark consists of selective loss of neurons in substantia nigra without Lewy bodies. The responsible gene was identified and designated Parkin. The Parkin gene, located on chromosome 6q25.2-27, contains 12 exons spanning 1.53 Mb and encodes an E2-dependent E3 ubiquitin protein ligase that has a role in the proteasome-mediated degradation of target substrates. To date, a variety of mutations in the Parkin gene have been reported, including exonic rearrangements (deletions and multiplications) and several missense mutations. The mutations are found predominantly in earlyonset cases and the frequency decreased with increasing of age at onset (AAO). For evaluating the role of the Parkin gene in late onset Parkinson's disease (LOPD) cases, we performed a molecular screening of the 12 coding exons in 18 families originated from southern Italy, with a probable autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease and an AAO of 45 years or older. The conventional mutational analysis included polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the PCR products of the 12 exons on both strands. For identifing any exon rearrangements we performed gene dosage analysis using real time PCR 7900 HT-SDS (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). We did not find any Parkin mutations either by the conventional mutational analysis or with real time PCR in 18 lateonset PD families. Our results suggest that Parkin gene do not play an important role in developing LOPD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2441"}, {"text": "Identification of differentially expressed genes in recessive axonal Charcot-Marie tooth disease using PCR-select cDNA subtraction F.

This method combines subtractive hybridization with PCR to generate a population of PCR fragment enriched for transcripts of high or low abundance from differentially expressed genes. Poly(A + ) RNAs from peripheral nerve tissue was used as template to synthesize double-stranded cDNA. We generated two subtractive libraries: One containing genes overexpressed in CMT2 nerve (tester cDNA subtractive library), the other containing genes underexpressed in CMT2 nerve (driver cDNA subtractive library). We performed differential screening analysis on the two subtracted libraries using tester and driver specific subtracted probes. 79 clones were obtained with a higher expression in patients than in normal, whose altered expression could be consistent with the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease. Ten clones had a lower expression in patients than in normal. Virtual northern blot analysis confirmed that they are real differentially expressed clones. We sequenced all the 79 clones from PNT-specific library and 10 clones from PND-specific library. The resulting sequences were compared with the GenBank database using a Blast program. A significant number of the isolated cDNA differentially expressed corresponds to known genes, other clones correspond to ESTs or STS or coding sequences. Moreover these two libraries were highly enriched in nerve-specific transcripts, which could be candidate genes for other forms of CMT. Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADN-FLE) is included among idiopathic epilepsies. This syndrome, often misdiagnosed as nightmares or parasonnies, is characterized by clusters of brief nocturnal motor seizures with a frontal lobe semiology, occurring during non-REM sleep. ADNFLE is clinically homogeneous, even though intra-and interfamilial variability in seizure severity, age of onset (usually in childhood) and specific frontal lobe seizure manifestations can be observed. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. Three loci, ENFL1, ENFL2, and ENFL3 have been associated with ADNFLE. The locus ENFL1 contains the CHRNA4 gene, three different mutations in the CHRNA4 gene have been described, this gene coding for the alpha subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcoline receptor (nAChR) and located on chromosome 20q13.2. The ENFL2 locus has been mapped by linkage analysis in a single family to chromosome 15q24 region. More recently, a third locus for ADNFLE, ENLF3, has been identified on chromosome 1q21. Two different mutations, affecting the same amino acid residue, were found in the CHRB2 gene coding for the beta2 subunit of the nAChR. In this study we report a new 10-member, threegeneration family from Calabria with ADNFLE. All index patients were screened for CHRNA4 and CHRNB2 mutations by sequencing. We sequenced the exons and the corres-ponding exon-intron boundaries of CHRNA4 and CHRNB2 genes in the patients of the family ADNFLE and identified polymorphisms but no mutations. These data, strongly suggested that CHRNA4 and CHRNB2 gene are not involved in the aetiopathogenesis of ADNFLE in this family. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominant, multisystemic disorder caused by abnormal expansion of unstable CAG repeats in gene located on chromosome 6p22-23. We clinically studied 35 patients from 13 families with SCA1, which accounted for 33% of all ADCA families and was the most common SCA mutation in Serbia. This study was a part of a large effort to characterize 55 families with hereditary ataxia in Serbia. The age of onset was 19 -49 (33.3 \u00b1 8). All affected family members were heterozygous with 46-66 trinucleotide repeats. We found significant inverse correlation between age at onset and number of CAG repeats (r = 0.641; P = 0.000; P < 0.01). All patients presented dysarthria and gait or limb ataxia. The length of CAG repeats did not seem to influence the severity of cerebellar dysfunction. The most common non-cerebellar signs were gaze palsy (53.1%), dysmetric saccades (40.6%), 'bulging eyes', dysphagia (53.8%), spasticity (75%) and hyperreflexion (78.1%). Gaze palsy, 'bulging eyes', dysphagia and diminished reflexes were significantly more present in patients with disease duration over 10 years compared to those with duration less than 10 years. Univariant logistic regression analysis separated gaze palsy, 'bulging eyes', dysphagia, spasticity and hyperreflexia as highly significant predictors of SCA1 diagnosis compared to other ADCA patients.

We propose to identify by a candidate gene approach, genes involved in the susceptibility or severity to MS. Anonymous genome-wide searches have shown that genetic susceptibility is conferred by multiple genes of small effects.

Results: In total 31 subjects, of which 23 were investigated with polysomnography both during baseline and treatment, completed the study. After 12 weeks of treatment, the score in the IRLSSG scale as well as the PLMI had decreased statistically significant in the cabergoline group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.012 and P = 0.018). No significant difference was seen in the ESS scores. TST increased in the cabergoline group, but the difference was not statistically significant compared with the placebo group. No serious adverse effects were reported. Conclusion: Cabergoline in one dose 2 h before bedtime resulted in a significant decrease of subjective RLS symptoms and a substantial reduction of PLMI during sleep compared with placebo after 12 weeks treatment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2470"}, {"text": "Effects of change from daylight saving time to wintertime on quality of sleep parameters in persons with general complaints of disturbed sleep R. Go\u00a8rtel Meyer Psychological Institute, University of Mannheim, Germany Methods: In order to investigate the effect of shift from daylight saving time to wintertime on sleep habits and quality of sleep, n = 30 subjects with general complaints about poor quality of sleep [1] were asked to participate and to document their experience 1 week before and 1 week after the clock reset. At the start of the study, sleep habits, quality of sleep (QoS) and feeling refreshed after sleep (FRS) during the past 2 weeks were recorded by means of the Sleep Inventory SF-B [2] . Each day in the week before and after clock reset the subjects filled in the SF-A Questionnaire [2] and measured body temperature at bedtime and after waking up. Results: 26 volunteers, mean age = 34 years, took part in the study. SF-B: More than 50% of the persons reported Sleep-Onset Latency (SOL) longer than 15 min. 60% of the persons experienced more than one sleep interruption per night. SF-A: Significant effects of reset of clock were observed in SOL, DMS, QoS, Waking Time and body temperature (P < 0.05, Mixed Models). The results are discussed in the context of biophysiciological theories of sleep-wake-regulation. Introduction: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a condition characterized by a loss of REM sleep muscle atonia. Besides its idiopathic form, RBD has been found to be associated with the synucleinopathies. RBD, together with other clinical features (like depression, episodic loss of consciousness, sensitivity to neuroleptics) are thought to be supportive features of a diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In view of emerging evidence that EEG may display distinctive abnormalities in DLB, we describe an interesting case of possible DLB, which suggests the combined role of EEG and RBD in the early diagnosis of DLB. Patient and methods: A 72-year-old male was referred to our department for evaluation of a 3-year history of dreamenacting behaviors. These behaviors characterized by increased vocalization and random twitches and body movements during sleep, progressing to yelling and flailing. Polysomnographic study confirmed the diagnosis of RBD. One year prior to evaluation, he gradually developed cognitive decline and subsequently symmetrical parkinsonian signs in his hands. Neuropsychological evaluation indicated deficits in visuo-spatial abilities and visual memory. MRI of the brain was normal. An EEG showed marked slowing of background rhythm and bursts of delta activity over the parasagittal regions of both hemispheres. Conclusions: Although various studies have shown that temporal slow wave transients or frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) frequently accompany the neurodegeneration in DLB, the role of EEG in DLB is controversial. Our case implies that EEG may further support the diagnosis of DLB in the setting of RBD. Aging is associated with a progressive decline in HPA axis, accompanied by severe disturbances in sleep which may lead to depression and cognitive impairments which in part can be accounted for a reduction in blood flow in the brain. Objective: To assess the efficacy of a 30 min standard physical exercise program (N. Teleki et al. Geriatria VIII, 5, 1996) applied 5\u00b7/week for 16 weeks amongst elderly men on: sleep quality, depression, cognitive functions, muscle strength and hormone axis. 42 elderly aged 65-78 years old were selected from Rehabilitation Clinique: 21 active (group A) and 21 sedentary, depressed with sleep disorders (group B). Minimental test and Geriatric Depression scale have been used before and after training to assess psychological status. Sleep evaluation has been done with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Cortisol and human growth hormone have been evaluated before and after training with DELFIA research Spectrofluorimeter using an FIA program. Evaluation of muscle strength following training has been done with Schwartzer Picker 2000 EMG. Following training there is an increase in HGH and a decrease in cortisol secretion with a positive impact upon cognitive capacity and on depression scores in sedentary patients. Total sleep duration, sleep onset latency and scores on a scale of global sleep quality showed significant improvement. Regular moderate intensity exercise may be a non-pharmacological alternative for elderly with sleep complains, increasing blood flow into the brain, releasing the depressive states and improving cognitive functions with a positive impact upon quality of life.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 416, "end": 419, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 706, "end": 709, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3352, "end": 3394, "text": "(N.

A 43-year-old woman presented with stuporous state of acute onset and sudden falls with loss of muscle tone. She had a family history of presumed nemaline myopathy but never complained of neuromuscular disorder. At the admission the patient was drowsy but not confused. Neurological examination revealed features of MD: distal muscle weakness, myotonia on percussion, ptosis and atrophy of the masseters. The diagnosis of MD was confirmed by both electromyography and molecular analysis. Polysomnographic recording found disruption of sleep-wake rythmicity and short sleep latencies. No sleep apnea was recorded. The measures of body temperature and cortisol, growth hormone, prolactine levels revealed circadian rythms abnormalities. The cyclic secretion of melatonin was normal. Treatment with modafinil rapidly reduced daytime somnolence. Hypersomnia is frequently reported in MD, sharing with narcolepsy a short sleep latency. It is occasionally due to obstructive sleep apnea but may be principally of central nervous system origin. A dysfunction of the hypothalamic-hypocretin system has been described. Actually excessive daytime sleepiness in MD may reflect a widespread malfunction of the circadian and ultradian timing system, as suggested in our observation. This unusual presentation of MD and the presence of circadian rythm disorders make this case original. Results: 46 patients (11.3%) had neuro-psychiatric manifestations severe enough to hospitalization (42 male and three female with mean age of 27 years at time of neuro-psychiatric manifestations). Seizure (63%), headache (60%) and disturbance of consciousness (50%) were the most common signs and symptoms. Small vessel disease (37%), isolated seizure disorder (24%) and stroke-like presentations (9%) were the most common neurologic syndromes. High sedimentation rate (92%), antinuclear antibodies (89%) and decreased complements (68%) were detected in our patients.

Abnormalities of intracellular Ca 2+ -regulation may play a role in their pathogenesis. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome (pAPS) is a thrombophilic state characterized by recurrent thrombosis, recurrent pregnancy loss and neurological features, including seizures. Involvement of skeletal muscles is not reported. Case report: We present the case of a patient who first presented generalized epileptic seizures at the age of 54. Antiepileptic medication with valproate (3 \u00b7 500 mg/day) was initiated and controlled seizures effectively. Diagnostic workup revealed silent ischemic white matter lesions and repeatedly high lactate levels. Immunological screening revealed elevated anticardiolipin-IgM-antibodies. However, due to the combination of persistent high lactate levels during follow-up, silent strokes and epileptic seizures MELAS-Syndrome needed to be excluded. Therefore, 3 months later a biopsy of the right quadriceps was performed and definitely excluded mitochondrial diseases. However, TAs were identified as multiple, subsacrolemmal or centrally located, well-demarcated areas with a fine granulated basophilic appearance in H-E and a typical staining pattern. Elevated anticardiolipin-IgM-antibody concentrations were documented twice again at 3 and 6 months, leading to the diagnosis of pAPS. Discussion: To our knowledge this is the first report of definite pAPS with tubular aggregates. However, it remains unclear whether this skeletal muscle involvement is related to this disease itself or to the only 3 months lasting antiepileptic medication with valproate, which is known to influence intracellular Ca 2+ concentration but not to induce such muscular changes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2480"}, {"text": "Neurological symptomatology in patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome V.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) might be accompanied by elevated AP-Ab under the condition secondary APS. Magnetic resonance (MR) represents the most sensitive method for detection of the extent of brain affection. The aim of the study was to determine the neurological symptomatology in 14 patients (10 females and four males, aged 22-52 years) with secondary APS connected with SLE investigated during years 1996-2003. All patients were investigated by rheumatologists, neurologists, by laboratory tests and 1.5T MR. Results: The neurological findings in our patients were heterogeneous, diplopia prevailed (12 individuals). All patients had a stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Nine patients suffered from headache, four patients from epileptic seizures. All patients had abnormalities on MR -focal hyperintensities in the white matter in T2 weighted images with predominance of the 3 mm size mainly in frontal and pariental lobes. Six patients had post-malatic changes in the brain. The clinical state nor MR findings correlated with serum titers of AP-Ab. Conclusions: APS patients have non-specific neurological symptomatology, which could imitate any systemic disease or simple stroke and the diagnosis should be determined by combination of laboratory findings and clinical state. Their MR findings are non-specific and might only support the clinical diagnosis from typical distribution of focal changes and post-malatic wedge-shaped lesions. Objectives: The underlying cause of ischemic cerebral stroke (ICS) in hepatic cirrhosis is often difficult to determine, since Posters, Monday 6 September these vascular insults are occurring in patients with bleeding tendencies. We determined the clinical features, radiographic, and hematologic abnormalities of those patients. Patients and methods: Forty patients with ICS were retrospectively assigned to either small and large artery groups based on their clinical and radiographic features. Procoagulant (factors FII, FV, FVII, FIX FX and FXI), anticoagulant (protein C and S) and fibrinolytic proteins (fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products) were assessed. The two patients groups were compared and matched with third normal control group. Staging of liver cirrhosis was done through Pugh's (1973) and Sherlock and Dooley (1997) classification. Results: 24 patients (60%) were small artery, and 16 patients (40%) were large artery disease. There were no significant differences between two patients groups in the frequencies of stroke risk factors except for hypertension (higher in large artery disease). Clotting factors FII, FV, FVII, FIX FX and FXI were significantly reduced (mean levels 0.63, 0.67, 0.65, 0.61, 0.64 and 0.50 IU/ml respectively) in patients' group than control group. Protein C and S (mean levels 49.71 and 72%) were significantly reduced than control (mean 87%). No significant difference between the two patients' groups as regards clotting factors, protein C & S and fibrinogen and FDPs.

We described the neurologist decisions and we list the AED prescribed before and after this examinations. Results: 92 consultations was made for 53 patients (32 men, 21 women). All was treated for a primary brain tumor. 36 (68%) had an epilepsy history. 41 (77.4%) observed an AED and 12 (22.6%) had no AED. The three most frequent AED was phenytoin, valproate and carbamazepine. Request was a simple evaluation in 24 cases, persistence of epileptic seizures (16 cases) and lateral effect of AED (13 cases). The neurologist decisions was: AED change (25 times), AED stopped (5). AED was introduced in one case because undiagnosed epilepsy. Adverse events with AED were observed in 13 patients (24.5%).

Conclusion: Management of epilepsy in patients with primary brain tumor is important for many reasons: avoid preventive treatment, detect adverse reactions to AED and choice adapted AED include new AED. Neuroblastoma is the second most common pediatric malignancy. Much progress has been made in understanding neuroblastoma differentiation triggered in vitro by certain agents such as retinoic acid, but efficient clinical treatments are currently still lacking. HMG-CoA reductase is a key enzyme for the synthesis of cholesterol, inhibitors of this enzyme are known as statins and are widely used in the therapy hyperlipidemia. Most recently, statins have attracted significant interest in the field of cancer research, as patients treated with statins show decreased incidence of a wide array of different malignancies. Here, we examined the effect of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor mevastatin on neuroblastoma cells. We found that treatment with mevastatin for 24 h induced neuronal differentiation of Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells grown in full medium, with neurites appearing as soon as 6 h. The morphological differentiation of neuroblastoma cells was associated with the upregulation of neuronal marker proteins such as NeuN. Neuro2a differentiation after addition of mevastatin could be blocked by addition of purified HDL/cholesterol. We subsequently examined the signal transduction pathways leading to statin-induced neuroblastoma differentiation. Surprisingly, mevastatin induced activation of MAPK and Akt, and inhibition of MAPK and Akt blocked Neuro2a differentiation in response to mevastatin. In summary, our results show that a well established HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor triggers neuroblastoma differentiation and give mechanistic insight into the signalling pathways triggered by statins.

Telomerase is a nucleoprotein that synthesizes telomeres by adding TTAGGG to the telomeric ends that leads to cell proliferating beyond the senescent checkpoints. This enzyme is absent in healthy differentiated somatic cells, but telomerase activity has been detected in most tumors. The present study has been done to investigate the level of telomerase activity in human glioma and meningioma regarding tumor histopathology and grading. Materials and methods: Tissue samples consisting of 22 glioma and 11 meningioma tissue samples were obtained from 33 patients operated in three neurosurgical centers in Tehran-Iran. Histopathology and grading (based on WHO grading system) were determined. Telomerase activities were analyzed in all samples by Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP assay). Results: Telomerase activity was detected in 16 (72.7%) of the 22 cases with glioma, but after investigating the serial dilution results of extracts (because of observed variation in TRAP assay), we detected telomerase activity in 10 of 11 (90.9%) glioblastoma multiforme, four of six (66.6%) Astrocytoma gradeIII and two of five (40%) Astrocytoma gradeII glioma samples. We could detect telomerase activity just in one of samples with meningioma (9%). Conclusions: Telomerase activity is associated strongly with histopathological grade of tumor.

Much less is known about the possible effective treatment approaches. We present three patients who suffered from antibody mediated subacute cerebellar syndrome. All of them were treated with plasmaexchange. Objective: To evaluate the yield of plasma exchange in antibody mediated subacute cerebellitis. Methods: Between 06/02 and 05/03, three patients were identified to suffer form a subacute cerebellar syndrome. Serum of the patients were tested for antibodies associated with subacute cerebellar syndromes. Two patients (Patient 1, age 41/Patient 2, age 64) were positive for Anti-Hu and the third (age 52) for Anti-GAD. The Two patients positive for Anti-Hu underwent extensive evaluation for a primary malignant focus, but until today no primary focus could be identified. All of our patients were treated with five initial courses of plasmaexchange following recurrent boosters of once in 2 or 3 weeks. Results: All of our patients suffered from a cerebellar syndrome with severe gait impairment. Already during the initial plasmaexchange course the patients experienced marked improvement, including returning to walk without any aids. Patient 2 did not continue plasmaexchange on a regular base, because of technical reasons. She suffered severe deterioration in her gait and became bed ridden. Conclusion: Plasmaexchange is a sufficient treatment for patients suffering from antibody mediated cerebellitis, including paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome in whom the primary malignant focus could not be identified. Discontinuing plasma exchange leads to further deterioration of the patients in a clinical situation. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive malignancies that arise within peripheral nerves. Individuals affected with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) harbor an increased risk of developing MPNSTs. These tumors are difficult to detect and have a poor prognosis. MMP-13 is a member of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) family, endopeptidases with a potent degrading activity of components of the extacellular matrix. MMPs are of crucial importance in tumor invasion, metastasis and tumor-induced angiogenesis processes. Recently it was shown that mutant p53 (mp53) differentially regulate the gene expression of MMP-13. The tumor suppressor gene p53 is mutated in 50% of all human cancers. Mp53 are usually transcriptionally inactive, however some mutant forms confer a 'gain of function' and can contribute to initiation and/or progression of neoplasms activating the transcription of p53 specific target genes. Immunohistochemistry and/or Western Blot with antibodies to MMP-13 and p53 were performed in 45 MPNSTs. Furthermore the complete p53 sequences were elucidated by single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing. Pattern of mutations in p53 gene were analysed to check the existence of specific p53 mutants, able to up-regulated MMP-13 expression in MPNSTs. Associations within clinical progression, p53 mutations and MMP-13 overexpression were studied. Immunoreactivity to mp53 and MMP-13 was detected in 73 and 55% of MPNSTs, respectively. Clinical analysis suggests that the activity of MMP-13 is associated with poorer survival in MPNSTs.

MRI of the brain showed non-specific leucoencephalopathy and mild cerebellar atrophy. Serial examinations of the serum using an immunoblot technique demonstrated a positive anti-Hu. The presence of an underlying sensory neuronopathy was excluded by a detailed EMG study. CT of the thorax and abdomen raised the suspicion of a malignant enlargement of the prostate, which was finally confirmed pathologically. Follow up examination 18 months later showed stabilization of the neurological syndrome and no further involvement of non-cerebellar structures. Conclusions: Previous literature data showed that SCLC is practically the only malignancy among patients with pure cerebellar syndrome due to Hu-Ab.

The increase of serum creatine phosphokinase without other immunological abnormalities, the nerve conduction study and the muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of polymyositis. She was given azathioprine (100 mg/day) and prednisone (1 mg/kg) with a significant clinical and laboratory improvement after 4 months. Seven months after the onset of polymyositis and further to severe opportunistic pulmonary infection complicated by sepsis, she developed sensory and motor deficits of lower limbs with loss of tendon reflexes. She presented also alopecia and oral ulcers. The lumbar puncture, the nerve conduction study and the muscle biopsy showed signs of CIDP. The immunological test showed the presence of ANA without anti-DNA, and increase of ESR and CRP. Other causes of peripheral neuropathy such as infectious, toxic or metabolic were excluded by laboratory tests. She received monthly high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (2 g/kg per month for 12), the corticosteroid and azathioprine therapies were progressively decreased until 10 and 50 mg/day respectively, with a significant improvement of neurological deficits of lower limbs.

The aim of our study was to perform a hospital-based epidemiological analysis of primary brain tumours in Georgia (a former Soviet republic) and identify factors related to incidence. Methods: We selected two study cohorts, including all patients with primary brain tumours, who had undergone surgical treatment between 1984-1988 (n = 243) and 1996-2000 (n = 543) respectively at the Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery. All biopsy tissue specimens have been retrospectively reviewed and verified histologically according to the 1993 WHO classification of the tumours of the nervous system. Results: The distribution of operated intracranial neoplasms by pathological type between cohorts was as follows: glioblastoma & anaplastic astrocytoma 30 and 29%, astrocytoma 6 and 9%, meningioma 27 and 30%, neurinoma 4.5 and 7%, medulloblastoma 2 and 2%. (cohorts I and II respectively). Among gliomas astrocytic tumours were the most common neoplasms (78 and 82%), oligodendroglial accounted for 19 and 10% and ependymal comprised 3 and 8% respectively. Female/male ratio was nearly equal in cohorts: about 0.8 for gliomas and 2.5 for meningiomas. Conclusion: No significant difference was found between tumours distribution in cohorts. The results showed that socioeconomic factors do not appear to be related with brain tumour developing. Observed increase in operated patients number in recent 5 years may be explained by improvement of the diagnostic and treatment modalities. Background: Only 1% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas have orbital involvement; splenic marginal B-cell lymphoma is also a rare entity among the low-grade B-cell lymphomas. Case presentation: Mr PR, a 64-year-old right-handed retired official, was diagnosed with chronic polyclonal B-cell hyperlymphocytosis with splenomegaly during his first episode of left eye fluctuating visual troubles which rapidly regressed with corticotherapy. Seven years after he developed during a few days period a diplopia due to the right external right muscle paralysis accompany by a progressive decreasing right eye visual acuity measured at 1/10th in 3 months. A orbital cone contrast enhanced mass infiltrating the cavernous sinus was found in MRI and a splenic marginal zone B-cell lowgrade lymphoma (stage IV) was diagnosed by sanguine immunophenotyping and molecular genetics. After three boluses of metylprednisolon the visual troubles regressed rapidly and a marked haematological improvement was obtained even after the first cure of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and fludarabine. Discussion: Before planning an orbital biopsy and so risking visual permanent sequels, the sanguine phenotyping might prove useful even if the orbital involvement is rare in lymphomas, and even if the hemogramme is normal. The PET-scan can also contribute to diagnosis. Conclusion: The lymphoprolipherative pathology is an important diagnostic entity to consider when an orbital mass is found because it is treatable by chemo-and/or radiotherapy. right submandibular mass and skin biopsy shows: LBL. Elevated B2-microglobulin and LDH are found. For tumoral staging he performs bone marrow biopsy: LBL and undifferentiated neoplasm (with stigma of epithelial differentiation) metastasis; and CSF study: protein augmentation, and LBL cells. Despite extensive analysis no primary neoplasm was found. Systemic and intrathecal quimiotherapy was started with modest clinical improvement.

We describe a previously well patient with fulminating disease who was successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. A 40-year-old lady presented with 3 weeks' history of bilateral limb weakness and 4 days' history of bulbar symptoms. Examination showed ophthalmoplegia, reduced gag reflex, tongue fasciculation and tetraparesis of grade 4/5 with hyporeflexia. The patient was febrile on admission and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed elevated white cell count of 40 (90% lymphocyte predominant) with normal protein and glucose. Nerve conduction study was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain revealed demyelination of the medulla oblongata and pulse methylprednisolone was instituted. The patient nonetheless developed respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia and required ventatory support in an intensive care unit. She developed cardiogenic shock and an echocardiogram showed features of myocarditis. She was also complicated by acute renal failure due to hypoperfusion of kidneys. A course of intravenous immunoglobulin up to a total dose of 100 mg was given. The patient responded favorably and became fully ambulatory. Serological testing later on showed that the initial Coxackie B4 virus neutralization antibody titer was high on admission with corresponding rise in titre after 8 weeks. We concluded that coxackie B4 encephalitis may occur in immuno-competent individuals and this case illustrated the responsiveness to intravenous immunoglobulins. Peripheral neuropathy can arise from various mechanisms during HCV infection, mainly involving associated mixed cryoglobulinemia. The frequency of CIDP is probably under estimated in these patients. We report two cases of CIDP for patients having HCV infection. The first case concerned a 76 year-old woman followed for hepatitis C associated with a mixed (type II) cryoglobulinemia. She developed a chronic progressive distal motor weakness and sensory disturbances concomitant with a raise in serum GOT and GPT levels. Other laboratory studies were normal except for a decrease in the haemolytic fraction of complement to 75 U (400-520). The second case was a 67 year-old man followed for hepatitis C without cryoglobulinemia, who had sensory disturbances in the lower limbs. Laboratory studies were otherwise unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid studies showed an increased protein content without pleocytosis in both patients. In both cases nerve conduction studies were suggestive of a primary demyelinating neuropathy with associated axonal loss. Sural nerve biopsy showed segmental demyelination and severe loss of large myelinated fibers as well as some onion bulb formation in both cases.

Epidural abscess can complicate PSI and is referred to as a secondary epidural abscess. When it is found as an entity independent of spondylodiscitis, it is referred to as a primary epidural abscess. This study included 60 patients with PSI, plain radiography and MRI were done for all patients.

In control brain the highest activities of GAD was found in substantia nigra (13.01 nmol/mg/h) followed by globus pallidus (8.83 nmol/mg/h) and hypothalamus (8.40 nmol/mg/h) and a low activity was seen in pons (0.59 nmol/mg/h).

Balance was assessed on the force platform and with Functional Reach Test (FRT). On the force platform we assessed quiet standing on firm and soft surfaces with open and closed eyes, and active standing with two dynamic tasks of shifting weight in various directions, Rhythmic Weight Shift Tests in anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (L) directions and during knee bend tests with open and closed eyes. Gait was assessed with a timed Up&Go test and a 10 m walk. PD patients significantly differ in path length and mean speed in comparison with IPA in static tests on the force platform. Quiet standing with open eyes additionally revealed significant differences in maximum anteroposterior sway and covered area. There are no significant differences in two dynamic tasks between PD and IPA. Rhythmic Weight Shift Test in lateral direction revealed significantly increased maximum and mean anteroposterior sway, AP speed and covered area in IPA in comparison with PD. There are significantly larger path length, mean speed, covered area, maximum and mean anteroposterior sway in the knee bend tests both with open and closed eyes in IPA in comparison with PD patients. There are not significant differences in FRT and gait tests between IPA and PD.

ARX mutations were recently identified in nine X-linked mental retardation families mapped to Xp22.1. Since then, several new families and new mutations have been identified.

Seizures were classified according to the terminology used in these publications, and infantile spasms (IS) were based on the description of typical flexion or extension spasms, or hypsarrhythmia. Mental retardation (MR) occurred in all patients, either in isolation or with autistic features. Seizures were observed with all mutations, and were the most consistent finding after MR. Infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia was an important subtype of seizures. Dystonia and ataxia were associated with a 24 bp duplication in exon 2. Neuroimaging show that affected cases exhibit brain anomalies ranging from hydranencephaly and lissencephaly as well as dysgenesis of the corpus callosum and basal ganglia, or gave normal results. The phenotypic hallmark of ARX mutations was non-progressive MR, frequently with seizures. The phenotypes associated with the most common mutation, the 24 bp duplication, exhibited remarkable inter-and intrafamilial variability. A spectrum of phenotypes is emerging, and gathered from recent studies, several clinical syndromes can be recognized, including: X-linked infantile spasms (ISSX; MIM 30850), Partington syndrome of dystonia (MIM 309510), X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia (XLAG; MIM 300215), and myoclonic epilepsy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Association of ACE I/D polymorphism with ischemic stroke in Greek patients S.

This variation has been previously associated with hypertension, pre-eclampsia, cardiovascular disease and stroke. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between ACE genotype and thrombotic brain infarction in a homogeneous population of Northwestern Greece. Methods: 95 consecutive patients were recruited in this case control study. All patients had less than 70 years of age and presented with cerebral infarction diagnosed using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They were genotyped for the insertion(I)/deletion(D) polymorphism within intron 16 of the ACE gene and compared with 95 matched controls without stroke. Genotyping was performed using a real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach with specific for the I and the D polymorphism primers. Results: Statistical analysis of the genotype frequencies between patients and controls revealed a difference in the occurrence of the D allele and D allele containing genotypes in the subjects with stroke compared to the controls. The D allele and D allele containing genotypes were more prevalent in patients with ischemic stroke. Conclusion: The relationship between stroke and the I/D polymorphism is still being debated. This study supports the hypothesis that there is a positive association between the D allele and ischemic stroke. This association study was conducted using a novel PCR approach with the highest to date sensitivity and specificity, and was conducted in an homogeneous population less prone to other confounding genetic factors.Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder in which a nuclear mutation of the thymidin phosphorylase (TP) gene causes mitochondrial genomic dysfunction. Patients suffer from gastrointestinal dysmotility, especially pseudo-obstruction, cachexia, ptosis, external ophthalmoparesis, myopathy and polyneuropathy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows leucoencephalopathy. We describe a family with three siblings affected with MNGIE. A new mutation (T92N) in the TP gene was identified. Urinary thymidine was elevated in the patients in a dose-related manner according to the severity of clinical disease. Slight increase of urinary thymidine was found in a heterozygous carrier. Brain MRI showed leukoencephalopathy in all patients, however, their cognitive functions were normal. Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated a significant reduction of N-acetylaspartate and choline in the severely affected areas. This might indicate loss of neurons, axons, and glial cells. Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder with variable clinical presentation. Accurate diagnosis of disease may be difficult if only standard biochemical methods are used. Objectives: To evaluate the sensitivity of various diagnostic tests in WD. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a group of 23 WD patients, with a mean time follow-up of 5 years. The diagnosis of WD was confirmed based on a combination of clinical findings or positive familial history; low serum ceruloplasmin, increased copper urinary excretion, Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings presence and increased of copper concentration in liver biopsy. Results: The 23 patients belong to 15 families. Parenteral consanguinity was noted in 3/23 patients. Hepatic dysfunction was presented in almost all the patients (22/23), although only 18/23 patients had some clinical symptoms. 16 patients had some neurological signs, one of them did not present KF rings in slip-lamp examination. The sensitivity of various tests was: 86% (19/22) for serum ceruloplasmin level, 84% (16/19) for urinary copper excretion, 73% (16/22) for KF rings and 96% (22/23) for liver copper concentration. An isolated persistent low serum ceruloplasmin level, with a normal liver copper concentration, was detected in the family screening of one asymptomatic patient, making the exclusion of diagnosis difficult.Conclusions: Several diagnostic tests may help to ensure that the diagnosis of WD is made. Individually none of them could exclude the diagnosis. Even hepatic copper concentration, usually considerate gold standard, could be normal.

Banecka-Majkutewicz, 1 Stroke is the most frequent reason of long-term disability in older people in Poland, and one of the leading causes of mortality. One of the recently indicated risk factors is hyperhomocysteinaemia. Hyperhomocysteinaemia is dependant on both internal (e.g. genetic) and external (e.g. lifestyle) factors. The main genetic factors connected with hyperhomocysteinaemia are polymorphisms of two genes coding for the key enzymes in homocysteine metabolism: methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and cystathione-beta synthase (CBS). In our project, we studied the prevalence of MTHFR and CBS polymorphisms in ischemic stroke patients and plasma homocysteine and vitamin B6 level. Our study included examining 112 patients in the acute phase of ischemic stroke, who were hospitalized at the Department of Neurology in Gdansk in the years 2002-2003, and a control group, matched by age and sex. We sampled the patients' blood and directly measured plasma homocysteine and vitamin B6 levels. We also determined MTHFR and CBS polymorphisms by means of restrictive analysis, and performed a thorough analysis of vascular risk factors.

CMT type 2 is an axonal form of CMT. CMT2 is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. A new locus for CMT type 2, CMT2F, has been mapped to chromosome 7q11-21 in a large Russian family from Voronezh. In this study, we report our results of mutation screening of the Semaphorin 3C gene as a candidate gene for CMT2F. Semaphorin 3C is located within the CMT2F locus and can be considered as a nice candidate gene because it regulates axons growth, regeneration, apoptosis and survival, the functions that are thought to be disturbed in axonal forms of CMT. We analyzed, by SSCP and direct sequencing, all 17 coding exons of the Sema 3C gene. Primers used in this research were chosen from the available genome database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and http://www.genome.ucsc.edu). Direct sequencing was performed using an ABI 310 automated sequencer with Perkin-Elmer labeled terminators. No mutations were found in sequenced regions. Further perspectives are connected with the analysis of the regulatory regions of Sema 3C, as well as with other appropriate candidates located in the critical chromosomal region under study.

This tumor rarely metastasises extraneurally because of: the absence of a lymphatic system, the presence of the bloodbrain barrier and the patient's poor survival. Oligodendroglioma may spread via cerebrospinal fluid or after surgical intervention. Metastasis to bone marrow is extremely rare. We are reporting a case of a 59-year-old man, with a long history of Jacksonian fits, which was diagnosed an HG oligodendroglioma. He was treated with radical resection and radiotherapy. Three years later, he was admitted to the Oncology Department for severe anemia. The bone marrow aspiration and the biopsy showed a diffuse replacement by glioma cells. The patient was treated with CCNU, Epirubicin, Vincristine and Procarbazine. After 2 years the follow-up confirmed complete remission.

Cutaneous Bcell lymphomas are rare and generally secondary to systemic nodal lymphoma. We present an unusual association of LBL with an occult neoplasm, in which the initial clinical symptoms were cutaneous lesions and neurological alterations. Clinical data: A 53-year-old man, immunocompetent, past history of chronic depression and loss of weight, was observed in May 2003 due to: diffuse, round, non-pruriginous, eritematho-macular, cutaneous trunk lesions. One week after this observation he started complains of right facial paresthesias, pain in left knee and left foot hypostesia. Several diffuse infiltrative cutaneous lesions, right facial palsy and absence of left knee reflex were detected on examination. Initial brain MRI: right frontal chronic sub-dural haematoma. Afterwards, right submandibular and parotid painful nodular lesions, left facial palsy, right VI nerve and right upper limb paresis developed.

Method: We analyzed 250 patients of metastatic brain parenchymal tumors diagnosed with the brain CT or MRI scan. Result: The most common primary tumor was lung cancer and most common presenting symptom was headache. Metastatic brain tumors were detected simultaneously (70 Pts), precocioucly (19 Pts), after (161 Pts) diagnosis of the primary tumor.

Occhiogrosso 1 1 Department of Neurosurgery; 2 Department of Pathology; and 3 Department of Neuroradiology, University of Bari, ItalyThe preoperative embolization of meningiomas represents a technique to reduce intraoperative bleeding of meningiomas and facilitate surgical removal of them. This technique however could cause histopathological and molecular transformations in the tissues that could lead to atypical or malignant meningiomas. This paper describes the efficacy of pre-operative embolization in 20 meningiomas treated from 1996 to 2003 considering age and sex of the patients, tumour site, tumour size, angiographic features, interval of time between embolization and surgery, type of embolization, surgical approach, clinical evolution of the tumour and relapses. It was reviewed histological subtypes, grading, mitotic indexes, necrosis extensions, cellular atypias, presence of small cell subclones and complete tumour architectures. In all cases it was reconsidered the MIB1/Ki67 labelling indexes and the p53, mdm2, bcl2 gene expressions. Necrosis were detected in 14 cases (70%) and cellular atypias, were discovered in 14 cases (70%) permitting to classify these tumours as WHO grade I or II. Mitotic indexes resulted mostly <5/HPF (12 of 14, 85.7%). Fibrinoid necrosis of the vascular walls were observed in eight cases. The labelling indexes were <1% in 50% of patients. In the perinecrotic areas the p53 levels were increased whereas bcl2 levels were reduced indicating a correlation between post-embolization ischemia and variations of the apoptotic mediator expression.

Budrewicz, 1 M. Koszewicz, 1 T. Purpose: Oligoclonal bands (OBs) represent the most relevant procedure to diagnose intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis in sessile B cells, which reside in human CNS during subacute and chronic inflammatory processes. To reveal OB origin, molecular heterogeneity of IgG was studied with IEF and extended immunofixation. Methods: In a modified PhastSystem (Pharmacia) same IgG quantities (>0.8 mg/l) of matched CSF and serum samples were analyzed using IEF, in-house-made polyacrylamide minigels (PAG) and applicators as well pI markers. Band detection was performed by immunofixation with anti-F(ab')2, anti-Fd, anti-CH2, anti-kappa or anti-lambda, anti-IgG1, anti-IgG2, anti-IgG3, anti-IgG4 [commercial animal antibody fractions of which monospecificity was confirmed by testing human heavy chain (H) fragments, e.g. Fc, Fab, and light chains (L)]. Concentrations of IgG, IgA, IgM, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, haptoglobin, CRP, complement (C3, C4), orosomucoid, apolipoproteins apo A-I, apo B, fibrinogen and proteinase inhibitors (antitrypsin, antithrombin III) were evaluated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with various neurological diseases (3659 patients with CNS inflammation, 246 tumorous meningeal infiltrations, 5030 of non-inflammatory neurological diseases, 468 samples of control group), to find out if there is some specific biological role of these proteins present. We conclude, that these proteins seem to have specific biological role, which enabled to define their subgroups as inflammatory (immunoglobulins, prealbumin, transferrin, haptoglobin, CRP, complement), destructive (apo A-I, apo B) and tumorous markers (orosomucoid, C3c, antitrypsin). Complete CSF proteinogram comprising evaluation of the functional state of CSF-blood barrier and evaluation of intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins enables to improve the quality of CSF investigation and diagnostics of neurological diseases.

I. Kokotis, 1 H. Skopelitis, 2 N. Karandreas 1 and T. A. Kordosis 2 1 EMG Laboratory, Aeginition Hospital; and 2 AIDS Department, Laiko Hospital, Athens, GreecePeripheral neuropathy (PN) has emerged as the most common neurological complication of HIV infection, and distal sensory neuropathy (DSP) is the most common form of PN. The impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the epidemiology of HIV-associated neuropathies has diminished the prevalence of DSP (clinically evaluated) -in the overall HIV-infected population -from 30 to 10%. In order to assess the incidence of DSP and subclinical DSP in a cohort of HIV-infected patients in Greece (randomized), we investigated 78 subjects, 68 men (87, 18%), of mean age 39.11. DSP was diagnosed by the absence of ankle jerks, the decrease of vibratory perception at the toes, or the decrease of pinprick or temperature in a stocking distribution. Subclinical DSP was evaluated by the decrease or absence of the amplitude of the sensory nerves of the legs. Results: Two patients found with symptoms only, 11 (14%) found with DSP (four asymptomatic) and 23 (29.48%) found with electrophysiological DSP (nine without signs or symptoms). Statistical analysis did not show any significant correlation between electrophysiological DSP and the stage of HIV infection, the immunodeficiency status (CD4 cell count and viral load), the antiretroviral therapy, or the time of illness.

Case reports: A 42-year-old male was exposured to a tick bite in an endemic area. Several days after the incidence erythema chronicum migrans appeared. The patient developed stiffness and slowness of movements, weakness, tremor in the right arm four months after the onset of erythema. Neurological examination revealed signs of brady-and hypokynesia and rigidity in the right arm. IgG antibodies that reacted with the antigens of Borrelia burgdorferi were found in his serum. Epidemiologically, clinically and serologically, the patient was thus diagnosed as having hemiparkinsonism due to neuroborreliosis. After three weeks of treatment with 2 g/day ceftriaxone sodium, his symptoms were improved. Another patient, a 20-year-old male, was admitted to our department with a constant choreoatetosis in the left arm and a moderate left hemiparesis 5 years after he was diagnosed as having an acute meningoencephalitic form of TBE.

Alavi-Naini 2 Departments of 1 Neurology; and 2 Department of Infectious Diseases, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran Introduction: Guillain-Barre`syndrome is the most frequent acute peripheral neuropathy of the human being. A mild respiratory or gastrointestinal infection precedes the neurological manifestations by 1-3 weeks in about two-thirds of the patients. Case report: A 25-year-old woman was admitted because of generalized pain, weakness and fever since 2 days before admission but cough was presented for the last 2 months. On neurologic examination lower limbs' motor function was graded 2/5 proximally and 1/5 distally. Deep tendon reflexes were absent. A dramatic decrease in position sense was revealed. Plantar reflexes were unresponsive. Chest X-ray showed pulmonary cavity in the upper lobe of the right lung. Gram stains of the gastric lavage were positive for M. tuberculosis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal at first but increased protein (75 mg/dl) without any change in cells was detected two weeks later. Polymerase chain reaction test of CSF for M. tuberculosis was negative. Electrophysiological studies revealed demyelinating polyneuropathy without axonal injury. Discussion: Recently, it has been appreciated from serological studies that Campylobacter jejuni is the most frequent identifiable preceding infection. It occurs usually after an infectious disease due to an autoimmune process. Smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis also is endemic in south-east of Iran. Coincidence of both diseases is exceedingly rare. Other types of acute polyneuropathy do occur occasionally and need to be differentiated from GBS. Hypokalemic paralysis, TB radiculomyelitis, Pott's disease and syringomyelia secondary to TB meningitis give rise to generalized weakness and gait disorder. She has improved with antituberculous chemotherapy and plasmapheresis. Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis is a benign disorder of lymph node, which should be differentiated from other types of lymphadenitis or malignant lymphoma. The most common presentation includes fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. The course is invariably benign: spontaneous resolution usually occurs within 4 to 6 months. The diagnosis is confirmed by characteristic pathologic findings of the involved lymph node. The involvement of nervous system is known to be rare. We report two patients with histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis accompanied by aseptic meningitis. In one patient, both diseases developed simultaneously and in the other patient, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis was followed by aseptic meningitis 2 months later. Aspergillosis is a rare cause of intracranial disease in the nonimmunocompromised patient. A 74-year-old woman presented with headache and blurred vision of the left eye. Histologic examination revealed granulation tissue with chronic inflammatory cells and abundant dichotomously branching hyphae (Aspergillus fumigatus). She was treated with amphotericin B. Central nervous system (CNS) aspergillosis is a potentially fatal disease. This form of Aspergillus infection is rare in Korea but common in hot dry areas. Histological recognition of the condition is important and many cases are clinically diagnosed as a tumor and undergo biopsy. Aggressive surgical resection of the infected areas is of utmost importance in the management of this infection. Antifungal chemotherapeutic agents are used in the treatment of CNS involvement and in the fulminant form of the disease. Invasive sinus aspergillosis carries high morbidity and mortality, even in immunocompetent hosts. To improve outcome, the diagnosis must be recognized early, before the organism can invade the central nervous system or vascular structures. Although aspergillosis involving the central nervous system is a rare disease, Aspergillus can cause a wide spectrum of disease in the CNS. We report a case of invasive paranasal aspergillosis with cerebellar hemorrhage. Objective: To compare VEGF levels in CSF, sera and plasma of patients with ALS to those of controls, in order to see whether abnormal VEGF levels could be of use in the diagnosis or treatment of all ALS patients. Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by motor neuron degeneration. Deletion of the hypoxia-response element in the VEGF promoter induces motor neuron degeneration in a mouse model. 'At risk' haplotypes with low VEGF plasma levels have been demonstrated in humans. Patients and methods: Sera, plasma and CSF from 24 ALS sporadic patients, during their first year of the disease, and 34 normal and neurological controls were analysed. We measured the VEGF levels using quantitative chemiluminescent assay on the same day with the same kit. Results: VEGF levels were significantly lower in the CSF of ALS patients compared to the neurological and normal controls, without significant difference between the neurological and normal controls.

Background: A few studies on different ALS phenotypes suggest that they may have an influence on survival. Objective: To estimate the occurrence of 'flail arm' (FA) and 'flail leg' (FL) phenotypes in ALS patients and to determine FA and FL influence on survival. Methods: We carried out a retrospective study on 235 ALS patients who were diagnosed according to the El Escorial WFN Criteria. The notes of the participants were reviewed and the information entered into a detailed database incorporating key characteristics of the disease. From ALS patients only lower motor neuron onset cases (FA and FL) were selected for studying. FA and FL patients have developed typical ALS signs due to disease progression. Results: FA (7.7%) is more common than FL (3.8%). The male to female ratio was different in groups studied i.e. FA 8:1, FL 3.5:1, ALS 1.4:1 (P = 0.028). There was no significant difference between the mean duration of the disease in these groups, but there was a trend towards improved survival in FL (mean 52 \u00b1 28.2 months) in comparison with FA (45.5 \u00b1 21.3) and remaining ALS patients (45.3 \u00b1 20.6). During the time of observation 33% of FA patients and also 33% of FL patients died as compared to 47% of the remaining ALS patients. The Kaplan-Maier curve was calculated. Conclusions: We observed a trend towards longer survival in FL patients only. Probably, unknown environmental or/and genetic factors are important determinants for survival and sex predominance in ALS patients with different phenotypes of onset. Design and methods: Blood samples were drawn from the D90A homozygous and the D90A heterozygous ALS patients and their heterozygous asymptomatic relatives. Primer sequences used for PCR were taken from Human Genome Database (www.gdb.org). Results: We found identical haplotypes on both 21st chromosomes in the D90A homozygous ALS patient, and on the single 21st chromosome in the D90A heterozygous ALS patient and asymptomatic D90A heterozygous relatives of both patients (D21S263-1, D21S223 (SOD-1)-3, D21S63-10, D21S262-4, D21S261-2). Conclusion: D90A is the only SOD-1 mutation that causes autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive ALS. All recessive D90A homozygous patients develop slowly progressing lumbar ALS. No ALS cases among their heterozygous relatives have been reported. That is explained by linkage to the so-called Scandinavian 'protective' haplotype. Other heterozygous D90A carriers lack this haplotype and develop dominant ALS. We revealed the first case of ALS with the D90A heterozygous mutation and Scandinavian haplotype. Probably, in this case ALS developed due to unknown causative factor, aggressive enough to prevail over protective action of Scandinavian haplotype.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion:"}, {"text": "NFH-GFP fusion protein as a tool for studying normal and pathological metabolism of neurofilaments F.

Growing evidences suggest that these domains are essential for the axonal phosphorylation and transport of neurofilaments. They also play a role in the accumulation of neurofilaments following chemical intoxication (IDPN) or during neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Material and methods: We derived stably transfected cells and transgenic mice expressing the reporter gene green fluorescence protein (GFP) fused in-frame to the C-terminus domain of the mouse neurofilament high molecular weight subunit (NFH). This chimeric protein encodes the complete head and rod domain of NFH as well as the majority of the KSP repeats (45 out of 51). The NFH-GFP fusion gene was transfected in cells (3T3 and PC12, with our without NGF), which were analyzed in the presence or absence of different cytoskeleton drugs. Results: Here, we demonstrate that the NFH-GFP fusion protein is capable to assemble into intermediate filaments both in transfected cells and transgenic mice. Moreover its redistribution is altered following the addition of drugs disrupting the intermediate filament network. When expressed in transgenic mice this fusion protein is normally co-assembled with neurofilaments, transported into axons, where it is phosphorylated, and conveyed up to the synapse. Conclusion: When expressed in cell lines and transgenic mice, the NFH-GFP fusion protein represents a powerful system to further elucidate the normal and pathological metabolism of neurofilaments both in vitro and in vivo.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2561"}, {"text": "Motor neuron disease with tauopathy: A clinical and neuropathological study O.

Ono, 1 S. C. Waring, 2 T. Yamazaki, 1 T. Irie, 1 H. Shiraishi Objective: To perform an ultrastructural study on skin biopsy specimens from patients with Guamanian neurodegenerative disease. Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) have been highly prevalent in the Chamorro population of Guam. The cause of these disorders is unknown, although environmental neurotoxins are thought to be possible causative factors. It is reported that Guamanian ALS and PDC are clinical variants of a single disease entity and that Guamanian ALS is clinically indistinguishable from sporadic ALS. Several studies have revealed altered skin morphology in sporadic ALS. Patients and methods: We studied by electron microscopy the skin tissues from 11 patients with Guamanian neurodegenerative disease (ALS and PDC), 11 Chamorro control subjects, 10 Japanese patients with sporadic ALS and 11 Japanese control patients. Results: The diameter of collagen fibrils in sporadic ALS was significantly smaller (P < 0.001) than in the Guamanian patients and controls and the Japanese controls. There was a significant negative correlation between the diameter of collagen fibrils and duration of illness in patients with sporadic ALS (r = -0.81, P < 0.01), but there was no such correlation in Guamanian patients. In sporadic ALS patients, some areas showed that collagen bundles were fragmented and widely separated by a large amount of amorphous material. In the other three patient groups, all collagen fibrils were densely packed and parallel in collagen bundles without any increase of amorphous material, i.e. they appeared normal. Conclusions: It is suggested that skin involvement differentiates sporadic ALS from Guamanian ALS and PDC. People with motor neuron disease often report fasciculations before symptomatic atrophy and weakness are observed, but fasciculation and cramp without weakness or muscle atrophy is regarded as a benign syndrome. A previously healthy 72-year-old man noted widespread fasciculations and cramps involving the four limbs and trunk, with lower limb muscle pain that interfered with mobility. There was no weakness or fatigue. EMG investigation performed 6 weeks after the disease onset showed fasciculation with motor units of normal morphology. There were no features of denervation. Blood tests, including CK level, and CSF analyses were normal. His clinical condition did not change for the next 4 months. A second EMG revealed no change. A diagnosis of benign fasciculations was again suggested. One year later he noted slight weakness in both hands, with fatigue. Examination showed mild atrophy and weakness of small hand muscles and of the tibialis anterior muscles bilaterally. A third EMG showed widespread fasciculations and signs of motor unit loss and re-innervation. Over the following 2 years he developed weak and atrophic limbs, without upper motor neuron signs. His hands became very weak and he needed a cane to walk. No bulbar or respiratory symptoms developed. Clinical (MRC score and ALS-FRS) and quantitative EMG showed progressive motor unit loss during this period of observation. In our patient the latent period between the onset of lower motor neuron (LMN) hyperexcitability and neuronal death is remarkable.

Pawlik 2 1 Department of Neurology; and 2 Department of Physiology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, PolandBackground: Dysphagia and related aspiration pneumonia are usually major handicaps to the quality of life in ALS patients. Methods objectively assessing dysphagia and risk of aspiration are rarely described in the literature. We propose the use of oesophageal manometry (OM), an objective, manometric method for oesophageal peristalsis failure's detection in neurogenic dysphagia. Objective: To detect the difference between oesophageal peristalsis in ALS patients with mainly bulbar or pseudobulbar clinical presentation by using OM. Material and methods: 18 ALS patients with mainly pseudobulbar clinical presentation (PBP) and 15 patients with mainly bulbar presentation (BP), fulfilling WFN Criteria, were studied. OM was performed in all subjects using flexible catheter with the solid-state transducers. Swallowing was initiated with 5-10 ml of water (wet swallowing) and saliva (dry swallowing), and repeated at 30-s intervals. The manometric parameters were measured automatically, and visualized by the computer system. The tracings were analyzed using Synectics software. The results were as follows: (i) PBP: an increase of resting pressure value in the upper oesophageal sphincter (UOS) >45 mm Hg, a wave-like course of resting pressure, toothed peristaltic waves, (ii) BP: low amplitude of peristaltic waves <30 mm Hg (mean 22 \u00b1 4) without any signs of oesophageal motility disturbances onset and during the time of their progression. The details of the results will be presented. Conclusion: OM procedure allows objectively to distinguishing dysphagia in ALS patients due to bulbar or pseudobulbar syndrome, which is important for revealing the cases with high risk of aspiration (PBP patients). Diagnostics of familial syringomyelia is based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). MRI shows that the most common pathologic finding is the combination of cavity (syringomyelia) with Arnold-Chiari malformation type I (CM 1). Analysis of literature estimates that familial syringomyelia is a rare condition. The region of Tatarstan (Russia) is characterized by high prevalence of sporadic syringomyelia. Objective: To study MRI-craniomorphic features in patients with familial-inherited syringomyelia and their relatives in Tatarstan. Materials and methods: We held a clinical and MRI study of patients with syringomyelia and their family members. We found eleven families with two or more members, suffering from syringomyelia. The total number of investigated patients and relatives was 103. Results: Most cases of familial syringomyelia were presented by combination of syringomyelitic cavity with . Therefore, in two families we found two different variants of syringomyelia-associated with CM 1 and not associated with CM 1. An MRI-study of clinically asymptomatic patients' relatives showed high prevalence of tonsils protrusion -44.2%. Ectopy degree varied from 3 to 29 mm. MRI-morphometric study of posterior fossa (PF) square in patients and asymptomatic relatives showed the following results. Decreased PF square was estimated in 80% of syringomyelia patients, in 55.9% of relatives with CM 1 and 34.9% of relatives without CM 1.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2569"}, {"text": "The most common neurovisual phenotype in families was the phenotype of small PF.

Surelova\u00b4and Z. Kadanka Department of Neurology, University Hospital, Brno, Czech RepublicIntroduction: The effect of the surgery of cervical spondylotic myelopathy is not documented in long-term prospective studies. Patients and methods: This is a prospective 4-year-follow-up study of 78 patients with different grade of myelopathy (JOA range 9-l8) who underwent surgical treatment -anterior decompression, corpectomy, laminoplasty, or laminectomy. Mean age of the whole group was 51 years (range 34-79). The effect of therapy was evaluated by a modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system (mJOA) for cervical myelopathy, a timed 10-m walk test and subjective assessment of the patients themselves. Results: The mJOA score did not change, on average, significantly in the whole group and the same was true if the group was stratified according to the age (below and over 50 years). The severe forms of the disease improved significantly over the 4-year period (P = 0.01), the mild forms did not (P = 0.09). Time in timed 10 m walk did not change in the whole group nor if stratified according to the age and to the severity of the disease (P = 0.04-0.94). The score of subjective evaluation did not change over a 4-year period in the whole group, but improved significantly in the group of patients with the age below 50 years. Conclusions: The clinical status of patients with CSM treated surgically did not show, on average, changes over a 4-year period, but some profit can be seen in the subgroup of severe forms and patients younger than 50 years. The most important effect is prevention of a potentially progressive course of the disease. Introduction: Neurogenic claudication (NC) is a typical symptom of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). The aim of this study is to verify the contribution of an exercise treadmill test (ETT) in the diagnostics of patients with LSS and to assess the factors which influence walking capacity. Method: 68 patients with LSS participated in the study. They were compared with a group of 28 patients with diabetic polyneuropathy and 32 healthy volunteers. The ETT was evaluated in all groups. Patients with LSS also underwent a 10-m walking test. Results: The LSS patients covered a significantly shorter distance and the time spent walking was significantly shorter than in healthy volunteers. In the control groups and in LSS patients with no history of NC about two-thirds of patients were unable to finish ETT, especially because of dysponea and joint complaints. In LSS patients with a history of NC, the main reason for premature termination of ETT was the development of NC (70% of patients Case report : A 21-year-old man developed sensory disturbances in the lower limbs within several weeks. He complained later of dysuria and sexual dysfunction. Clinical examination revealed a right pyramidal syndrome and hypoesthesia of lower limbs without sensory level. Exhaustive laboratory data were normal. Spine MRI disclosed a nodular peripheral T2-hypersignal at D2-D3 levels as well as an enhancement of the lesion on gadolinium-T1 images with slight tumefaction at these levels. CSF including immunoblotting was normal. Cerebral MRI and whole PETscan were normal. Four months later, paresthesias in right D3-D5 dermatomas appeared while a second MRI disclosed an extension of the lesion. Second work-up was normal. A spinal biopsy was done which revealed a severe inflammatory process with macrophages and numerous eosinophiles. Tumoral markers were negative in the lesion while no parasite was detected. Additional tests ELISA for Toxocara canis and HTLV-1 were negative. Serum total IgE was normal whereas specific IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronyssimus and D. farinae were positive. Prednisolone allowed partial clinical improvement and radiological decreasing of the lesion. Discussion: This localized eosinophilic spinal infiltration suggests an allergic myelitis after excluding neoplastic, vasculitic, demyelinating and parasitic causes. Our patient presents clinical, radiological and microscopic similitudes with Japanese cases already reported of 'atopic myelitis'. Conclusion: This case highlights the value of spinal cord histology for lesions of unknown origin and the interest of an empirical treatment of such lesions with corticosteroids. It presumably corresponds to an entity never described in caucasian patients despite similitudes with Japanese cases of 'atopic myelitis'. Constipation is a frequent and bothersome complaint in patients after cauda equina or conus medullaris lesions. It might be caused by defective evacuation (somatic motor and sensory lesion), or by slow colonic transit (sacral parasympathetic lesion). In the present study we tried to evaluate the relative contribution of these two mechanisms in a group of 32 patients (26 men) with clinical, electrodiagnostic and radiological findings supportive of chronic (>5 months) cauda equina or conus medullaris lesion. History on constipation was obtained, and colonic transit studies were performed. A capsule with 24 radio-opaque markers was ingested and 5 days later an abdominal X-Ray was taken.Pathological marker count (\u00b15) was obtained in 17 patients (16 reported constipation), and normal in 15 (13 denied constipation) -Spearman correlation coefficient: r = 0.75. Markers were found in the right, left colon and recto-sigma in 5, 15 and 16 patients (mean marker counts: 0.3, 3.4 and 4.0), respectively. Our results demonstrated good correlation between history and radiological studies in neurogenic constipation. In patients with cauda equina lesions constipation seems to be caused by both disturbed motility of the left colon, and defective evacuation, but not by disturbed motility of the right colon. This suggests that in majority right colon might be innervated predominantly by cranial parasympathetic. Background: Decompression sickness may involve the CNS; it is usually characterized by damage to the spinal cord. This investigation was conducted to determine MR imaging showed spinal damage in acute decompression sickness and clinical findings. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 12 patients (male = 10, female = 2) who presented with spinal cord symptoms. We investigated their clinical features, neurological findings and radiologic findings. Results: The depth and bottom time of the dive were 34.5 m (range 22-56) and 22.7 min (range 10-55) respectively. The most divers ascended with appropriate decompression tables. The most frequent initial symptoms were lower limbs weakness (n = 12), sensory disturbances (n = 10) and bladder dysfunction (n = 5). The chief radiologic abnormalities were continuous (n = 3), or non-continuous (n = 5) high signal intensity on T2-weighted images at posterior paramedian portion of the spinal cord, mainly thoracic level. There were no abnormal findings in the remaining four patients and they showed good prognosis. All patients were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and some received high dose dexamethasone. On discharge five patients had made a full recovery, seven had some residual neurological sequelae, most patients except one regained normal bladder function. Conclusion: Spinal cord decompression sickness is a neurological emergency. Early recognition and treatment may minimize neurological damage. Initial normal finding in MR imaging was a good predictor for prognosis in spinal decompression sickness. ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2571"}]}

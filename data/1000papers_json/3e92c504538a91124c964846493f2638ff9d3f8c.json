In the previous literature, as a sign or complication of COVID-19 were mentioned cases of changes in the oral cavityulcers, rashes, and inflammation of salivary glands. The conditions presented in this article are a serious complication of COVID-19, radically different from the usual course of osteomyelitis, in which the patient has a course with a predominance of long-term, chronic-progressive, atrophic processes. Treatment was somewhat ineffective due to local chronic inflammation (pansinusitis), metabolic, microcirculatory, immune, and coagulation disorders in patients.",

In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of the new coronavirus, which indicates its global spread throughout the world.

From 07/27/2020 to 09/26/2020, she was treated as an inpatient at Zangiota Medical Association, specializing in Covid-19, for 2 months for severe bilateral multisegmental lung damage. During this period, the patient underwent operative treatment on the right side with a diagnosis of \"phlegmon of the ear, buccal, temporal and maxillar regions.\" Once the patient's general condition stabilized, she was treated at home. Over the last 10 days, the patient's condition worsened (SpO2-40%), for which she was admitted to the intensive care unit of the multidisciplinary clinic of the Tashkent Medical Academy. Complaints on the admission of purulent wounds on the right face, right side of the maxilla, partial discharge of liquid food from the mouth and nose, purulent discharge from the wound, loss of sensation on the right side of the face, and lasting of this process for several months, acute respiratory failure, general weakness, fever. On examination of the local condition, a fistulous wound was visible on the right cheek and the front of the ear. There is a drip pus discharge, with pus excreted in a liquid consistency of whitish color, foul-smelling. There is partial, limited reddening of the skin around the wound. When the wound is probed, the bottom is a bone and connects with the maxillary sinus. The opening of the mouth is unrestricted, but the corner of the mouth is immobile and is based on facial nerve palsy. On the inside of the mouth, on the right palatal side in the area of the alveolar bone, the gum mucosa is atrophied, baring the bone and molar teeth falling out, the root part is connected to the bottom of the upper jaw cavity (Fig. 3) . Drops of pus are secreted from these regions too. Examination of the nasal cavity by anterior rhinoscopy revealed perforation of the medial septum of the lower nasal passage on the right with necrotic lesions and defects in the soft and bony J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f tissue of the lateral wall. The general condition of the patient was severe, conscious, but in a stupor. Arterial blood pressure was 120 / 80mm mercury column. The pulse was 98 beats per minute and the respiration rate was 25 beats per minute. Bacteriological examination of the patient's pus revealed several types of staphylococcus, streptococcus, Escherichia coli. Antibiotics were selected based on sensitivity to the microflora.",

However, the general condition of the patient and the process of recovery in the local area were very slow. There was an enlargement of the zone of osteomyelitis in the upper jaw, the subsequent loss of teeth, continuous discharge of pus in the mouth and oral cavity. The mean values of changes in the patient's blood analysis are given in the table below. According to several general blood analyzes, the patient had grade 1 anemia, hemoglobin levels and erythrocyte counts were normalized during treatment. Initially, leukocytosis (12.9 *10 6 /l) was detected, during treatment it decreased to 6.0 * 10 6 /l, ESR -decreased from 22 to 3 mm / h. Indicators associated with the coagulation system were normalized, but the concentration of fibrinogen and Ddimer was slightly higher than normal, the hematocrit amount was 42%, and the upper limit was maintained.

On October 24, 2020, the patient underwent an MRI of the brain with angiography (arteries and veins). The examination showed signs of marked soft tissue edema of the face mainly on the left buccal region and left orbit with multiple dilated vessels extending deep into the pterygoid fossa on the left side. Diffuse atrophy of the cerebral hemispheres. On MR angiography, there were posterior communicant arteries of cerebral vessels that were hypoplastic. On MR venography due to hypoplasia of transverse and hypoplasia of sigmoid sinus on the right venous sinuses were asymmetrical. There was noted signal enhancement in the projection of the cavernous sinus on the left. Blood flow in the other sinuses remained (Fig. 6) .",

According to Bianca et al. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect and multiply in the oral mucosa, resulting in painful oral ulcers. They reported 8 cases of COVID-19 infection with necrotic oral ulcers and aphthous ulcers that developed early after dysgeusia occurred and affected the tongue, lips, palate, and oropharynx.

Since there is no standard treatment for COVID-19, the patient, especially those with respiratory complications, is administered many different medications. Continuous use of antibacterial drugs in huge doses leads to the development of dysbacteriosis and candidiasis processes [20, 21] . The literature mention that some microbes and fungi are also the cause of osteomyelitis. In particular, fungal infection, mainly caused by Aspergillosis fungus, has been reported to cause upper jaw osteomyelitis [22] [23] [24] . In addition, the development of jaw osteonecrosis due to certain drugs or their interaction has been observed. Mainly, the drugs used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritisimmunosuppressants, also, bisphosphonates and the use of other antiresorptive and antiangiogenic drugs, a wide range of drugs classified as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, radiopharmaceuticals, selective estrogen receptor modulators are involved in the development of osteonecrosis of the jaw. Bennardo et al. Studied Tocilizumab, which is a humanized receptor for interleukin-6 (IL-6R), a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling, used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis causing osteomyelitis of the jaw [25, 26] . Considering the rheumatic treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 due to high CRP, we can see that this is close to the truth because there are cases of osteomyelitis, necrosis of other bones in the literature [27, 28] .",

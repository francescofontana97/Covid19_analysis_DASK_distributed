The exposure factor is already related to prognosis, so this study would only add value to previously published literature by validating the ALC triage by Pakistan healthcare workers. However, once you have demonstrated that high or intermediate ALC is related to fatality for , what would you propose to do? Will this study improve the way these patients are managed? According to table 1, patients with intermediate ALC are yet treated with non-invasive ventilation at your hospital, so I do not really understand why authors conclude that \"Intermediate level acuity care with minor up gradation by including noninvasive ventilation may serve as a reasonable alternative to high level acuity care in resource poor settings\". Based on the conclusions, the readers can assume that noninvasive ventilation is NOT being used with high or moderate ALC in your hospital (as you present this as an alternative to improve care of COVID-19 patients), which contrasts with the information presented in table 1. Is this an alternative you propose or is it something that is already being used in your hospital, and your study highlights its importance? Please specify better this fact in the manuscript and clarify the conclusions. Accordingly, the sentence \"Intermediate level acuity care with minor up gradation by including noninvasive ventilation may serve as a reasonable alternative to high level acuity care in resource poor settings\" is a proposal from the authors that should be discussed. However, this is not specifically analyzed in your study and, therefore, it is not a conclusion from your results. Therefore, this should not be part of the \"Highlights\" of your study. To sum up, I recommend: -To clarify the conclusions regarding the clinical management of patients with intermediate or high ALC. -To eliminate or change the sentences of highlights that are not directly addressed in your study.",

Otherwise, your study would be analyzing the relationship between the ALC and mortality or hospital length stay, regardless of the disease (COVID-19) and the personal history. If your study focuses on COVID-19 prognosis, adjustments for other comorbidity or diseases are needed. On the other hand, I was surprised by the results presented in Table 2 . How can you interpret the results of p<0.001 regarding the age of patients according to ALC? The mean age of intermediate-level ALC is higher than that of high-level ALC, and those are higher than that of low-level ALC, so there seems NOT to be a gradient. Regarding comorbidities, something similar happens (patients in the intermediate category present higher frequency of comorbidities than patients in the high category). I encourage the authors to approach an interpretation of this fact in the discussion, so the readers might understand these data. For example: this would be due to a low sample size of high-level ALC?

Moreover, the interpretation of the results and conclusions are far too ambitious considering the methodology. However, I believe that this study supports the fact that the severity of the disease by the time of admission and triage can be a good predictor of case fatality in COVID-19 patients in a low middle-income country.

There was no association of comorbidities with mortality in those admitted to low acuity care (p-value 0.05 for chronic lung disease, p-value 0.4 for hypertension, p-value 0.07 for ischemic heart disease and p-value 0.2 for Diabetes mellitus)\" (Page 9, line 19) Thirdly, the cost is an additional important factor. In LMIC like Pakistan, patients are paying out of their pocket and ICU care is significantly more expensive than lower levels of ALC. We hypothesize that recognizing the correct level of acuity at the time of admission for COVID positive patients in LMIC like Pakistan is linked to their outcome as this might be a more cost-effective approach to delivering care with limited resources. We, therefore, aim to determine if ALC is a predictor of case fatality and length of hospital stay in patients admitted with COVID-19.\"( Page 5,line 15)",

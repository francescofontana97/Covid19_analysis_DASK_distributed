A baseline audit carried out on an acute stroke ward at a District General Hospital in East Kent showed variability in blood tests being requested on admission for patients who had a suspected stroke, in particular serum glucose and cholesterol levels. Our aim was to ensure that at least 80% of patients admitted to the stroke ward with a suspected stroke had blood glucose and cholesterol levels measured on admission, over an 18-week period. The percentage of patients admitted with a suspected stroke on the ward who had the appropriate investigations requested on admission was measured weekly. Quality improvement methodology was used to formulate three interventions in the form of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles: (1) an educational email sent to doctors regarding the assessment of patients who had a stroke and admission blood tests required; (2) adaptation of the 'Stroke Admission Clerking Proforma' to include a list of bloods to be requested; (3) production of an all-inclusive 'Stroke Bloods Panel' on the online system for requesting bloods. At baseline, an average of 30% and 34% of patients had glucose and cholesterol levels requested on admission, respectively. These results increased to 43% and 40% after the first intervention; 71% and 61% after the second intervention; and after the final intervention, on average, 82% and 85% of patients had glucose and cholesterol levels requested, respectively. We therefore achieved our aim of ensuring that more than 80% of patients who had an acute stroke had the appropriate blood tests requested on admission. The modified stroke proforma and the blood panel were the most effective interventions. The changes were implemented in an additional hospital within the same Trust. We anticipate greater compliance with Royal College of Physicians (RCP), National Institute for Health & Care Excellence (NICE) and Trust guidelines regarding appropriate and timely prescription of antidiabetic and cholesterol-lowering medications for secondary preventative measures.",

In addition, the RCP guidance 1 also recommends that those presenting with primary intracerebral haemorrhage should avoid statin treatment unless it is required for other indications.

We also included a note informing the doctors of the forthcoming modified stroke clerking proforma. This intervention led to a small increase in the percentage of Open access patients having appropriate investigations requested on admission, however, the results were not sustained. This was thought to be due to the fact that some doctors do not regularly check emails, or perhaps would not have been on-call immediately after reading the email, therefore may not have recalled the information.

This was predicted due to the standardisation of the proforma across the Trust, and its mandatory use in the assessment of all patients presenting to ED with a suspected stroke. In order to fully assess the limitations with the existing proforma and provide suggestions for change, we conducted an online survey among junior doctors regarding its different features. The following parameters of the proforma were surveyed using a 5-point Likert scale: content, layout, design, user-friendliness and conciseness (online supplemental file 2). We also assessed whether it was clear from the proforma which blood tests need to be requested on admission, and whether junior doctors routinely requested serum glucose and cholesterol levels during stroke calls. The results broadly highlighted dissatisfaction with the layout of the proforma (85% of participants rated it as 'poor'), and lack of knowledge of relevant current guidelines. After review of the suggested changes, the layout and structure of the proforma was modified to make it more concise, structured and userfriendly, with approval from both stroke consultants and SNPs. We also altered the investigations section to include a list of mandatory blood tests for all patients who had a stroke, including serum glucose and cholesterol, and an area for these results to be documented clearly. Finally, we combined this initial clerking proforma with the 'First Stroke Consultant Review' proforma, to avoid duplication of work by ward doctors and to bridge the gap between the initial clerking, and reassessment of patients by the stroke consultant (online supplemental file 3). We anticipated that this would result in increased efficiency of the ward round. The new proforma was finalised, and distributed across ED to replace the old proforma. SNPs and ED nurses were informed of the new proforma, and an email was sent to all medical doctors to inform them of the change. The modified proforma was also sent to the stroke team at the new hospital after transfer of stroke services during the COVID-19 pandemic. We had planned to arrange a formal face-to-face teaching session on the new stroke proforma and guidelines for junior doctors, however, were unable to do so due to restrictions on teaching and social distancing.",

The fact that all of the necessary individual blood tests were combined into a single panel accessible with one click saved time for doctors and promoted efficiency. The impact of the educational email was limited in effect and duration for the outcomes measured in this project. Nevertheless, throughout the project we sent numerous emails to staff members to alert them of the changes we had made, which we feel led to greater overall compliance. Ideally, we would have delivered a formal face-to-face teaching programme for Open access clinical staff on the new proforma and acute stroke guidelines, which we anticipate would have impacted on their prescribing practices. Unfortunately, we were unable to organise this during our period of data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, this is something we endeavour to incorporate in the future. We anticipated that the improvements we observed would equate to greater compliance with NICE, RCP and Trust guidelines 1-3 regarding appropriate and timely prescription of antidiabetic and cholesterol-lowering medications for secondary prevention following an ischaemic stroke. Although we did not specifically measure these outcomes, we believe this would be a vital area to target in future studies.",

Although unexpected, this provided us with an opportunity to prove the reproducibility and sustainability of our interventions.

Our project highlights that in a busy working environment, it can be helpful to provide doctors with guidelines and prompts to improve efficiency and ease the burden on the healthcare system. Although our interventions specifically targeted the assessment of acute stroke, they can be easily replicated in other areas. As most Trusts are now moving towards 'paperless' systems, creating shortcuts on online systems can help to improve efficiency and can be especially helpful for the prompt and accurate assessment of patients presenting with any acute illness; for example, a similar bloods panel can be created for patients presenting with an acute cardiovascular event. Further review, with scope for teaching will allow our outcomes to show even greater compliance, and future projects specifically measuring changes in prescribing practices would be beneficial to add to the evidence base.

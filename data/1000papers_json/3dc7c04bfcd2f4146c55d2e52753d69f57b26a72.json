If the stew you plan to eat for lunch has potentially spoiled, could you best determine this by tasting it, smelling it, or touching it? These kinds of questions highlight the role that sensory information plays in detection of infectious agents. They are also questions with objectively verifiable answers. We suggest that, accuracy aside, it is equally important to recognize the subjective appraisals people have about infection detection. The belief that tasting food is very effective for evaluating whether it has -gone bad\u2016 may be true, but it can also lead you to become sick. Similarly, believing that interpersonal indicators of infection are visually observable may often be appropriate, but when incorrect, this belief can lead individuals to put themselves or others in harm's way. In times marked by widespread diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), such beliefs appear especially critical to understand.",

Because such biases reflect overgeneralized perceptions of threat, an understanding of the lay beliefs people hold about detecting pathogenic cues could help us predict when these biases (and their potential discriminatory consequences) are likely to emerge. The structure of these lay beliefs may even reveal theoretically useful insights into the threat detection processes involved in managing infectious disease. Here, we present five studies that help identify what sensory information people believe is effective and likely to be used in the context of pathogen threat.",

Consider the morbidity and mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic spreading across the globe while this article was written. Because of such issues, coupled with the fact that pathogens such as viruses and bacteria are often not directly detectable through normal sensory means (Lazcka et al., 2007; Murray & Schaller, 2016) , identification of the reservoirs harboring disease-causing agents is a critical step toward effective defense. Aside from non-human animals, two primary reservoirs exist with which humans commonly interactother humans and food. These do not always pose disease-relevant dangers, however, creating the need to discriminate between the presence and absence of threat.",

For instance, people exhibit disgust toward foods showing signs of spoilage, such as rotten meat (Curtis et al., 2004; Oaten, Stevenson, & Case, 2009 ), or possessing an aroma similar to other contaminated substances, as with durian fruit (Davidson, 2014) . Similarly, aversion and stigmatization are associated with signs of interpersonal infection, such as lesions and open sores (Kurzban & Leary, 2001) . Pathogen detection is imprecise, though, because infection can present in innumerable ways. As such, concerns about infectious disease predict negativity toward people bearing phenotypic abnormalities not necessarily indicative of infection, including disfigurement and obesity (Ackerman et al., 2009; Miller & Maner, 2012) . Similarly, pathogen threat is associated with perceiving particular facial qualities (e.g., masculinity) to be more attractive (Watkins et al., 2012) , though such qualities do not appear consistently linked with health or immunocompetence (Cai et al., 2019; Scott et al., 2013) . Much of this research has focused on visible cues associated with threat (e.g., . But our eyes are not the only sensory mechanisms helpful in identifying pathogenic risk.",

Many animals respond aversively to infected conspecifics, indicating they can detect this threat (e.g., Arakawa et al., 2011; Clayton, 1990; Hamilton & Zuk, 1982) . Human studies have found that perceivers can use visual (Axelsson et al., 2018; Tskhay et al., 2016) and olfactory (Olsson et al., 2014) information to identify interpersonal infection at above chance levels. Interestingly, however, this may not be true when using auditory information . Further, disease concerns can also trigger heightened tactile sensitivity (Hunt et al., 2017) and specificity (Oum et al., 2011) . Though such findings are extremely intriguing, research on the psychology of human pathogen detection is quite novel, and a number of important questions remain, including the focus of the current research: How do people judge effectiveness, and prioritize the use, of sensory information when detecting infectious disease?",

In moral decision-making, the belief that a person has control over their mental states predicts greater blame when that person acts badly (Cusimano & Goodwin, 2019) , but when transgressions are made by one's ingroup, believing that those transgressions represent global, stable group traits decreases acknowledgment of ingroup wrongdoing (Bilali et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "Given the relevance of lay beliefs for influencing cognitions and behavior, an understanding of the particular beliefs people hold about disease detection is important for several reasons. First, lay beliefs provide insight into the mental framework people use to conceptualize infectious disease, helping us evaluate the adequacy and completeness of existing theoretical models. Consider an example from the psychology of the supernatural. One theoretical perspective proposes that the idea of an afterlife emerges exclusively as a function of cultural learning. If this model is correct, we should expect that older children hold this belief more strongly than younger children, as older children have had a longer period of cultural exposure, but this is precisely the opposite of what has been found (Bering, 2006;  for other examples of this approach, see Fletcher & Haig, 1989; Pocheptsova & Novemsky, 2010; Rozin et al., 1986) . Second, beliefs can influence behavior, focusing attention on certain types of sensory information and pulling attention away from other types (Driver, 2001; Hagger & Orbell, 2003; Johnston & Dark, 1986) . Such biases could lead to dysfunctional outcomes when beliefs are erroneous. For instance, people may believe they can detect interpersonal infection through sound (to preview our findings, this is indeed the case). Because existing evidence for detection does not support this ability-perceivers using auditory cues were no better than chance when attempting to identify whether coughs and sneezes were infectious in origin )-this belief could lead people to engage in social interactions that increase their risk of infection or to needlessly avoid others who pose no disease threat. Research on these beliefs therefore provides an essential complement to work investigating the accuracy of detection capabilities. Third, a better understanding of perceiver beliefs may help researchers generate new predictions and suggest sensory modalities in need of further empirical investigation, especially given the dominance of vision-based work in this literature (see section 3.1 for examples). In fact, given the associations identified between pathogenic cues (even incorrect ones) and expressions of interpersonal prejudice and discrimination (e.g., Faulkner, Schaller et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2011; Park et al., 2007) , data on the sensory beliefs people hold may be useful for targeting effective leverage points for social interventions. Last, ongoing questions about best practices in empirical research have highlighted the value of descriptive work for improving our basic understanding of psychological phenomena and measurements, potentially helping to address problems with generalizability and reproducibility (e.g., Yarkoni, 2020) . Insight into the lay beliefs people hold provides this type of descriptive contribution.",

However, an alternate possibility remains. Perceivers may believe that a given target requires a specific pattern of sensory modality use, regardless of what is being evaluated in that target. For instance, we might prioritize sight and sound when attempting to evaluate any feature of another person, whether that is their infection status, their personality, even their job. If so, this would indicate that sensory beliefs are target-specific rather than evaluation-specific. Study 3 was designed to examine this possibility. Do patterns of sensory beliefs differ depending on the context of evaluation and not only on the type of target? To test this, we again focused on two types of targets-people and food. We compared beliefs about the use of sensory modalities in three contexts: (1) assessing pathogenic danger through infection (people) and germ contamination (food), (2) assessing normative standards through hygiene (people) and quality (food), and (3) assessing desirability through romantic attractiveness (people) and liking (food). Beliefs in context 1 represent a replication of earlier studies. Beliefs in contexts 2 and 3 represent new evaluation types that are relevant to the specific target but do not explicitly involve pathogen detection.

Instead, variation in perceived base rates may be best explained by as a consequence of perceivers focusing on (different) aspects of the situation that align with their goals.

Logically, the true availability of sensory information does not differ as a function of one's evaluation goals (though it could across targets or situations).

Linguistic indicators of certain sensory concepts do vary across cultures (San Roque et al., 2015) , but as far as we are aware, no research has yet examined how these types of variation affect beliefs about the use of sensory information in disease detection, making this a fruitful avenue for future work. This said, we believe the current data to be valuable for the broader literature-most of the existing research on pathogen avoidance and the behavioral immune system is grounded in studies of Western (WEIRD) samples.

As discussed earlier, recent findings have shown that certain sensory cues are effective in truly identifying pathogenic infection. Others are less useful. On their face, it appears that patterns of belief about the effectiveness of sensory modalities only sometimes parallel evidence for accurate identification (e.g., sight is both believed useful and is actually useful, whereas sound is believed useful but may not be; Axelsson et al., 2018; . Little evidence exists to date about whether perceivers can effectively use touch and taste (or other, -less traditional\u2016 sensory modalities) to detect true pathogen threat. As a whole, it is important to know whether perceived effectiveness corresponds with actual effectiveness. A great deal of psychological evidence shows that beliefs may be biased or altogether incorrect (e.g., Alba & Hutchinson, 2000; Kruger & Dunning, 1999; Wells et al., 2006) , and that the processing of sensory content may occur outside of conscious awareness (e.g., Dijkerman & de Haan, 2007; Tamietto & De Gelder, 2010) , perhaps leading to weak associations between explicit beliefs about sensation and judgment accuracy. A comprehensive approach to matching lay beliefs with accuracy requires more extensive investigation of identification performance, however.",

            "text": "Finally, an interesting direction would be to explore a signaling framework considering the perspective not only of perceivers, but also people who are targets of disease detection. In contexts where disease detection has important implications for interaction, targets are motivated to send signals that promote their own goals (e.g., healthiness when establishing coalitional or mating relationships, sickness when seeking care), while perceivers attempt to judge the veracity of these signals (e.g., Steinkopf, 2017) . From the target's perspective, believing that perceivers will prioritize certain sensory information in these contexts may lead targets to conceal or enhance relevant features, from wearing perfume and makeup to stifling coughs and sneezes (see Weiss, 2008) , that increase signal strength but decrease honesty. Such steps are analogous to those often taken to hide aspects of one's stigmatized identity (e.g., Miller & Major, 2000; Pachankis, 2007; Smart & Wegner, 1999) . It may be that that if particular identities are strongly associated with specific sensory modalities (e.g., groups stereotyped as loud or pungent), people holding those identities may experience increased anxiety and thus exhibit counter-stereotypic sensory cues as a means of obviating actual discrimination in situations that evoke potential pathogen threat.",

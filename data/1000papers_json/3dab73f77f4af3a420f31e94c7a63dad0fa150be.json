While some scholars claim that vulnerable people lack resilience, others argue differently. According to Miller et al. (2010) , vulnerability and resilience represent related but different concepts in understanding the changes. In addition, it seems that people can be simultaneously vulnerable and resilient (Uekusa & Matthewman, 2019) . According to Lorenz and Dittmer (2016) , people in disasters are rarely helpless, but are rather proactive and self-determined in finding ways of coping with the disaster, which calls for examining the role of their selfefficacy through resilience. Moreover, researchers note that social scientists have only recently started to conceptualize resilience and conduct empirical research on this interesting field (Maurer, 2016; Mayntz, 2016) , suggesting the existence of a large gap between scientific and practical implications of how to apply the concepts of both vulnerability and resilience . Hence, our study aims to address this gap as well.",

(2005) , wherein it arises from the interaction of personal states, characteristics, and external conditions within a context, it seems worthwhile to explore the consumer vulnerability and resilience within the COVID-19 setting through the lens of SCT. In other words, the current situation offers a possibility for exploring consumers' vulnerability, resilience, and consequent behavioral purchasing outcomes, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic brought uncertainties in terms of consumers' behavior patterns and responses to companies' efforts to satisfy their needs. Therefore, the pandemic setting might be considered an environmental stimulus that influences the individuals' personal and behavioral processes, showing how efficacious individuals might be when coping with a change and the effect of their coping in the retail context. Since a similar framework has not been utilized so far, we strive to fill this gap using SCT and the self-efficacy determinant (Bandura, 1991 (Bandura, , 1998 (Bandura, , 2001 (Bandura, , 2005 Maddux, 1995) .

Adaptations can also be noticed in the rise of e-commerce, which has consequently stimulated Croatian companies to invest more in advertising, with special emphasis on digital communication and social media (Vrdoljak, 2020) .

According to Young et al. (2005) , outcome expectancy and self-efficacy beliefs are constructs central to SCT. Regarding outcome expectancy, people are motivated to perform a particular behavior if they feel driven, while self-efficacy deals with judgments of one's learning and performing actions when handling the prospective situation (Schunk & Pajares, 2009; Young et al., 2005) . Similarly, for the purpose of our study, it is central to reason whether consumers might be motivated to achieve the behavioral outcomes of purchase satisfaction and repurchase if they feel more self-efficacious, that is, less vulnerable (e.g., with the available product promotions, product knowledge, and purchase ability) and more resilient. In other words, would they be more motivated to overcome the pandemic threat with respect to the buying possibilities? In addition, we see self-efficacy as a personal process that can be investigated through the consumers' ability to adapt to the new situation, for instance, by learning about the new means of buying products (online).",

            "text": "Behavioral outcomes (trial, purchases, and repurchase) are an important part of the consumer decision-making process (Schiffman et al., 2012) , and satisfaction represents a crucial consumer variable reflecting how much the purchased goods satisfy or exceed customers' expectations (Farris et al., 2010) . It is important to study the construct of purchase satisfaction, especially when new and potentially harmful circumstances, such as pandemics, that severely affect consumer behavior occur. Namely, during crises, people tend to be more cautious and focus on functional aspects, hence reducing or postponing purchases (Skordoulis et al., 2018) . Other researchers (Skowron & Kristensen, 2011) indicate that, when faced with a crisis, consumers from developing European countries tend to be less satisfied with their purchases and tend to be less loyal to firms they trust when compared with consumers from developed EU economies. In addition, personal characteristics should not be neglected in terms of their potential significance for customer satisfaction (Cameran et al., 2010) . Therefore, it is expected that this study will provide novel insights into consumer purchase satisfaction and repurchase during the COVID-19 pandemic, given consumer vulnerability, resilience, and adaptability. This study will assess self-efficacy through the aspects of vulnerability, resilience, and adaptability. On the one hand, vulnerability describes one's reduced capacity to attain one's own benefits, and it is determined by psychosocial characteristics and contextual and environmental conditions (Hill & Sharma, 2020;  LaBarge & Pyle, 2020). On the other hand, resilience refers to one's capability to cope well with stress or change and the ability to recover quickly from such adversity (Baker et al., 2005) . Hence, all constructs tell a lot about one's self-efficacy. As this study is placed within the COVID-19 retail setting, self-efficacy (through vulnerability, resilience, and adaptability to online means) represents a coping mechanism (being motivated) for obtaining purchase satisfaction and repurchase (problem-solving efforts). In the sense of SCT and SE, vulnerability, resilience, and adaptability (i.e., perception of the pandemic as an opportunity for learning) represent aspects of self-efficacy that add to the personal processes set of SCT. Consumer behavioral actions of purchase satisfaction and repurchase add to the SCT behavior processes set, in which the pandemic denotes the environmental SCT aspect. Smith and Cooper-Martin (1997) define vulnerable consumers as those more prone to physical, psychological, and economic harm.",

            "text": "Consumer resilience can be motivated by various factors such as personal (self), social (family and community), and (macro) environmental factors (Baker & Mason, 2012) , and it influences the individual's emotions, attitudes, and actions (Maddi, 2012) . Since research on resilience is scarce, scholars (e.g., Ball & Lamberton, 2015) call for researching resilience as a key factor in consumption and an unrecognized element in consumer experience. It can be said that resilience research within the marketing disciplines is rare, although this concept is extremely relevant for marketing and consumer behavior (Rew & Minor, 2018) . Choudhury et al. (2019) point out that studies on vulnerability in terms of purchasing decision making are scarce. However, research on consumers at the base of the pyramid shows that low literacy, limited access to information, low information processing, and lack of resources can increase consumer vulnerability and constrain decision making (Choudhury et al., 2019) . These notions indicate the potential negative effect of vulnerability on purchase experience, whereby vulnerability in terms of product knowledge (lack of it) might be relevant for decision making, that is, purchasing outcomes, such as satisfaction and repurchase. In addition, Shi et al. (2017) note that consumers might be vulnerable due to the lack of knowledge or experience with the products, which might result in behavioral pattern changes. Furthermore, consumers might be vulnerable because of their low literacy in terms of purchasing the wrong products and misinterpreting labels, and hence, reduced cognitive resources might negatively influence the purchase decisions (Stewart & Yap, 2020) . Nevertheless, consumer experience and brand satisfaction depend on product knowledge Consumers can become vulnerable because of the lack of knowledge or skills related to marketplace options (Ringold, 2005) . Their vulnerability might occur with regard to inadequate information or ineffective use of information, which can negatively affect the consumption decisions (Overall, 2004) . Choudhury et al. (2019) stress the relevance of the moderating role of consumer vulnerability (as low-literacy consumers, i.e., lacking information) in purchase decision making, which indicates the potential relevance of consumer vulnerability (product knowledge) for repurchase decision making. In addition, as product knowledge is important for the overall consumer experience and purchasing decisions (Fazal-e-Hasan et al., 2019), the validity of exploring its significance for repurchase decisions is strengthened as well. Considering these notions, along with the relevance of purchase satisfaction for repurchase intention (e.g., Elbeltagi & Agag, 2016; Rose et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011), it is reasonable to explore whether product knowledge influences repurchase intentions if mediated through purchase satisfaction. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed: Vulnerability can occur when an individual interacts with stimuli, for instance, within the retail store, during product consumption, and when exposed to promotional messages (Baker et al., 2016) .",

Translated into the consumer/retail context, it can be assumed that consumer resilience might be crucial for one's functioning in terms of purchase decisions and achieving purchase satisfaction. In addition, consumers who feel resilient might be more efficient in coping with the pandemic when it comes to buying, and might thus make satisfactory purchasing decisions. Moreover, as a way of responding to stress, people can use different coping mechanisms and behavioral coping strategies as a way of achieving skillfulness and empowerment (Ford et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2021) . These insights indicate the potential importance of consumer resilience in achieving empowerment in the form of satisfaction in the purchasing context. Furthermore, self-efficacy is an important driver of behavioral processes (Thakur, 2018) , which leads to the assumption that resilience, as a way of being self-efficacious, might be an important driver of behavioral actions, such as purchase, resulting in a certain level of purchase satisfaction. Therefore, we expect that, given the circumstances, consumers that are more resilient might be more satisfied with the purchasing outcome as they handle adverse situations better (are more self-efficacious) and are able to make purchase decisions. Hence, we propose:",

Following the same line of reasoning, although a pandemic situation is a circumstance that cannot be changed, people still need to buy, that is, make purchase decisions in order to meet their needs. Consumers who adapt (resilient ones) to this new situation and make satisfactory purchases might be prone to repurchase decisions. Furthermore, Stewart and Yap (2020) claim that low-literacy consumers lack skills to acquire sufficient performance in typical consumption-related tasks. However, if this notion is analogously applied to our context, it might indicate that high-literacy consumers might be perceived as more resilient and capable (self-efficacious) when performing consumption-related tasks (e.g., repurchase). In addition, self-efficacy and satisfaction positively influence continuance intention (Thakur, 2018) . Hence, it can be assumed that resilience, perceived through determinant of self-efficaciousness, might be a driver of repurchase (continuance) intention. In addition, given the relevance of purchase satisfaction for repurchase intention (e.g. Rose et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011) , it seems worthwhile to explore the relationship between resilience and consumer action of repurchase through purchase satisfaction.",

Thus, consumers' future buying depends greatly on how brands and companies respond to pandemics and help them with this challenge (Tam, 2020) . Following this notion, it could be expected that if consumers are satisfied with the retailers' responses during the pandemic, they might stay with these retailers for future purchases. In addition, a significant number of studies have established that greater purchase satisfaction affects consumer repurchase intention positively (Elbetagi & Agang, 2016; Rose et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011) . In general, repurchase intention can be positively affected by perceived value, loyalty, and customer satisfaction (Al-Refaie et al., 2012; V\u00e1zquez-Casielles et al., 2012) . Considering the pandemic, it is projected that consumers will increase the frequency of purchasing from existing retailers (Duji\u0107, 2020) . Therefore, we can assume that consumers who are satisfied with their purchase from retailers chosen during the COVID-19 pandemic will show positive repurchase intention in the future.

Self-efficacy in this context refers to the consumers' level of adaptability to adverse situations. In our study, consumer adaptability as a self-efficacy determinant is assessed as a consumer's perception of a pandemic being an opportunity to learn new ways of buying. In other words, people tend to embrace technology more than ever in order to cope efficiently with isolation (Wright & Blackburn, 2020) , and consumers who do not use the Internet, have poor computational skills, or are more risk averse might be more vulnerable (Jourova, 2016) .

Namely, consumers seek to change the status quo in order to gain greater control in their lives for both present and future situations (Voinea & Filip, 2011) . Apparently, regaining control in life can be considered a recovery mechanism that might build resilience, while adaptability to new online buying means might assist. Predictions stating that the majority of consumers will continue shopping online and that they might find new online retailers instead of returning to the previous ones (Tam, 2020) can be considered to be indicative of consumers' way to build resilience and a path toward achieving and retaining purchase satisfaction. Given the previous notions, we assume that higher consumer perception of the pandemic as an opportunity to learn new ways of buying might increase the impact of consumer resilience on purchase satisfaction. Hence, we propose:",

            "text": "Empirical research was carried out on a convenience sample of 502 respondents from the Republic of Croatia. The online survey method was used, and the online questionnaire was developed using Qualtrics software. The survey link was distributed through personal email addresses and social network applications, such as WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook. Data collection occurred from 05/25/2020 to 06/04/2020. Although probability samples are considered more generalizable, which is a limitation of convenience samples, the latter can be less expensive, more efficient, and simpler to execute, and they represent the norm within developmental science (Jager et al., 2017) . In addition, convenience samples can provide better generalizability when homogeneous based on certain characteristics (Jager et al., 2017) . We believe that the research context, that is, the current pandemic, adds to homogeneity and provides a slightly more generalizable setting. In other words, because all the respondents were exposed to the same environmental stimuli (the pandemic), it can be considered that the COVID-19 setting is adding to the homogeneity of the target population. Given the notions (e.g. Bullen, 2014; Grimm, 2010; Szyrmer, 2015) that pretesting can be conducted with a smaller number of respondents (e.g., 5-10), especially when conducting customer studies (Szyrmer, 2015) and one-to-one analysis (Grimm, 2010) , before conducting the survey, the questionnaire was pretested on 10 selected individuals (differing in age, education, and gender) to check for clarity and comprehension. In addition, these respondents were assessed as a small focus group, which offered us the possibility to obtain more detailed feedback owing to the questions asked in one-to-one communication (e.g., about understanding the questions and terminology, language flow, clarity of instructions and questions, provided/missing options, and duration). Sentences and options that were initially unclear were modified, presented to the respondents again, and finally included in the questionnaire. To ensure content validity, the questionnaire was checked by three marketing professors who helped modify certain items in order to attain better conceptual robustness.",

This dimension also indicates that consumers' choices are narrowed, and that they are unable to buy what they desire and need to buy a replacement.

This is important because it might stimulate consumers to become more self-efficacious, that is, decrease the level of vulnerability (by increasing product promotion and purchase ability) and increase consumer resilience in market transactions, while enhancing the overall purchasing experience. In order to achieve this, marketers need to be present constantly in the media, that is, communicate with customers via both offline and online channels, in order to strengthen the image of their brands, improve consumer confidence, and provide assistive approach.

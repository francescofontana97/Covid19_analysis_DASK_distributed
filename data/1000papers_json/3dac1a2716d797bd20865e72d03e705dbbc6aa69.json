The aim of this research is to identify the determinants of banks' voluntary climate change disclosure and the quality of that disclosure. Using data on 117 banks from 40 developed and developed countries around the world, we use ordinary least square regression and multivariate logit analysis to show that country-level and bank-level characteristics are much better predictors of bank commitment to voluntary carbon disclosure initiatives and environmental scores than they are of carbon disclosure quality. Banks want to project themselves as good citizens when they are located in a developed and environmentally friendly country, profitable, less risky, and subject to multiple-listing constraints. However, the picture is unclear when it comes to the implementation of rigorous carbon disclosure. This study extends the current state of knowledge on the impacts of size and country-level characteristics on carbon disclosure, finding that size and national context are not independent of carbon disclosure.",

According to an April 2019 survey of French banks and insurers by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR), despite progress in some areas, banks are not addressing climate change and its associated risks with sufficient magnitude or coherence of effort. Some initiatives do exist, including those in, for instance, France, the Netherlands, and Norway. 1 Dietz et al. (2016) estimate the expected climate change value at risk of global financial assets to be 1.8% along a business-as-usual emissions path (i.e., US$2.5 trillion and possibly as high as US$24.2 trillion). Banks are crucial for economic and social well-being, as they are one of the main providers of capital, and they decide what activities to finance. The 2008 global financial crisis highlighted the potential impact of the financial industry on the \"real\" economy and world. Banks need to consider current and future risks where global climate change risks appear to be growing (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014) not only for their own self-sustainable development and value creation, but also for general sustainable development and value creation around the world.",

In this respect, some methods provide a scorecard or climate risk rating and estimates of the carbon impact of a portfolio (e.g., Carbone 4). 2 In addition, regulators and supervisors are considering the possibility of introducing new capital requirements for banks with regard to compliance with climate change-related indicators (Bank for International Settlements, 2020) .",

Rather, the aim is to focus on banks' commitment to voluntary climate change disclosure and, eventually, on the quality of such disclosure. As illustrated by the \"Dieselgate\" scandal in the automotive industry, misconduct related to environmental disclosure can create a breach of trust with a company's stakeholders and have damaging consequences for the firm's reputation and finances. The business case argument for sustainability is that good behavior can lead to reduced business risks, efficiency gains, social branding, and new market creation (Hockerts, 2015) . However, this argument may have to be replaced by the sustainability case argument, which focuses on sustainability effects instead of profitability effects (Shrivastava et al., 2019) . Banks have come to realize that banking operations, particularly lending operations, affect and are affected by the environment (Weber et al., 2010; Rosella, 2017; Herbohn et al., 2019) . Shrivastava et al. (2019) call for a radical change in the criteria for financial decisions, lending, or investment, for example, to include nonfinancial variables and long-term environmental impact. Shrivastava et al., 32) also stress that \"the financial system plays a very important role in the transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy since it allocates funds, administers portfolios, and manages risks.\" Thus, carbon performance and disclosure appear to be crucial, and are becoming management tools not only to address stakeholder demands but also to manage firms and ultimately to achieve a transition to a low-carbon global economy. Carbon performance refers to the reduction of carbon greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement to hold global warming to well below 2\u00b0C and to \"pursue efforts\" to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C (Rogelj et al., 2016) . Interestingly, some countries and regions have conditioned economic support to enterprises amid the Covid-19 pandemic on decarbonization objectives, particularly in the airline industry (Austria, France, etc.) although the United States has opted for the opposite direction. To achieve these goals, carbon disclosure is an essential first step toward implementing a successful GHG-reduction policy. Previous studies show that carbon disclosure is positively impacted by national context, business landscape and nature, corporate governance characteristics, and firm size rather than by financial performance or leverage (Brammer and Pavelin, 2008; Hahn et al., 2015; Grauel and Gotthardt, 2016; Ott et al., 2017; Velte et al., 2020) , but empirical evidence regarding the banking industry is so far very limited.",

What are the determinants of the quality of voluntary climate change disclosure? Using commitment to climate change disclosure and quality of voluntary disclosure as independent variables, we test our models on 117 banks around the world employing ordinary least square (OLS) regression and multivariate logit analysis. We show that country-level and bank-level characteristics are much better predictors of bank commitment to voluntary carbon disclosure initiatives and environmental scores than they are of carbon disclosure quality. This leads us to consider that banks' commitment to voluntary carbon disclosure is mainly backed by stakeholder and legitimacy theory and greenwashing. Banks want to project themselves as good citizens when they are located in a developed and environmentally friendly country, profitable (as in Kili\u00e7 and Kuzey, 2019a) , less risky, and subject to multiple-listing constraints. However, the picture becomes unclear when it comes to the implementation of rigorous carbon disclosure, when country-and banklevel characteristics are much less explanatory. Thus, we speculate that there is a gap between displaying responsible behavior and putting it into practice. In addition, we extend the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of size and country-level characteristics on carbon disclosure, and find that size and national context are not independent of carbon disclosure. Regarding the positive impact of multiple listings, we confirm the findings of previous studies (for the banking industry, see Hossain and Reaz, 2007; Kili\u00e7 and Kuzey, 2019a; others are Ben-Amar and McIlkenny, 2015; Del Bosco and Misani, 2016) .

            "text": "The first concern that arises in the carbon disclosure dimension of CSR is greenwashing, as disclosure tends to be voluntary, although some regulations have emerged, for example, the European directive of October 22, 2014 regarding the disclosure of non-financial information. Mahoney et al. (2013) test two alternative theories on the issuance of voluntary CSR reports: signaling theory and greenwashing theory. According to the signaling theory, firms use CSR reports as a signal of their superior commitment to CSR. The greenwashing theory posits that firms use CSR reports to appear to be good citizens, even if they do not have strong records in this domain. They find that signaling theory is more accurate. Both hypotheses are reinforced by cost analysis, as the benefits of voluntary CSR disclosure should exceed the associated costs (Verrechia, 1983; Caby and Pineiro-Chousa, 2006) . Hahn et al. (2015) provide a thorough review of the literature on carbon disclosure and identify four theories of voluntary carbon disclosure: stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, economic theories of disclosure, and institutional theory. According to stakeholder theory (Roberts, 1992) , carbon disclosure is a response to stakeholder pressure to obtain information on climate change, whereas legitimacy theory (Dowling and Pfeffer, 1975) refers more broadly to society as a whole. Firms adjust their business activities to improve their environmental impact and share this with stakeholders through disclosure. A firm's legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders may be enhanced by internal and external corporate governance mechanisms, like board composition (Velte et al., 2020) . Moreover, external environmental audits can improve the quality of disclosure. Firms seek to enhance the credibility of their reports and their reputation by employing external auditors to verify their environmental data (Giannarakis et al., 2018) . Shrivastava et al. (2019) call for a modification to the current stakeholder theory in response to the unsatisfactory treatment of the natural environment, which is reduced to just one among other stakeholders. Instead, we should \"move beyond the current paradigm and include 2 Carbone 4. 2016. Carbon Impact Analytics-How to measure the contribution of a portfolio to the energy and climate transition. Available at http:// www.carbone4.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CarbonImpactAnalytics. pdf sustainability issues in the evaluation of the quality of every stakeholder relationship with the firm, and between firms\" (Shrivastava et al., 2019, p. 36) . The economics-based theories of carbon disclosure rely on signaling theory. Following institutional theory (Powell and DiMaggio, 1991) , mimetic behaviors should lead actors to adopt convergent disclosure over time.",

            "text": "According to Hahn et al. (2015) , most empirical studies report an insignificant impact of financial performance on voluntary carbon disclosure; little support for leverage; and a significant positive relationship with size regardless of the country, region, or industry under scrutiny. It is less costly for large (vs. small and medium-sized) companies to provide additional information, as they enjoy more developed internal control systems and, as expected by the stakeholder and legitimacy theories, they face pressure from a wider range of stakeholders (D'Amico et al., 2016) . It is noteworthy to acknowledge that none of the investigations reviewed consider the banking industry. However, Busch and Lewandowski's (2018) meta-analysis of 32 empirical studies shows that carbon emissions vary inversely to financial performance, and Nobanee and Ellili (2016) observe for the United Arab Emirates that sustainability disclosure positively affects the performance of conventional (vs. Islamic) banks. Grauel and Gotthardt (2016) confirm this size effect but also show that the national context (i.e., more stringent environmental regulation and common-law legal origin) is an extremely relevant explanatory factor accounting for more variance than all firmlevel variables except size. In addition, they show that multinational (vs. domestic) firms are more likely to report their carbon emissions. Ott et al. (2017) show that the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) score disclosure decision is impacted by the nature of a firm's competitive environment. Brammer and Pavelin (2008) find that the quality of disclosure is determined by the nature of the firm's business activities. Specifically, they find high-quality disclosure to be primarily associated with firms in sectors most closely related to environmental concerns.",

(2020) extensively survey the empirical literature on governance-related determinants of carbon performance and disclosure, their key financial consequences for firms, and the connection between carbon performance and disclosure. Their findings indicate that the determinants can be divided into firm-related (board composition, ownership structure, stakeholder pressure) and countryrelated governance (case vs. code law regimes, degree of legal enforcement, investor protection) variables. Liao et al. (2015) and Kili\u00e7 and Kuzey (2019b) show that board independence and the existence of a sustainability or environmental committee increase the probability that a firm would participate in the CDP but board independence does not influence carbon disclosure. Velte et al.'s (2020) review refers to other studies with mixed results. Moreover, the authors confirm a positive relationship between carbon performance and carbon disclosure, and the fact that carbon performance impacts financial performance and the risk-specific cost of capital. From an internal perspective, Hsueh (2019) shows that carbon disclosure involvement is positively impacted by the existence of senior management positions dedicated to sustainability and the adoption of ESG principles. Furthermore, Moroney et al. (2012) , Braam et al. (2016) , and Giannarakis et al. (2018) find that external verification of a firm's environmental data improves the quality of its disclosure.",

Scoring provides a roadmap for companies to achieve best practices; the score provides a snapshot of how they compare with other companies. The CDP collects detailed surveys on climate change management in business activities to rank companies across four consecutive levels that represent the steps a company moves through as it progresses toward environmental stewardship (disclosure, awareness, management, and leadership). The final grade of letter that defines the so-called \"CDP score\" (A, A-, B, B-, C, D, E, and F) is awarded based on the score obtained in the highest achieved level for each question using a \"numerator\" and \"denominator\" method for point allocation in the first two levels (disclosure and awareness); the number of points awarded to a company is divided by the maximum number that could have been awarded. The methodology differs for the highest levels (management and leadership), as the number of points achieved per scoring category is used to calculate the final score using scoring category weighting.",

Grauel and Gotthardt (2016) show that the national context (environmental regulation and common-law legal origin) is an extremely relevant explanatory factor. Prior studies show that firms listed in countries participating in the Kyoto Protocol on GHG emissions exhibit a higher degree of environmental disclosure (e.g., Freedman and Jaggi, 2011; Gallego-\u00c1lvarez et al., 2011) . We selected three macro variables to take into account the national context: country development, which falls into two categories, advanced (code: 1) and emerging (code: 0), following the IMF World Economic Outlook 8 ; country financial development from the World Bank for 2018 (percentage of domestic credit provided by the financial industry to GDP, 9 following Pineiro-Chousa et al., 2019); and country EPI, which ranks countries from 0 to 100 on two fundamental dimensions of sustainable development, namely, environmental health and ecosystem vitality. From a stakeholder and legitimacy theory perspective, the more a country is developed (as a whole and financially) and the more the national environmental policy is engaged in fighting against climate change, the more banks should be committed to voluntary carbon disclosure, and we can expect a higher quality of their disclosure.",

In theory, highly profitable firms are supposed to face disclosure costs more easily and to have better information systems to address the issue of quality following signaling theory and cost analysis (Verrechia, 1983) . To test such predictions, this study chose four variables for financial performance to obtain a comprehensive picture of financial performance and to consider the specificities of the banking industry: profits on capital (pretax profit/tier 1 capital), return on assets (pretax profit/total assets), NPL to total loans (non-performing loans/gross total loans), and cost to income (total general and administration costs/total operating income).",

Debtholders, as stakeholders, are concerned about carbon-related liabilities, so that they require information to negotiate debt contracts and reduce uncertainty and risk (Luo et al., 2012) . Thus, the higher the bank leverage and risk, the higher the pressure to disclose carbon information and its quality should be. However, we also assume that managers of highly leveraged firms could hide information that could increase their risk profile and create difficulties in their financing process.",

Size (measured by log total assets) is a proxy for social pressure, as large firms afford greater scrutiny and media coverage and higher public expectations than smaller companies (Luo et al., 2012) , which is in line with the legitimacy and stakeholder theories. In addition, larger firms benefit from extended financial resources, and the disclosure process is expected to be less costly for them, in line with cost analysis (D'Amico et al., 2016) . Kili\u00e7 and Kuzey (2019a) specifically show a positive impact of size on voluntary carbon disclosure using a sample of 24 Turkish banks. Multiple listings (measured by the number of stock exchanges where the bank is listed, BankTrack) are a proxy for financial market regulation pressure. Similar to Hossain and Reaz (2007) and Kili\u00e7 and Kuzey (2019a) , we considered that multiple listings should enhance carbon disclosure. Companies must comply not only with domestic regulations regarding this matter but also with those of other stock exchanges and countries. Del Bosco and Misani (2016) show that cross-listing improves the environmental disclosure scores of companies, and Ben-Amar and McIlkenny (2015) determine that cross-listed companies on the NYSE are more likely than companies that are listed only on the Toronto stock exchange to respond to the annual questionnaire of the CDP.",

Similarly, the CDP average score is low, but the standard deviation is somewhat high in relation to the 0 coding for banks with no score. Not surprisingly, most CEOs are men (95%), and most of the banks (68%) are located in advanced (vs. emerging) economies. The average age of the banks is important (89 years), but there is a high standard deviation with very young banks and very old banks. Some banks are listed on five different stock exchanges. We also notice a very diverse financial situation of banks around the world in terms of leverage and financial performance. Table 3 presents the results of univariate linear analysis of banks' commitment to DI. Regarding country-level variables, DI is positively and significantly correlated with country development, country financial development, and the EPI score, which is in line with our expectations, common theories, and previous studies. For financial performance, the results are mixed. DI is positively and significantly correlated with ROA and the cost to income but not with the profit on capital, and is significantly and negatively correlated with NPL to total loans. For leverage and risk, DI is negatively and significantly correlated with the capital asset, RWA to assets, and loans to assets ratios and positively correlated with BIS capital. Except for capital assets ratio, these results are coherent and seem to indicate that a lower level of leverage and risk induces a higher commitment to voluntary carbon disclosure. As expected, age and multiple listings are positively and significantly correlated with DI but not CEO gender. As in most prior country-level studies, size is positively and significantly correlated with DI with a very high R 2 (21.5%).",

Thus, we conclude that banks' commitment to voluntary carbon disclosure is mainly backed by stakeholder and legitimacy theory and greenwashing. Banks want to project themselves as good citizens when they are located in a developed and environmentally friendly country, profitable (as Kili\u00e7 and Kuzey, 2019a) , less risky, and subject to multiple-listing constraints. However, when it comes to the implementation of a rigorous carbon disclosure, the picture becomes unclear. The country-level and bank-level characteristics are much less explanatory. This leads us to speculate that for banks all around the world, there may be a gap between displaying responsible behavior and actual practice. This finding is similar to that of the ACPR (2019) on climate change risk management for French banks. In addition, we extend the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of size and country-level characteristics. On the one hand, most prior studies have highlighted the positive impact of size on carbon disclosure (Luo et al., 2012; Hahn et al., 2015; D'Amico et al., 2016) , including in the banking industry (Kili\u00e7 and Kuzey (2019a) . On the other hand, Grauel and Gotthardt (2016) show that the national context is an extremely relevant explanatory factor, accounting for more variance than all firmlevel variables except size. Our contribution to the literature shows that size and national context are not totally independent of carbon disclosure. Whatever the dependent variable (commitment, quality, or CDP score), the impact of size varies according to the national context in terms of development (general and financial) and sustainability environment. Specifically, social pressure is higher for large banks in less advanced countries. We also confirm the findings of previous studies regarding multiple listings, which positively impact bank commitment, disclosure quality, and CDP score (for the banking industry, see Hossain and Reaz, 2007; Kili\u00e7 and Kuzey, 2019a ; others include Del Bosco and Misani, 2016; Ben-Amar and McIlkenny, 2015) .

Greenwashing is often seen as the main explanation for banks' disclosure policy and, in this respect, we clearly identify a spillover effect but no more so than in other industries. Nowadays, most banks have developed CSR programs and compare themselves on different metrics, of which climate change and climatic risk are currently the most important. Banks monitor all official commitments signed by their counterparts, thereby creating a competition in the market. For example, BNP-Paribas in France is signing almost all commitments for carbon footprint and climate change disclosure. On the contrary, some banks have signed only two or three such agreements. In some cases, banks have developed specific skills to prove that they comply with these new requirements. Listed banks are more engaged in this process than unlisted banks due to pressure from financial markets that are very sensitive to banks' CSR commitment. To further assess the actual integration of these principles into strategic and managerial decisions, we need a case-by-case analysis for evidence that the commitments are clearly different from greenwashing. In fact, some banks have introduced criteria related to climate change in the selection process of projects for financing. 10 To introduce a more objective external evaluation of banks' involvement, there is an urgent need for new standards in the specific area of climate change or climate risk and more generally sustainable finance or social impact. The European green deal of January 2020 introduces a new taxonomy to identify six environmental objectives to support (and a new regulatory proposal to integrate) the 2050 carbon neutrality targets or the revision of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive. The Covid-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis has led to the postponement of the publication of these new requirements for a few months.",

In fact, regulation implementation has had a visible effect on credit policies in such areas as credit risk management (Erdin\u00e7 and Gurov, 2016) and, more generally, capital requirements (Fraisse et al., 2017 ). An effective tool beyond voluntary compliance would be to introduce new requirements for the issuing of climate risk when banks support investment that would likely have a negative impact on the climate (brown vs. green investment). Although the number of commitments by a bank does not necessarily mean more concrete involvement in CSR and climate change issues, evaluation of these strategies could lead to a discussion of their impact on the performance of banks and the influence of CSR involvement on the overall performance of these companies. There is not much research on the trade-off between environmental or climate performance and economic performance. In the banking industry, some research has concluded that there is no trade-off between social and economic efficiency (Leire et al., 2018) . There is also no clear evidence of a positive relationship between environmental and economic performance. It seems that the conflict between economic and social efficiencies, considered as one of the main obstacles to the applicability of the stakeholder theory, is not inevitable. However, there is no evidence of correlation between economic and social efficiencies. This remains a question for future research.",

            "text": "Investors are paying more attention to climate change. In 2015, France became the first country to impose legal requirements for climate reporting on institutional investors and asset managers and to create broader early momentum for disclosing climate-related risks among financial institutions. Five years later, such legal impositions have been translated into many other pieces of legislation. Consequently, investors and banks are increasingly asking companies to disclose more information about climate change risks so that they can be taken into account financially. Concern has been expressed that banks are placing stress on the private sector to commit to new obligations that limit the \"tragedy of the horizon\" characterized by inadequate and tardy action. The contribution of our study is to empirically analyze the disclosure practices in the banking industry at an international level using specific data on 40 countries. Our objective is to identify specific determinants of banks' commitment to climate change initiatives and voluntary disclosure quality to assess the different hypotheses on banks' motivations and strategies. Our contribution is topical and original, as we focus on recent data on more than 100 banking institutions in 40 developing and developed countries. One of the main findings of our study is that bank strategies and economic and financial patterns of the country in which the banks operate exert a high impact on the extent and the quality of banks' climate change-related disclosures. The implications seem to be clear in a context of increasing attention on the financial industry as a whole and the activities it finances. To achieve high transparency and quality disclosure, as well as to enhance investors' and depositors' confidence in financial institutions, it seems necessary for governments and public opinion to pressure the banking industry to ensure that its communication efforts are as effective as possible and not only related to minimum benchmarking, notably in most developed countries. Providing voluntary information appears to be necessary for banks to survive in a very competitive environment in which online banking is growing fast. However, such disclosure would be insufficient if banks were likely to use voluntary disclosure for marketing reasons.",

Unfortunately, the specific nature of our sample of 117 banks in 40 countries does not allow us to gather reliable data in this regard. This is very clearly a promising path for future research. Second, we rely on cross-sectional data instead of longitudinal data, which limits the scope of our results. Our choice is informed by the lack of reliable and sufficiently extensive history on CDP data, but as time goes by, this problem should be solved for future research. ",

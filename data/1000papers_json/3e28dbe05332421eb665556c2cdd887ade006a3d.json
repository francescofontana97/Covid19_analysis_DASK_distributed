Niclosamide, a poorly water-soluble drug, is an interesting drug candidate because it was approved over 60 years ago for use as an anthelmintic medication, but recent studies demonstrated its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral with pharmacological effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. TFF was used to develop a niclosamide inhalation powder composition that exhibited acceptable aerosol performance with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 86.0% and a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.11 \u00b5m and 2.84, respectively. This formulation not only proved to be safe after an acute threeday, multi-dose tolerability and exposure study in rats as evidenced by histopathology analysis, and also was able to achieve lung concentrations above the required IC 90 levels for at least 24 h after a single administration in a Syrian hamster model. To conclude, we successfully developed a niclosamide dry powder inhalation that overcomes niclosamide's limitation of poor oral bioavailability by targeting the drug directly to the primary site of infection, the lungs.",

More recently, in 2019, niclosamide was shown to inhibit the viral replication of MERS-CoV by more than a 1000-fold by interfering in pathways related to the proteasome and autophagy mechanisms (Gassen et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020) . Now, in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, niclosamide has shown very promising effectiveness against the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 with a reported IC 50 of 0.28 \u00b5M (~91.56 ng/mL) by similar reported mechanisms of action as that reported for SARS-CoV, and the mechanisms of anti-viral activity may include potentially direct intermolecular interactions between the drug and SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Jeon et al., 2020; Pindiprolu and Pindiprolu, 2020; Romani et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . Based on the data reported by Jeon et al., Arshad et al. (2020) estimated an IC 90 of 153.7 ng/mL for niclosamide (Arshad et al., 2020) .

However, SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the pulmonary airways; the virus has a tropism towards alveolar macrophages and pneumocytes (type I and II) . Here the virus leads to breathing difficulties, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, among other complications (Damiani et al., 2021; Guan et al., 2020) .

The TFF-processed powders generally are low-density, brittle, and porous matrices with excellent aerosol performance (Beinborn et al., 2012) . The TFF technology generates these powders by fast supercooling of drug-carrier solutions (sometimes suspensions) (Moon et al., 2019) . The frozen material then is lyophilized to remove the employed solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, 1,4 dioxane, tert-butanol or water). TFF technology has proven to be useful in generating powders for delivery by DPI, and currently, there are two formulations in phase I clinical trials (i.e., voriconazole and tacrolimus) using this established technology (AboulFotouh et al., 2020; Almansour et al., 2020; Mattes, n.d.; Sagan, n.d.) . For these reasons, the development of an inhaled niclosamide powder by TFF is hypothesized to offer a new therapeutic option and route of administration in the fight against COVID-19.",

Thereafter, the mixed solution was applied as drops onto a rotating cryogenically cooled drum at cooled to -120 \u00b0C. The frozen solids were collected with liquid nitrogen and stored in a -80\u00b0C freezer before lyophilization. The lyophilization was performed in a SP VirTis Advantage Pro shelf lyophilizer (SP Industries, Inc., Warminster, PA, USA). The primary drying process was at \u221240 \u00b0C for 20 h, and then, the temperature was linearly increased to 25 \u00b0C over 20 h, followed by holding the temperature at 25 \u00b0C for 20 h. The pressure was maintained at 100 mTorr during the lyophilization process. The dry powder inhaler device RS00 (Plastiape\u00ae, Osnago, Italy) was used for dispersing the powder through the USP induction port with a total flow rate of 58 L/min for 4.1 s per each actuation corresponding to a 4 kPa pressure drop across the device and a total flow volume of 4 L. To avoid particle bounce, a solution of polysorbate 20 in methanol at 1.5% (w/v) was applied and dried onto the NGI collection plates to coat their surface. The pre-separator was not used in this analysis. After dispersal, the powder was extracted from the stages using a mixture of water/acetonitrile (20:80 v/v). Then, the samples were analyzed by HPLC described below. The analysis was conducted three times (n=3).",

In general, it was not possible to detect the diffraction peak or thermal events from leucine because it was present in low amounts (< 5%) (Newman et al., 2015) . In the case of mannitol, the TFF process generated a mixture of polymorphs in which patterns of \u03b4-mannitol and \u03b2-mannitol were observed (Cares-Pacheco et al., 2014) . The TFF-mannitol was used as reference material, as shown in Figure   2B . In the DSC, a transition was observed between 110-140\u00b0C, which was previously reported by Peters et al. (2016) and Burger et al. (2000) (Burger et al., 2000; Peters et al., 2016) . This endothermic transition is related to the conversion of \u03b4-mannitol into endothermic \u03b1-, \u03b2 or eutectic combinations of both polymorphs of mannitol, followed by melting at ~172 \u00b0C. It is important to mention that depending on the freezing/drying conditions and the presence of other excipients, different polymorphs of mannitol and its mixtures can be generated (Liao et al., 2007; Mehta et al., 2013) .",

(2006) reported a T 1/2 of 6.0 \u00b1 0.8 h for solubilized niclosamide after oral administration (Chang et al., 2006) . Based on the measured niclosamide concentrations in Sprague-Dawley rat plasma from Table 4 after 24 h following administration, which was approximately four times the reported half-life, the pulmonary administration appears to have made a difference in systemic exposure kinetics since it was possible to detect and quantify niclosamide in rat plasma at 24 h following dosing. Moreover, our group recently reported that the oral administration of niclosamide suspension had a T 1/2 of approximately 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 h in Wistar rats (Jara et al., 2021) . The observed difference in systemic exposure kinetics may be attributed to an extended residence time in the lung resulting from the avoidance of the extensive first-pass effect that niclosamide undergoes after oral administration . Despite the fact that some drug remains in the plasma, limited niclosamide concentrations in lung tissue following three consecutive days of daily dosing were observed (Table 4) . Costabile et al. 2015 performed an acute lung toxicity study of niclosamide nanosuspensions (containing mannitol) in Wistar rats (200 and 220 g). They did not report acute toxicity after intratracheal administration of the niclosamide nanosuspension at doses ranging from 10 to 100 \u00b5g per animal (Costabile et al., 2015) . In our work, the Sprague-Dawley rats (252.4 -279.5 g) were administered 200 \u00b5g/rat daily for three days, and some signs of mild to moderate inflammation were observed. The mild to moderate inflammation of the bronchioles along with the presence of eosinophils at this dose is a promising sign and currently unclear if these observations result from niclosamide or the mannitol excipient in the formulation, which is reported to cause bronchospasm when administered at high milligram doses in humans (Sahakijpijarn et al., 2020) .",

The Syrian golden hamster model is relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a complete pharmacokinetic analysis is required in order to evaluate the proper dosing for further efficacy studies Imai et al., 2020) . The hamsters were administered niclosamide inhalation powder prepared at a lower niclosamide concentration in order to have a dose of 145 and 290 \u00b5g/kg niclosamide. As can be seen in Figure 5 , there was fast absorption of niclosamide that was rapidly cleared to steady low levels; in general, this is considered an advantage of inhaled drug products in terms of safety and reduction of systemic side effects (Borghardt et al., 2015) . A noncompartmental analysis of the plasma data was performed; the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Table 5 . This analysis showed dose proportionality between the doses as evidenced by the AUC/dose of both administered doses are similar (8.6 and 8.4), and clearance was in the range of ~116-119 mL/h. All hamsters survived between administration and sample collection. Furthermore, in the lung tissue ( Figure 6 ), a similar trend was observed, and the steady-state level of niclosamide exceeded the IC 50 for at least 24 h. Unfortunately, the lung concentration profile was not possible to determine using the non-compartmental analysis model, probably due to the inability to observe the elimination phase of niclosamide in lung tissue between 4 and 24 h.",

After the 2 h measurement, the plasma concentration remained relatively constant, but there was a notable difference in the concentrations achieved by the two different administered doses in terms of the concentrations reached in the lungs after 2 h. Unexpectedly, the lower administered dose had a higher AUC 0-24 h without achieving a higher C max . We hypothesize that the administration of a higher dose of powder caused a change in aerosolization properties from the dry powder insufflator used to administer the dose of powder to the hamsters. Molina et al. (2016) compared different methods of pulmonary administration of nanoparticles, and they found that with dry powder insufflation, the nanoparticles were cleared faster from the respiratory tract because the powder was deposited in the larger airways and trachea with higher variability among the animals (i.e., 188%). Moreover, they detected higher amounts of their formulation in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting mucociliary clearance from the upper respiratory tract. They speculated that the deposition in the trachea was related to issues in the synchronization between the insufflation and the inhalation cycle of the animals and not due to properties of the drug (Molina et al., 2016) . The work of Duret et al. (2012) confirms that the DP-4M\u00ae insufflator (used in this study) is reliable for delivering different drug doses of the same powder in mice, but unfortunately, in their work, the animals were immediately sacrificed to measure drug deposition (Duret et al., 2012) . So, no relationship between deposition in different regions of the lungs and their effect on pharmacokinetics was established. Moreover, Hoppentocht et al. (2014) proved that the insufflator is not consistent or efficient in deaggregating powders using 200 \u00b5L of air pulsed at different doses (Hoppentocht et al., 2014) .",

This is because changes in powder deposition caused by the insufflator can lead to different emitted particle sizes from the device and subsequent different dissolution/solubility of the emitted particles, mechanisms of clearance, and drug permeation (Bhagwat et al., 2017) . The C max of niclosamide following dosing by insufflation to the lungs is nearly doubled as the dose was doubled, which agrees with the studies that showed that the insufflator is reliable for delivering the loaded dose. (Duret et al., 2012) However, it is known that particles deposited in the trachea and larger airways are cleared faster. (Tonnis et al., 2014) This is supported by the plasma AUC 0-24 h that was more than double when the dose was doubled.",

(2018) used the coefficient C lung /C plasma to describe the biodistribution of an itraconazole dry powder inhalation product in a pharmacokinetic study (Huang et al., 2018) . Due to the differences in concentrations from Huang et al., we used the reciprocal coefficient, C plasma /C lung to describe the distribution between plasma and lungs, aiming to facilitate the comparison of niclosamide's lung-plasma distribution achieved by both doses. In an ideal scenario, the C plasma /C lung ratio should remain mostly unchanged if the deposition pattern is consistent between doses. As can be seen in Figure 7 , niclosamide inhalation powder behaves differently after being administered at two different dose amounts to the hamsters; a greater amount of the drug was detected in plasma than in lungs after increasing the administered dose (higher C plasma /C lung ). This supports our argument that at the higher dose amounts loaded and delivered from the dry powder insufflator, the insufflated powder was likely deposited in the larger airways, which can impact the pharmacokinetics of the administered dry powder by increasing the clearance of particles (Kukut Hatipoglu et al., 2018) . The concentrations achieved after the 2 h measurement can be related to the smaller particle size fraction of niclosamide inhalation powder. It has been described that smaller particles are able to reach the deep lungs,",

Lu et al., 2016) . In general, niclosamide's phenol group is the primary target for glucuronidation in the liver and intestine, which is the main metabolic pathway limiting its repurposing Mook et al., 2015) . Chen et al. (1998) reported that CYPA1 enzymes are present in hamster's lungs and liver. They speculated that the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are mainly present in the lungs and the liver, respectively (Chen et al., 1998) . In humans, the CYP1A2 enzyme is mainly located in the liver and has 90-fold higher metabolic activity catalyzing the hydroxylation of niclosamide than the CYP1A1 enzyme, which is located in extrahepatic sites (e.g., the lungs). Moreover, Lu et al. (2016) could not measure the metabolic parameters of CYP1A1 because of its low metabolic activity (Lu et al., 2016; Yj et al., 2021) . In the case of UGT1A1, Ohno and Nakajin (2009) were unable to quantify the enzyme in human lungs, which is abundant in the human liver and small intestine (Ohno and Nakajin, 2009 ). Unfortunately, we could not find evidence in the literature about the different forms of UGTs in hamster's organs. In summary, the main mechanisms of clearance for niclosamide inhalation powder are those related to the initial removal of the particles (e.g., mucociliary clearance). It seems that niclosamide's metabolization in the lungs of hamsters is limited due to the affinity of the enzymes towards the drug, explaining why the concentration was relatively constant after 8 h (Figure 6 ).",

It is relevant and informative to compare our results to pharmacokinetic studies reported that delivered niclosamide by other routes of administration and animal model. Ye et al. (2015) administered niclosamide intravenously (2 mg/Kg) through the jugular vein to Sprague-Dawley rats using a mixture of solvents and measured the drug's biodistribution in the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and intestines. The concentration in the lungs and heart were consistently the lowest based on intravenous delivery (Ye et al., 2015) . Tao et al. (2014) reported the concentrations of niclosamide in male C57BL/6J mice after oral administration of niclosamide ethanolamine at 40 mg/Kg. In their work, the lung concentrations following oral administration were decreased from 87.2 \u00b1 70, 23.8 \u00b1 13, and 13.3\u00b1 5 ng/g at 2, 4, and 8 h, respectively. Interestingly, the ethanolamine salt form of niclosamide mainly distributed to the liver, and higher levels of metabolites were detected in the kidneys. Therefore, neither intravenously administered niclosamide nor orally administered niclosamide ethanolamine provided therapeutically relevant lung levels of niclosamide, thus emphasizing the importance of the inhaled route of administration of niclosamide directly to the lungs for lung infections like SARS-CoV-2.",

The development of niclosamide inhalation powder avoids first-pass metabolism and reduces the exposure of the drug to being metabolized by hydroxylation and glucuronidation (Lu et al., 2016) . Finally, in further considering administration to infected patients, the inhaled niclosamide powder should also achieve concentrations above the IC 90 . In our hamster studies, we administered a TFF inhaled powder formulation containing a reduced amount of niclosamide (i.e., 1.66% (w/w) dosed at 145 and 290 \u00b5g/Kg to hamsters compared to 22% (w/w) dosed at 827.22 \u00b5g/Kg to rats).

To be truly useful as a therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2, the niclosamide inhalation powder should achieve a concentration higher than 0.154 \u00b5g/g, assuming that the wet tissue has a density of 1 g/mL (assumed to be equal to the density of water). We exceeded this concentration in lung tissue using both administered doses by more than 2-fold over the 24 h period (the lower dose was ~15-fold) as seen in Table 6 . Further supporting our analysis, comparisons with the report of Gassen et al. (2020) is helpful. The paper reports an IC 50 of 55.6 ng/mL (0.17 \u00b5M) (Gassen et al., 2020) . Therefore, niclosamide inhalation powder is also above this concentration. Additionally, the toxicology studies support that niclosamide inhalation powder has a sufficient safety margin for dose adjustment, thus allowing for a once per day inhalation therapy.",

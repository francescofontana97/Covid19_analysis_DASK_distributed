CRISPR-based diagnostics that utilize RNA and DNA-targeting enzymes can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable and accurate. Here we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a-based mobile phone assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA extracts. The assay achieved ~100 copies/\u00b5L sensitivity in under 30 minutes and accurately detected a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 minutes. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity, and we directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics.",

Based on primers directed against the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E) , and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) genes, RT-qPCR has an analytical limit of detection (LOD) of 1,000 viral RNA copies/mL (1 copy/\u00b5L) (Vogels et al., 2020) . However, recent modeling of viral dynamics suggests that frequent testing with a fast turn-around time is required to break the current pandemic (Larremore et al., 2020) . Notably, the model ranked sensitivity of the test as a lower priority, and estimated that an LOD of 100,000 copies/mL (100 copies/\u00b5L) would be sufficient for screening (Larremore et al., 2020) . In clinical studies, when the viral load drops below a million copies/mL (1,000 copies/\u00b5L), few infectious particles are detected and consequently the risk of viral transmission is low (La Scola et al., 2020; Quicke et al., 2020; Wolfel et al., 2020) . Since the high sensitivity of RT-qPCR may pick up RNAs freed by infected and dead cells after infectious particles have waned, use of qPCR for screening may lead to unnecessary isolation of individuals that are SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive but no longer infectious (Alexandersen et al., 2020) .",

To achieve high sensitivity, current CRISPR diagnostic (CRISPR Dx) strategies rely on pre-amplification of target RNA for subsequent detection by a Cas protein. In the case of the RNAsensing Cas13 proteins, this typically entails the conversion of RNA to DNA by reverse transcription, DNA-based amplification (i.e., isothermal amplification, loop-mediated isothermal amplification), and transcription back to RNA for detection by Cas13a or Cas13b, called \"SHERLOCK\" Gootenberg et al., 2017) . This was recently adapted for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (Joung et al., 2020) , and further developed as \"SHINE\" for testing unextracted samples (Arizti-Sanz et al., 2020) . The conversion of amplified DNA back into RNA can be avoided by using the DNA-sensing Cas12 for detection, a method called \"DETECTR\" (Chen et al., 2018) , which has recently been adapted for SARS-CoV-2 detection (Broughton et al., 2020) .

            "text": "Here, we report the development and demonstration of a rapid CRISPR-Cas13a-based assay for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This assay, unlike previous CRISPR diagnostics, does not require pre-amplification of the viral genome for detection. By directly detecting the viral RNA without additional manipulations, the test yields quantitative RNA measurements rather than simply a positive or negative result. To demonstrate the simplicity and portability of this assay, we measure fluorescence with a mobile phone camera in a compact device that includes low-cost laser illumination and collection optics. The high sensitivity of mobile phone cameras, together with their connectivity, GPS and data-processing capabilities, have made them attractive tools for point-of-care disease diagnosis in low-resource regions (Breslauer et al., 2009; D'Ambrosio et al., 2015; Kamgno et al., 2017; Wood et al., 2019) . By combining multiple crRNAs to increase Cas13a activation and analyzing the change in fluorescence over time rather than solely endpoint fluorescence, we are able to achieve SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection of ~100 copies/\u00b5L within 30 minutes. We also correctly identified all SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples tested (Ct values 14.37 to 22.13) within 5 minutes. This approach has the potential to enable a fast, accurate, portable, and low-cost option for point-of care SARS-CoV-2 screening.",

Initially, we designed 12 crRNAs along the nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2, corresponding to the three Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) N primer sets and the N primer set developed early in the pandemic in Wuhan, China (Zhu et al., 2020) .

The assay used purified LbuCas13a (East-Seletsky et al., 2017; East-Seletsky et al., 2016) and a quenched fluorescent RNA reporter (East-Seletsky et al., 2017; East-Seletsky et al., 2016) , together with in vitro transcribed (IVT) target RNA corresponding to the viral N gene (nucleotide positions 28274-29531). At a target RNA concentration of 480 fM (2.89 x 10 5 copies/\u00b5l), we identified 10 crRNAs with reactivity above the RNP alone control that contained the same RNP and probe but no target RNA ( Figure 1C ). The use of RNase-free buffers minimized background fluorescence, and the plate reader gain and filter bandwidth settings were optimized to capture low-level reporter cleavage. Similar results were obtained when full-length viral RNA was used as target RNA (Supplemental Figure 1A) . For the initial studies, we selected two crRNAs (crRNAs 2 and 4) that generated the greatest Cas13a activation as determined by the fluorescent reporter while maintaining low levels of targetindependent fluorescence (indicated by the RNP alone curve).",

LbuCas13a exhibited detectable reporter cleavage with as little as 10 fM (~6000 copies/\u00b5L) of target RNA (East-Seletsky et al., 2017) . Consistent with this, we found that RNPs made with either crRNA 2 and crRNA 4 did not appear to generate signals above the RNP controls for an IVT target RNA concentration of 1,000 copies/\u00b5L (Figure 1d ). The signal generated by direct detection with Cas13a appeared proportional to the concentration of target RNA in the assay. Given that the signal generated depends solely on the RNase activity of Cas13a, the linear rate of the reaction should approximate Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics. To determine if our assay was indeed quantitative, we compared the slopes determined by linear regression for different target RNA concentrations, using 1 to 10 \u00b5M KM and 600/s Kcat for the modeling (Slaymaker et al., 2019) ( Figure 1E ). The results confirmed that crRNA 2 and 4 each facilitated detection of at least 10,000 copies/\u00b5L of IVT N gene RNA. Since the measured slopes are proportional to the concentration of activated Cas13a, we could confirm that the rate of Cas13a activity scaled with concentration of target RNA (Supplementary Figure 2) . This ability to estimate target RNA concentration from the measured slope allows for direct quantification of viral load in unknown samples.",

To test this, we combined crRNAs 2 and 4 in the same reaction, keeping the total concentration of Cas13a RNPs constant but divided equally between RNPs made with each crRNA. We found that combining crRNA 2 and 4 markedly increased the slope of the detection reaction and the sensitivity of the reaction when measured with a fixed IVT .

Viral copy numbers were determined by standard RT-qPCR. The difference between the viral IVT and full genome limits of detection could be explained by different quantification techniques of the target RNA or by considerable secondary structure in the viral RNA (Manfredonia et al., 2020; Sanders et al., 2020) that reduces RNP on-rates, thereby lowering the affinity of the RNP for the target (Abudayyeh et al., 2016).",

For each dilution and assay time, the ability of the assay to detect the target RNA relative to the RNP control was quantified as percent accuracy, with eight positive tests out of eight replicates for 500 copies/\u00b5L for all assay times corresponding to 100% accuracy ( Figure 4D ). The results over all dilutions indicate that the limit of detection is approximately 200 copies/\u00b5L in under 30 minutes, with accuracy dropping to 50% at 50 copies/\u00b5L. Next, we analyzed the same patient samples as in Figure 3e to compare detection on the plate reader to that on the mobile phone-based device. We imaged each reaction for 60 minutes, along with the RNP control ( Figure 4E ), and the slope for a patient with Ct = 17.65 (Positive Swab 3) is significantly greater than the slope for a patient with Ct = 20.37 (Positive Swab 4) ( Figure   4F ), as expected. To assess the detection accuracy, we performed a linear fit using data from the first 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes of the run and compared the slope of each sample to the RNP control. We determined all five samples to be positive within the first 5 minutes of the assay, indicating that the device can provide a very fast turnaround time of results for patients with clinically relevant viral loads ( Figure 4G ). This result highlights the inherent tradeoff between sensitivity and time in the Cas13a direct detection assay. High viral loads can be detected very rapidly because their high signals can be quickly determined to be above the control, and low viral loads can be detected at longer times once their signal can be distinguished above the control. In this way, our assay demonstrates a time-dependent sensitivity (Supplementary Figure 5 ) that can potentially be tuned to address both screening applications and more sensitive diagnostic applications.",

By avoiding amplification and employing direct-detection, we show that the reaction rate directly correlates with viral copy number and may be used for quantification. When coupled with frequent testing, quantitative data are potentially beneficial: the course of a patient's infection can be monitored, and one can determine if the infection is increasing or decreasing. In symptomatic cases, viral loads follow the course of the infection (Wolfel et al., 2020) . Notably, samples with viral loads below 10 6 copies/mL or 1000 copies/\u00b5L did not yield viral isolates in one study in Germany (Wolfel et al., 2020) . Less is known about infectivity in asymptomatic cases, but SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic patients has been documented (Bai et al., 2020) , and asymptomatic patients may have viral RNA loads similar to those of symptomatic patients (Lee et al., 2020) .

The device avoids the need for a bulky laboratory-based plate reader, makes the assay portable, and opens up the possibility for future point-of-care or at-home use. The choice of a mobile phone as the basis for our detection device was motivated by the high sensitivity of current mobile phone cameras, the simplicity of integrating a mobile phone for detection, their robustness and cost-effectiveness, and the fact that they are widely available today, meaning that they do not compete with other devices for limited production resources in the midst of a pandemic. For similar reasons, previous diagnostic efforts utilized mobile phones to detect fluorescent signals generated by molecular diagnostic, such as loop- The direct-detection assay reported here, if scaled up, could fulfill the need for a test that provides rapid results and is available to be administered frequently (Larremore et al., 2020) .",

The national backlog in processing these laboratory-based tests clearly illustrates the need for rapid, point-of-care tests that can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. As the long-term immunity induced by natural infection or vaccination may decay in as little as 2-4 months (Ibarrondo et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020) , the need for rapid and frequent testing for SARS-CoV-2 will likely remain.

The codon-optimized Cas13a genomic sequences are N-terminally tagged with a His 6 -MBP-TEV cleavage site sequence, with expression driven by a T7 promoter. Purification of was based off of a previously published protocol with some modifications (East-Seletsky et al., 2017; East-Seletsky et al., 2016) . Briefly, expression vectors were transformed into Rosetta2 DE3 or BL21 E. coli cells grown in Terrific broth at 37\u00b0C, induced at mid-log phase (OD600 ~0.6) with 0.5 mM IPTG, and then transferred to 16\u00b0C for overnight expression. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, 0.5 mM PMSF, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche)), lysed by sonication, and clarified by centrifugation at 35,000xg. Soluble His6-MBP-TEV-Cas13a was isolated over metal ion affinity chromatography, and in order to cleave off the His6-MBP tag, the protein-containing eluate was incubated with TEV protease at 4\u00b0C overnight while dialyzing into ion exchange buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.0, 250 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP). Cleaved protein was loaded onto a HiTrap SP column (GE Healthcare) and eluted over a linear KCl (0.25-1.0M) gradient. Cas13a containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further purified via size-exclusion chromatography on a S200 column (GE Healthcare) in gel filtration buffer (20 mM HEPES-K pH 7.0, 200 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP) and were subsequently flash frozen for storage at -80\u00b0C.",

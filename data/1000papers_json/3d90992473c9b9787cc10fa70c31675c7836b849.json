            "text": "Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) is a single-stranded RNA virus from the genus Pestivirus in the family Flaviviridae with a 12.5 kb genome that encodes N pro ; capsid; the E rns , E1, and E2 glycoproteins; NS2-3; NS4A-B; and NS5A-B proteins (1, 2) . The BVDV is grouped into antigenically distinct genotypes 1 and 2, and cytopathic (CP) and non-cytopathic (NCP) biotypes based on the effect of virus on infected cell cultures (3) . Both genotypes are further divided into various sub-genotypes and in the United States BVDV-1b is the predominant sub-genotype (4) . The BVDV is one of the major players in causing Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex (BRDC) in cattle worldwide. The damage caused to the cattle industry by the disease every year is estimated to be worth more than a billion dollar due to high calf mortality, increased treatment costs and production losses (5) . In cattle, BVDV infection can be acute or persistent with a range of clinical symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, pneumonia, immunosuppression, congenital malformation, and abortion (5, 6) . Persistently infected (PI) cattle are chronic virus shedders and therefore, if not diagnosed and culled, they are the main source of BVDV within a herd (7) .",

Although majority of the commercial vaccines contain representative BVDV-1 and -2 strains, cross-protective efficacy of the MLV and KV vaccines against heterologous BVDV strains is still limited (7, 9) . The MLV vaccines can confer protection after a single vaccination by inducing neutralizing antibody along with CD4 + T cell and CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses (10) (11) (12) (13) . However, there are safety concerns associated with MLV such as immunosuppression, wild-type BVDV contamination of MLV vaccine and potential reversion to virulence (11, 14) . The KV vaccines on the other hand do not offer the same level of protective immunity as MLV vaccines without booster dose and require strong adjuvants which may lead to induction of bovine neonatal pancytopenia (15) (16) (17) (18) .",

Despite BVDV vaccination coverage of nearly 80% of the cattle population, prevalence of PI cattle over the years in North America has remained constant implying that the current vaccines are inefficient in eliminating and controlling BVDV infection (20) . Limited strain composition of available vaccines has not kept pace with new genetically and antigenically distinct subgenotypes arising and circulating in cattle herds (9, 19) . Thus, there is a need for a more coherent and contemporary proactive vaccine approach to eradicate BVDV since it is evident that the traditional vaccines have been inadequate in providing broad protection.",

Apart from neutralizing antibodies, CD4 + T cells are critical for enhancing the BVDV-specific antibody response and for clearance of infected cells, whereas CD8 + T cells can be directly cytotoxic for BVDV-infected cells (23) (24) (25) (26) . The BVDV E2 and NS2/3 are immunodominant antigens that drive majority of neutralizing antibody and T cell responses and hence, are frequently selected targets for BVDV subunit vaccine development (11, (27) (28) (29) . Experimental BVDV subunit vaccines involving recombinant E2 glycoprotein can provide some protection in cattle by limiting pyrexia, weight loss, leucopenia and viremia (21, (29) (30) (31) (32) . However, the protective immunity generated by the monovalent E2 subunit vaccines are mostly against homologous BVDV strains (21, (29) (30) (31) . In contrast, a multivalent E2 subunit vaccine can provide some level of cross-protection against BVDV-1 and -2 strains (33) . The focus of vaccine development efforts has been chiefly on inducing neutralizing antibody response by E2 glycoprotein (21, 30, 33) . Some of the latest reports have highlighted the importance of inclusion of NS2 and NS3 in vaccine for induction of protective BVDV-specific T cell responses (27) (28) (29) . MHC DR-restricted T cell epitopes identified from the highly conserved regions of E2 and NS3 are suitable for inclusion in a subunit vaccine (26, 34) . Given the heterogeneity of protective antigens among diverse BVDV isolate, mosaic antigens designed based on consensus protein sequences from circulating strains and addition of unique epitopes from disparate strains is likely to result in a chimeric antigen capable of eliciting broad protection (27, 35, 36) .",

The antigens expressed in replication-deficient adenoviruses elicited significantly higher BVDV-specific antibody and T cell responses compared to a commercial MLV vaccine (27) . However, since adenovirus vector is a BSL-2 agent with associated safety concerns, we developed recombinant protein-based prototype vaccines as a safer alternative for eliciting cross-protective immune responses in cattle. Two experimental vaccine formulations, one containing mammalian-expressed E2 123 , NS2-3 1 , and NS2-3 2 mosaic antigens; and another one containing E2 123 antigen expressed in insect cells were evaluated for their immunogenicity as well as protective efficacy. The immunized calves were challenged with a BVDV-1b (CA401186a) strain that is prevalent in United States and is considered to be a preferable BVDV-1 strain for vaccine efficacy challenge studies (37) . The CA401186a is a non-cytopathic BVDV-1b strain which persistently infects cattle leading to pyrexia and immunosuppression, but it doesn't cause severe gastrointestinal and respiratory disease (37, 38) . In vitro virus neutralization against representative BVDV-1 and -2 strains was used to evaluate potential for broad protection.",

Blood samples were lysed by freeze-thawing, centrifuged, and the lysate was used for BVDV isolation to determine viral titer by alkaline phosphatase monolayer immunostaining as previously described (6, 44, 45) . Briefly, serial 10-fold dilutions of sample lysate were prepared in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and 50 ml were added to 96-well plate containing fresh MDBK cells. Following incubation at 37\u00b0C for 72 h, the cells were fixed for staining with anti-BVDV E2 mAb (Cat. # 348, VMRD) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat #115-055-146). BVDV titers in blood samples were reported as the lowest dilution at which the lysate-exposed MDBK cells stained positive for BVDV E2. The profile of CBC in each blood sample was evaluated by HESKA Veterinary Hematology System (RTI LLC, Brookings, SD 57006, USA) with counting parameters set for bovine WBC, HGB, RBC, and PLT. The counts for platelets, WBC, and RBC and WBC morphology were verified microscopically.",

After priming, antigen-specific IFN-g responses were detected in calves immunized with the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail (E2 123 , NS2-3 1 , and NS2-3 2 ) and in the calves immunized with the baculovirus-expressed E2 123 antigen ( Figure 2A) . Notably, the Bac-E2 123 -immunized calves had a significantly higher (p < 0.05) post-prime E2 123 -specific IFN-g response compared to the calves immunized with the 293Fexpressed antigen cocktail and the calves immunized with the Vira Shield TM 6 commercial vaccine (Figure 2A) . Strong IFN-g response against NS2-3 1 was only detected in the calves immunized with the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail and the response was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the response detected in the calves immunized with the Vira Shield TM 6 vaccine ( Figure 2A) . The calves immunized with the 293Fexpressed antigen cocktail also had a high mean NS2-3 2specific IFN-g response, but this response was not significantly different from the other treatment groups (Figure 2A) . Following priming, no E2 123 -and NS2-3 1 -specific IFN-g responses were detected in the calves immunized with the Vira Shield TM 6 vaccine and only 1/5 calf in this group had IFN-g response against NS2-3 2 (Figure 2A) . Boosting expanded antigen-specific IFN-g responses in the calves immunized with the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail and the calves immunized with the Bac-E2 123 antigen ( Figure 2B ). The calves in both treatment groups had high levels of E2 123 -specific IFN-g responses, but only the mean response of the calves immunized with the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the response detected in the Vira Shield TM 6 and the sham control groups ( Figure 2B) . The calves immunized with the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail also had the strongest NS2-3 1 -and NS2-3 2 -specific IFN-g responses ( Figure 2B ). Significantly higher NS2-3 1 -specific IFN-g response was detected in the calves immunized with the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail compared to the responses detected in the calves immunized with the Vira Shield TM 6 vaccine (p < 0.05) and the sham treatment (p < 0.01) ( Figure 2B) . Boosting with the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail significantly expanded NS2-3 2 -specific response compared to the Vira Shield TM 6 vaccine (p < 0.01) and the sham treatment (p < 0.001) ( Figure 2B) . Overall, post-boost antigen-specific responses were significantly low in the calves immunized with the Vira Shield TM 6 vaccine where only 2/5, 3/5, and 2/5 calves responded to E2 123 , NS2-3 1 , and NS2-3 2 , respectively ( Figure 2B ). IFN-g responses were also analyzed using a peptide pool containing previously defined BVDV CD4 + T cell epitopes (34) (Figure 2 ). Calves immunized with the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail and the Bac-E2 123 exhibited high levels of post-prime CD4 + T cell epitope-specific IFN-g responses (Figure 2A) . The Bac-E2 123 antigen elicited significantly higher epitope-specific responses compared to Vira Shield TM 6 vaccine (p < 0.05) and sham treatment (p < 0.01) (Figure 2A) . The epitope-specific IFN-g responses were evidently amplified post-boost in the calves immunized with either the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail or the Bac-E2 123 antigen ( Figure 2B) . However, the calves immunized with the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail had significantly higher (p < 0.05) response than the other treatment and control groups ( Figure 2B) . Interestingly, post-boost IFN-g responses against the defined BVDV CD4 + T cell epitopes induced by Vira-Shield \u2122 6 were considerably lower, with only 2/5 calves responding, than the responses induced by the prototype vaccines ( Figure 2B ).",

Three novel mosaic BVDV polypeptides designated E2 123 , NS2-3 1 , and NS2-3 2 , which consist of immunogenic antigens highly conserved among BVDV-1 and -2 strains were generated and evaluated for their potential to induce cross-protection against diverse BVDV strains. This approach has previously been pursued to generate cross-protective vaccine candidates for pathogens with heterogeneous circulating strains or subtypes (27, 35, 36) . In a previous proof-of-concept study, the mosaic polypeptides induced BVDV-specific antibody and T cell responses and conferred protection against a BVDV-2 strain following immunization with adenovirus expression constructs (27) . In the current study, the genes encoding the three mosaic polypeptides were used to express recombinant proteins in Human Embryonic Kidney Expi293F cells (E2 123 , NS2-3 1 , and NS2-3 2 ) or High Five \u2122 insect cells (E2 123 ) and authenticity of the affinity purified antigens was confirmed using polyclonal serum generated against BVDV-1 and -2 strains (Figure 1 ) (27) . Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of two prototype vaccines formulated using a cocktail of the 293F-expressed antigens or the Bac-E2 123 antigen was evaluated by primeboost immunization of calves followed by challenge with a BVDV-1b strain, the predominant sub-genotype in United States (4). Both prototype vaccines, but not the Vira Shield TM 6 commercial vaccine, primed strong IFN-g responses against the immunizing antigens and the induced memory was recalled by peptides generated using well characterized DRB-restricted BVDV CD4 + T cell epitope sequences (Figure 2A ) (26, 34) . This suggests that priming with a single dose of the prototype vaccines could generate memory responses that can be recalled upon BVDV infection. This outcome was further supported by the observation that, the IFN-g memory induced by the 293Fexpressed antigen cocktail underwent strong recall after boosting ( Figure 2B) . Moreover, these outcomes were consistent with the previous findings where the same mosaic antigens expressed by recombinant adenoviruses elicited IFN-g responses of similar magnitude that were strongly recalled by BVDV CD4 + T cell epitopes in the immunized calves but not in the commercial MLV vaccinees (27) . Experimental BVDV subunit vaccines induce strong IFN-g responses against the immunizing antigens (21, 29, 31) however, there is very limited evidence as to whether these responses are recalled against BVDV (27, 33) . The antigen-specific IFN-g responses elicited by the prototype vaccines were strongly and consistently recalled by all the representative BVDV-1b (CA0401186a and TGAC) and BVDV-2a (A125 and 1373) strains ( Figure 3) . The BVDV-1b and -2a strain-specific IFN-g recall responses detected in the calves immunized with the prototype vaccines were also significantly (p<0.05) higher than the recall responses detected in the Vira Shield TM 6 vaccinees ( Figure 3B) . The pro-inflammatory anti-viral response of IFN-g is crucial for limiting BVDV infection in cattle (46, 47) . Therefore, the potential of 293F-expressed antigen cocktail and the Bac-E2 123 antigen to elicit strong BVDV-specific IFN-g memory responses is of great significance as it could result in improved vaccine efficacy.",

            "text": "Cattle infected with BVDV develop neutralizing antibodies against the virus (48, 49) . The prototype vaccines generated high levels of BVDV antigen-specific IgG responses in the immunized calves ( Figure 4) . The elicited IgG responses, especially by the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail, contributed towards BVDV-1a, -1b, and -2a neutralization as demonstrated by the detected VN titers against diverse strains ( Figures 5, 6) . Importantly, the calves immunized with the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail developed exceptionally high VN titers (in the range of 1:1024 to >1:8192) against the representative BVDV-1 strains ( Figure  5 ). Neutralizing antibody titers of this magnitude are usually achieved with MLV vaccination or multiple BVDV exposures (9, 43) . Additionally, these titers were higher than the BVDV-1 neutralizing antibody titers that were generated in calves immunized with recombinant adenoviruses expressing the mosaic antigens (27) . In contrast, the Bac-E2 123 antigen and Vira Shield TM 6 vaccine induced moderate to very low BVDV-1 neutralizing antibody titers in calves ( Figure 5) . The 293Fexpressed antigen cocktail induced BVDV-2a neutralizing antibodies in a few calves and the overall titers were inferior compared to the BVDV-1 neutralizing antibody titers ( Figure 6 ). This outcome was similar to a previous finding in which, following boosting with recombinant adenoviruses expressing the mosaic antigens, low BVDV-2a neutralizing antibody titers were detected in 3/5 immunized calves but all 5/5 calves were completely protected upon challenge with a BVDV-2a strain (27) . The Vira Shield TM 6 vaccine elicited either no or very low BVDV-2a neutralizing antibody titers, whereas the Bac-E2 123 antigen failed to elicit BVDV-2a neutralizing antibodies in calves ( Figure 6 ). It is worth noting that altogether, the prototype vaccines induced higher neutralizing antibody titers against BVDV-1 strains than BVDV-2 strains. Recombinant adenoviruses expressing the mosaic antigens had also induced better BVDV-1 neutralizing antibody titers than BVDV-2 neutralizing antibody titers (27) . Since the three components of the E2 123 mosaic antigen were generated using E2 from BVDV-1a, -1b, and -2, epitope coverage was biased towards BVDV-1 genotype, and thus it can be deduced that the skewed neutralizing antibody response towards BVDV-1 strains is likely due to the presence of higher number of BVDV-1 neutralizing epitopes than the BVDV-2 neutralizing epitopes in the mosaic antigens. The data from in vitro virus neutralization demonstrate that the prototype vaccine containing the 293Fexpressed antigen cocktail is better than the Vira Shield TM 6 vaccine in eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies and therefore, has the potential to bridge the gap between the protective immunity conferred by the MLV and KV vaccines (9, 15, 38) .",

Most importantly, following challenge, the calves immunized with the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail were protected from immunosuppression ( Figure 8B ). In comparison, the calves immunized with the Bac-E2 123 antigen had mild leukopenia, whereas the calves immunized with the Vira Shield TM 6 vaccine had significant decrease in WBC counts from day 3 until around day 8 post-challenge ( Figure 8B ). This outcome indicates that the 293F-expressd antigen cocktail can elicit better immune responses for improved BRD management in cattle.",

However, the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail and the Bac-E2 123 antigen conferred strikingly different levels of protection in cattle. Non-structural antigen NS3 when used as an immunogen by itself confers protection in cattle by significantly reducing viremia (28, 51) since it induces T cell responses important for controlling the BVDV infection (25, 29, 34) . Moreover, NS3 in Flavivirus is a highly conserved nonstructural antigen critical for inducing protective T cell responses and this could explain why the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail, which contained the NS2-3 antigen, was more efficacious at reducing the viral burden as well as preventing immunosuppression in vaccinees compared to the Bac-E2 123 antigen (52) (53) (54) .",

The 293Fexpressed antigen cocktail induced antibody responses that were better at in vitro BVDV cross-neutralization. Compared to the 293F-expressed antigen cocktail, the Bac-E2 123 antigen, despite inducing high E2-specific IgG responses, elicited lower BVDV-1 neutralizing antibody titers with no BVDV-2 neutralization. The n-glycosylation pattern in Pestivirus E2 glycoprotein is relevant to the protein structure and function, and hence, to the infectivity of virus (55) (56) (57) . Similar to our findings, BVDV E2 antigen produced in insect cells have been previously demonstrated to elicit BVDV neutralizing antibodies however, it doesn't confer complete protection in cattle (30, 33, 58, 59) . Therefore, it could be concluded that the inherently simpler post-translational modifications offered by the insect cells influence the antigenicity of candidate vaccine in a manner that potentially leads to misrepresentation of some, if not all, key conformational neutralizing epitopes (30, 60, 61) . Mammalian expression system, on the other hand, generates more authentic post-translationally modified antigen and thereby is more suitable for the production of an efficacious subunit vaccine (21, 30, 32, 61) .",

Therefore, a targeted approach of designing a computationally optimized vaccine for broader coverage can be developed and deployed to improve management of BVDV in cattle. Furthermore, this study highlights and reinforces the impact of the non-structural antigens on vaccine efficacy. The Flavivirus non-structural antigens, which are relatively more conserved compared to E2, are known to be rich in broadly protective T cell epitopes that have been exploited in order to improve vaccine efficacy (54, (62) (63) (64) . Therefore, in future the BVDV non-structural antigens apart from NS2-3, need to be investigated to identify other protective determinants for inclusion in a contemporary subunit vaccine. The outcomes from this pilot study also provide insight into the gaps in current vaccines' efficacy that warrants future BVDV vaccine upgrades.",

In a pandemic, emotion is even more perilous.

Today's best medical practices use evidence-based medicine (EBM) which is defined as the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of best available evidence to make medical decisions. It consists of reviewing and assessing all the available information to determine what the best treatment could be [1]. Jeniceck and Hitchcock also asserted that ''good evidence is not everything.

Patients and caregivers should not be exposed to additional risks, so also the safety of medical personnel should be ensured. It is the duty of the treating oncologist to educate the patients regarding prevention, control and treatment of infection depending on their condition. The strategy for promoting ''Stay at Home'' if asymptomatic should be reinforced for routine follow-up [6] . Use of personnel protection remedies and social isolation, unless visiting the hospital is absolutely essential should be reinforced to all people and specifically for cancer patients to reduce the probability of getting infection [7] . A detailed travel history, contact history, respiratory symptoms and/or fever history is compulsory for all patients and the accompanying persons. COVID-19 can infect a person, and they can be contagious prior to the onset of symptoms or even without developing symptoms. Therefore, aggressive testing or screening of asymptomatic patients' needs to be done [8] . There are two types of COVID-19 tests: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests and the serum antibodies tests [9] . COVID-19 testing with combined immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies test is effective for the rapid diagnosis, immunoglobulin M positive indicates an acute infection and immunoglobulin G antibodies indicate a later stage of infection [10] . It has been shown that some patients with a negative COVID-reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test displayed abnormalities on lung computed tomography (CT) scan [11] , questioning the sensitivity of the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test. It has been reported that the combination of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and lung CT-scan lead to the highest diagnostic sensitivity (92%) compared to RT-PCR alone (78%), lung CT-scan alone (67%) or combination of 2 RT-PCR (86%) [12] . Combination of both RT-PCR test and lung CT-scan to exclude COVID-19 patients is thus recommended to limit the risk of admitting an infected patient for surgery. This is also important to the fact that cancer patients with active COVID-19 infection undergoing surgery have a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality.

There is no difference in the creation of surgical smoke between laparoscopy and laparotomy procedures. The differences in the aerosol composition are related to the source of energy (0.07-0.42 lm for electrocautery, 0.1-0.8 lm for laser ablation and 0.35-6.5 lm for ultrasonic scalpels) or target organ (with highest originating from the liver and the lowest from the skin, brain matter and subcutaneous fat [22, 23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 329, "end": 333, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 745, "end": 749, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 750, "end": 753, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Surgical Smoke and Surgery (Laparoscopy and/ or Laparotomy)"}, {"text": "Until the current crisis, the phenomenon of the transmission of bacterial and viral particles in infected patients from the plume was disregarded and/or neglected by surgeons due to the relative rarity of infected patients and the low infectivity rate of surgical staff dealing with these patients.

However, there have been no documented cases of viral transmission from surgical smoke in previous pandemic experiences. Can the association between surgical smoke and virus transmission from earlier case reports be extrapolated to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted to surgical personnel from surgical smoke? The conditions from previous studies and case reports differ from our current situation in terms of the type of virus, route of transmission, the contagiousness of the virus, ability to withstand a given energy device and the period of exposure.

Hybrid operation theatre (OT) equipped with the unidirectional downward airflow ventilation system keeps ultrafine particle concentration values of surgical smoke lower than the OTs adopting the upward displacing airflow ventilation system [27] . In open surgery, smoke evacuation systems are used to control surgical plume, typically composed of suction devices attached to the electrosurgical source. Smoke evacuator/suction device should be placed at a maximum distance of 5 cm away from the smoke origin, otherwise 50% of the smoke will still be present in the operating room [28] . The efficacy is variable and depends on factors including evacuator flow rate, angulation of the surgical device from the skin, distance between the evacuator nozzle and the surgical site, and direction and speed of external airflow in relation to nozzle flow [29] . When this form of particle spread occurs, all operating room (OR) surfaces including personnel garments are contaminated, and potential transmission of viable particles is thereby increased. Whereas laparoscopic procedures have the ability to create a more regulated closed environment that allows all inflow and outflow of air to be controlled through the well-defined points of access, the trocars. The next most common form of smoke elimination seen in the operating room is the smoke evacuator with filter. The particulate removal capability of smoke evacuator devices is, by design, limited to the efficiency and size of their filters. There are a number of types of filters available. Charcoal filters use activated charcoal; they can absorb both gas and vapour and can eliminate strong-smelling gases. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters act to filter suspended compounds. They can retain particles larger than 0.3 lm at an efficiency rate of 99.97%. Ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) filters retain 99.9% of particles at 0.1 lm and are a depth filter, filtering matter by different methods depending on the particle size. Currently, the most effective smoke evacuation system is the triple-filter system, which includes a prefilter that captures large particles, a ULPA filter, and a special charcoal that captures the toxic chemicals found in smoke [30] . The Association of perioperative Registered Nurses guidelines states that perioperative personnel should use ULPA filters routinely for surgical smoke.

These filters should be connected via standard tubing to the trocar evacuation port which can be used to evacuate the produced smoke and filter the possible viral load [36] . If a reliable filtering and evacuation system for gases is used, laparoscopy is preferable to open surgery, where smoke contamination is intense and less spillage of blood. The integrated flow systems should be configured in a continuous smoke evacuation and filtration mode, preferably through a ULPA filter [11, 36] .

As mentioned in the hierarchy of control, elimination of hazard is more important for workplace safety. With regards to smoke, containment is the best way of elimination which is best done with minimal invasive surgery techniques. At present, there is no evidence of viral transmission through laparoscopic or open approaches, but the absence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence. And we all know very well that prevention and protection are always better than cure. We recommend modifications of minimal access techniques like a double valved trocar, low-pressure pneumoperitoneum, low energy device setting, smoke filtration and evacuation system, surgery performed by a senior surgeon with a limited team and use of personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of aerosolized particle exposure to healthcare personnel. It is imperative to follow the best surgical practices and start treating our patients, as delaying would result in adverse outcomes. Our method of filtration of smoke and evacuation is economical, easy to assemble, practical and especially useful to provide safety to the healthcare workers at the same time not burdening the patient and hospital. Minimal invasive surgery is extremely safe when adequate precautions are taken.

In 2003, a study on the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China showed that the loss of contact with medical care providers led to an increase in the withdrawal of antiseizure medications resulting in an increase in seizure frequency [1] . The current COVID-19 pandemic is an important challenge for the management of patients with epilepsy worldwide. Remote patient management systems [2] (in use since the 1990s and now integral to several national digital health strategies [3] [4] [5] [6] ) are a valuable tool during a pandemic to continue medical follow-up. They include different types of communications such as phone calls, one-way video links, and on live interactive communication. In addition, the epilepsy medical community is involved in educational activity and promoting knowledge dissemination through courses and scientific congresses. These activities also rely on face-to-face interactions and are also likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The survey was comprised of 60 questions divided into four sections: demographic and general information followed by remote work for clinical practice, education, and scientific meetings and symposia (for details, see supplementary data). Items assessed practice before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first two sections were mandatory (demographics and clinical practice). We used different types of questions: closed (n = 60), semiopen (n = 12) , and open (n = 12). Some questions used semiquantitative scales such as the Likert scale.",

Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare the frequency of the institutional and personal remote system use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and the frequency of use of these two systems during the same period. Open-ended questions on free text allowed us to obtain qualitative data to illustrate respondents' feelings about their satisfaction with remote systems. We constructed a coding frame to analyze free-text data about satisfaction of remote clinic, online teaching, and virtual meeting. We subdivided into level categories to evaluate positive and negative aspects with some subcategory: cost, time, interaction, and target public.

There was no statistical difference between the frequency of use of institutional versus personal remote system (p = 0.2).

However, contrary to the pre-pandemic period, the use of institutional remote systems was significantly higher than that of personal systems (p = 0.001). Only one respondent from China did not have to reschedule any face-to-face clinics compared with 138 who rescheduled most or all their clinics (80.3%). One hundred and sixty-two respondents (94.2%) replaced faceto-face visits by various ways of remote connections with the families or the patients. This involved all clinics for 32 (19.8%), most of them for 98 (60.5%) and only a few for 32/162 respondents (19.8%). Sixty-eight (42%) used phone calls without any remote specific connection with or without video, and 135 a remote system with video connection (83.3%). This system was institutional for 101 (74.8%) either regularly available (50/101, 49.5%) or developed for this pandemic (51, 50.5%). A personal remote system was used by 34 (25.2%). The duration of remote clinics was considered as identical as face-to-face ones for 50 respondents (31.1%), shorter for 77 (47.8%, including much shorter for 13), and longer for 34 (21.1%, including much longer for 6). Regarding antiseizure medication changes, 50.9% of respondents tended to make fewer amendments (n = 83), 45.4% same (n = 74), and 3.7% more (n = 6). Electroencephalogram (EEG) were less frequently requested for 65.6% (n = 107), without changing the frequency requested for 30.1% (n = 49), and more frequently requested for 4.3% (n = 7). Blood test were less frequently requested for 52.8% (n = 86), without changing the frequency requested for 42.3% (n = 69), and more frequently requested for 4.9% (n = 8).",

Since 2015, however, some studies have found no clear correlation [20, 21] . For example, 4th year medical school students have more absences than 2nd year students due to conferences, meetings, and residency interviews, but unlike personal absences, this type of absence is not significantly associated with lower academic test scores [22] . This is likely due to the improvement of means of communication that have enabled the students to fill in the gaps. In a recent study using a combined approach between online teaching and face-to-face interactive medical course, online teaching attendance was higher than face-to-face, and the exam score was correlated to online teaching attendance. Ninety-eight percent were satisfied with this teaching, and 93% wished to extend it to the entire second cycle [23] . This is a good illustration of the change of perspective that is taking place in undergraduate and postgraduate university education. Factors associated with a good adherence to online teaching are mainly the quality of the technical system, support system, learner and instructor, and the perceived usefulness [24, 25] . The advantages and disadvantages identified by the providers in our study were in line with the literature, i.e., on the one hand, a greater flexibility, an increase of the dissemination of knowledge, a decrease of travel cost and time, and better accessibility, on the other hand, less peer-to-peer exchange and feedback difficulties, including nonverbal communication [26] .",

With more than 40,000 participants, they claimed this to be \"the biggest neurology meeting ever\" [27] . A virtual congress allows for lower prices, time savings, and a greater dissemination of knowledge both to and from all over the world.

Indeed, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, some studies and reviews identified remote clinics in the field of epilepsy as an opportunity in rural regions and in resource-poor setting where the access to a specialist is an important barrier to epilepsy diagnosis and treatment [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . However, the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to have accelerated the shift towards the implementation of remote clinics and had enabled France and Italy to fill the gap with a strong development of remote patient management tools.",

Responses were from many countries around the world thanks to the involvement of international societies. We cannot rule out the presence of a selection bias since this questionnaire was sent online. However, we believe that this study can present a picture about practitioners' opinion on remote work in epilepsy and help to develop future perspectives. In addition, a significant proportion of respondents in our sample focus on pediatric care. The use of remote clinics in this population is probably easier than in adults. Indeed, parents may be able to successfully complete a visit on their child's behalf but adults with cognitive impairment or other limitations may have more difficulty negotiating the technical requirements of such a visit. Finally, we did not request a detailed description of the applied methods of online teaching. The survey aimed to have answers on the three activity fields of the respondents without adding much details relatively long survey.",

The advances of these methods of communication have allowed a rapid adaptation to confinement policies using their flexibility and their accessibility. This allowed a maintained link between practitioners and patients, professors and students, and between groups and colleagues. The satisfaction was acceptable, and almost all responders agreed on a possible future for remote work, for some of the scientific and educational meetings or for occasional teleconsultations. In addition, the positive ecological impact of such approaches might be interesting in addition to the economic impact on health and academic costs. It is likely that in \"the world after COVID\", the shift process to the implementation of these new modes of communication is moving forward, although the balance between face-to-face and remote work has yet to be determined in our different fields of activities, and the long-term benefit of such shift to virtual interaction should be evaluated.",

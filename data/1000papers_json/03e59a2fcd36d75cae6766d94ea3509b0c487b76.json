COVID-19 outbreak began in China in December 2019 and spread rapidly worldwide, with the World Health Organization declaring it a pandemic on March 11, 2020 . At present, 4,000,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been detected in more than 200 countries, resulting in more than 280,000 deaths (3) , and additional patients with COVID-19 are expected to be cured and discharged over time. Prevention remains the focus for control of COVID-19 (4), but the cured or recovered patients should not be ignored. Currently, little is known about cured COVID-19 patients, and there are no studies to clarify the infectious of the cured or guidelines regarding the management of these patients. However, it is very important to understand the clinical characteristics of cured patients, especially with respect to re-infection and person-toperson transmission.",

However, in patients with COVID-19, the relevance of IgM and IgG antibodies has not been clarified. Researches demonstrated that IgM and IgG could be identified during the middle and later stage of COVID-19, and thus could have a high diagnostic value in patients with acute infection (6) (7) (8) . Compared with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the detection of antibodies by ELISA is faster, less expensive, and easier to perform. Therefore, antibody detection might be widely used to assist in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Till date, no study has evaluated the clinical significance of IgM and IgG detection in terms of re-infection and person-to-person transmission, especially in COVID-19 patients who were cured and discharged home.",

Although they were PCR or IgM positive, these patients displayed no clinical manifestations of infection, and no signs of new acute infection were found on chest CT, indicating that these patients did not meet the re-infection criteria. Based on these findings, a positive result on PCR or IgM assay should not be considered indicative of COVID-19 re-infection. There might be several reasons for absence of re-infections. Firstly, the patients with COVID-19 were discharged from hospitals after following strict criteria, and the duration of hospital stay was more than 14 days, far exceeding that in community acquired pneumonia (10) , which means that the SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to be have been eradicated. Secondly, 17.6% of the patients were negative for antibody, which might prevent a repeat infection by the virus. Thirdly, an effective prevention and control strategy ensured that the cured patients were kept away from other confirmed COVID-19 patients. Finally, the medical staffs working in the front line have not been infected till date, which effectively prevented secondary infections and spread of the disease in the hospital (11) . Re-infection cases were reported in Hong Kong and the United States (12, 13) . Based on the known literatures and our research, we believe that patient immunity is helpful to avoid infection, but not all patients can produce immunity after infection. Therefore, the prevention and control strategy is still the key point (14) . The antibodies can be observed in the middle and later stage of COVID-19, and performed well in the diagnosis of COVID-19 (7, 8, 15) .

Our study found that was resurgence of positive results of PCR or IgM tests in some patients after being discharged home. Among people who were in contact with the cured patients, no one was diagnosed with COVID-19 as reported by the Guangzhou CDC. The incubation period of COVID-19 is 3-14 days, and our follow-up period for cured patients was more than 14 days. This might have helped in excluding the cases in the incubation period Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org of the infection. Based on these findings, we believe that the cured patients cannot cause person-to-person transmission.

Further logistic regression analysis showed that the treatment of antibiotic and length of stay were risk factors for antibody production. The mechanism of antibody production associated with antibiotic treatment and long-term hospitalization is not clear. Although diabetes, cancer, and other diseases may cause a decline in immunity, they do not affect the production of antibodies. Similarly, although the use of glucocorticoids may inhibit the immune system, it also has no effect on the production of antibodies.",

However, the value of IgG and IgM in the diagnosis of cured COVID-19 patients is not clear. In our study, we found that both IgM and IgG have no relationship with PCR. Therefore, for the cured patients, IgG and IgM neither have a diagnostic value, nor can they be used to replace the PCR test. Since neither re-infection nor person-to-person transmission was found in the cured patients, IgG and IgM cannot be used to guide the prevention and control of COVID-19. This study has the following limitations. Firstly, since this was an observational study, no interventions such as re-exposure of the cured patients to SARS-CoV-2 were performed. Therefore, it is hard to judge whether the cured patients were immune to the virus. Secondly, at the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak, there is no effective antibodies test, and the testing of antibodies were not performed at that time. So we could not compare the levels of antibody between hospitalization and follow-up. Thirdly, this was a single center study carried out in Guangzhou, a mild epidemic area. Accordingly, the conclusions of this study might not be suitable for extrapolation to other areas. Fourthly, our conclusions were based on a small sample size, which need to be further verified in a study with a large sample size. Nevertheless, our study results clarified some clinical features of the cured patients and maybe be of considerable importance for the prevention and control of COVID-19.",

In-depth interviews with 14 core policy elites from four health areas were conducted. As governance is a multidimensional concept, interviewees were asked to evaluate different dimensions based on the World Bank's five elements (Coherent decision-making structures, Consistency and Stability, Stakeholder participation, Supervision and Regulation, and Transparency and Information). Overall, the new payment system was perceived as poorly governed. Since its introduction, it has not offered a new governance perspective because it used a conventional top-down approach, while political windows for cooperation were not wide open. Of the five governance dimensions, the scores were lowest in Stakeholder participation. There was a large perception gap between physicians and government officers here. Participants from academia perceived Consistency and Stability as ineffectively governed. In the meantime, the government has mainly created health policy in Korea. As a result, stakeholder participation, especially the participation of medical personnel, has been insufficient in the process of health policy formulation. The study suggests that the decision-making process in health policy needs to be more participatory and reliable, with governance regarded as a high priority.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Many countries have been reforming their reimbursement system to improve the effectiveness of healthcare services. To successfully reform the payment system, research on the key factors behind successful reform has been carried out [1] , finding that governance and stakeholder engagement were the core contributors [2, 3] . However, healthcare reform is hard to perfect since each stakeholder has different interests, power levels, and perceptions [4] . In particular, payment system reform is challenging when reforming fee-for-service (FFS) payment to Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) payment because changing payment methods directly influences the revenue of hospitals. For this reason, establishing governance is important, including collaboration with health care providers, consistency in government policies, and public trust in those policies. While the reimbursement system for hospitals in most countries is based on DRGs, in Korea it is based on fee-for-service. Since the fee-for-service payment mechanism has incentives to increase medical services, it has been pointed out as the main reason for the rise in the cost of national healthcare expenditure, and there has been discussion that the payment system for hospitals should be based on According to the five dimensions of the World Bank's measure, coherent decision-making structures enable those responsible for making decisions to be endowed with the discretion, authority, tools, and resources necessary to fulfill their responsibilities. Stakeholder participation is another core dimension of governance that can influence policy and performance from agenda-setting to the evaluation process. It is rooted in the premise that stakeholder views are integral to meaningful governance and should be incorporated into the decision-making process. Transparency and information ensure that information is available to those who can make decisions. Supervision and regulation are other dimensions of governance that can hold governments accountable for implementing a new payment system. Consistency and stability help avoid uncertainty around rule-making and enforcement, especially during periods of political change. If regulations are consistent, people can make long-term decisions with the assurance that the rules will not change [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 232, "end": 235, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 316, "end": 319, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 320, "end": 322, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 449, "end": 452, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2306, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "This study focused on the collaborative governance of stakeholders in the decision making and implementation process using the World Bank's governance concept.

In this context, the governance of this study included the behavior of organizations affected by health policy. For payment system reforms, these factors include its relationship to the government (such as senior officials from the Department of Health or National Health Insurance entities), health care providers (association of medical providers, CEOs or clinicians from the hospitals), and the renowned professors in the health policy field.

Under the FFS payment system, the insurer focuses on demand-side intervention such as user fees in the form of cost-sharing as a means to reduce healthcare expenditure owing to the excessive utilization of health services. The Korean healthcare system has maintained a high level of copayment. About 41.6% of total expenditure on health comes from private sources in Korea in 2011, making its share of public expenditure far below the average of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. In 2011, 78.4% of private healthcare expenditure was sourced from out-of-pocket expenses [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 797, "end": 801, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "History of the DRG-Based Hospital Payment System in South Korea"}, {"text": "To control the increasing out-of-pocket payment expenditure resulting from the FFS payment system, the government of Korea decided to adopt a DRG payment system like a prospective payment system (PPS) of the US Medicare. Although Korea began to introduce the DRG payment in 1997, it was only applied to a limited number of providers as a pilot initiative due to strong opposition from healthcare providers [34] . Despite continued opposition, however, the DRG payment system was officially adopted for seven DRGs, which included simple procedures and surgeries, in 2002. However, healthcare providers were still given the option to decide whether or not to participate in the DRG payment system. The compulsory adoption of the seven DRGs payment system was only confirmed in 2013, involving all healthcare providers from clinics to general hospitals. At the same time, another DRG payment system, called \"the New DRG payment\", similar to the Diagnosis Procedure Combination payment scheme of Japan, was introduced by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) to one public hospital in 2009, initially covering 20 DRGs. The number of DRGs and hospitals using this payment method increased every year. The New DRG payment system was applied in 42 public hospitals in Korea, covering 550 DRGs in 2013. As of 2020, 98 hospitals, including private-owned hospitals, are covered by the New DRG payment system on a voluntary participation basis. The New DRG payment system is criticized for having few incentives to reduce medical costs in that it includes considerable elements of fee-for-service payment and allows for the NHIS non-covered items. On the other hand, the opposition from the hospitals exists at the same time because there is a more comprehensive payment system than the previous fee-for-service payment mechanism.

Policy elites can be defined as people who lead the policy-making process and have considerable influence on decision-making. Korea's health insurance policy is generally led by the government, but in principle, it is formulated through cooperation and discussion from medical providers and experts. In this context, the policy elites included public officers, medical providers, and scholars to explore their perspectives on the New DRG payment system. Two pilot interviews were conducted before the actual survey to contextualize and modify questionnaires, covering topics about the governance of the New DRG payment system.

The evaluation tool consisted of 12 questions. For five dimensions, we conducted a seven-point Likert scale to show governance structures by visualization and regarded more than four points as a positive evaluation. First, we identified the Coherent decision-making structures dimension, which included three questions on whether (i) all the institutions in charge of the supervision of payments can fulfill their responsibilities, (ii) they have routines for risk assessments and management strategies in place, and (iii) the cost of regulating and administering them is reasonable and appropriate. Second, we evaluated the Stakeholder participation dimension with a single question on whether each stakeholder has effective representation in the governing bodies in terms of introducing, implementing, and assessing the new payment system. Third, we explored the Transparency and Information dimension by using four questions on whether (i) the objectives of the new payment are formally and clearly defined; (ii) the main components of the new payment system rely upon an explicit and appropriately designed institutional and legal framework; (iii) clear information, disclosure, and transparency rules are in place; and (iv) the new system has minimum requirements to protect patients such as the protection of privacy or personal information. Fourth, the main feature of the Consistency and Stability dimension is the quality of the system. To identify the stability of the system, we asked whether the purpose and motivation of the new payment system remained substantially the same during past political change. Lastly, we evaluated the Supervision and Regulation dimension by using three questions on whether (i) the rules on compliance, enforcement, and sanctions for the new payment supervision are clearly defined; (ii) the financial management rules for hospitals are clearly defined and enforced; and (iii) the new payment system has structures for ongoing supervision and monitoring in place.

In terms of collaborative governance, the lack of participation by experts in making policy and implementation process is a flaw in Korea. In other words, the huge challenge in payment reform in Korea appears to be not only inexact modeling and affordability but also stakeholder participation and political consistency. It is important that the government shares the policy goal and its values with other stakeholders and that efforts to involve them in the decision-making process are essential.

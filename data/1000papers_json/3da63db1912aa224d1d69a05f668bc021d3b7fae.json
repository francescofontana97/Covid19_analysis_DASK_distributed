            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical condition with high mortality. HMGB1 (high-mobility group protein B1) is one of the key proinflammatory factors in the ARDS \"inflammatory storm.\" According to previous studies, some microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in this process. We aimed to determine the contributing miRNAs targeting the expression and release of HMGB1. miRNA expression in the peripheral blood of patients with ARDS was measured by miRNA microarray. miRNAs targeting HMGB1 were screened and explored for further study. In LPSinduced cell and mouse ARDS models, we explored the effect of this miRNA on the expression and secretion of HMGB1 by Western blot, real-time qPCR, and ELISA. The effects of this miRNA on the NF-kB signaling pathway, proinflammatory cytokines, and NLRP3 (nod-like receptor protein 3) inflammasome were detected by Western blot and real-time qPCR. In ARDS models, microRNA-574-5p (miR-574-5p) expression could be induced by the TLR4/NF-kB pathway upon LPS stimulation. It could suppress the inflammatory response by targeting HMGB1. Enforcing the expression of miR-574-5p or HMGB1 siRNA silencing inhibits the activation of NF-kB signaling pathway and the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, overexpression of HMGB1 reversed the antiinflammatory effect of miR-574-5p. In ARDS mice, overexpression of miR-574-5p suppresses alveolar leukocytes infiltration, interstitial edema, protein effusion, and inflammation. This study demonstrated that miR-574-5p provided negative feedback to LPS-induced inflammation and relieved ARDS. It may provide new therapeutic strategies for ARDS.",

NF-kB is an important transcription factor that regulates the expression of a variety of miRNAs (25, 26) . To identify whether the TLR4-mediated increase in miR-574-5p is A Total protein cytoplasm nuclear dependent on the activation of NF-kB pathways, we pretreated HPMECs with 100 mM SC-514, an NF-kB inhibitor (27), for 1 hour followed by LPS stimulation. We measured miR-574-5p expression and showed that inhibition of NF-kB reduced the induction of miR-574-5p in HPMECs ( Figure 1E ). Importantly, we observed that LPS-induced miR-574-5p expression was impaired in PDTC (ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a potent NF-kB signaling inhibitor [28] )-pretreated mice ( Figure 1F ). It is essential to clarify how NF-kB is associated with the increase in miR-574-5p in response to LPS stimulation. In humans, the miR-574 gene is believed to be located in the first intron of the gene encoding Noxp20 on human chromosome 4 (29) . To address this issue, we first used JASPAR (http:// jaspar.genereg.net/) to predict potential binding sites between NF-kB p65 and the promoter of Noxp20, and the results showed that there was at least one NF-kB binding site ( Figure 1G) . Importantly, the binding site was validated via chromatin IP analysis. As presented in Figure 1H , binding activity of NF-kB p65 was detected in the promoter region of miR-574-5p, and this interaction was enhanced by LPS stimulation.",

Overexpression of miR-574-5p inhibited the activity of a luciferase reporter construct containing the HMGB1 39 UTR. In contrast, the activity of luciferase constructs containing the site mutant 1 39 UTR of HMGB1 was not inhibited, whereas the activity of luciferase constructs containing the site mutant 2-4 39 UTR of HMGB1 was still inhibited by overexpressing miR-574-5p ( Figure 5B ).

To clarify whether miR-574-5p affected the stability of HMGB1 mRNA, 24 hours after the transfection of HPMECs with miR-574-5p mimics or negative control mimics, we used actinomycin D to inhibit mRNA transcription. We collected cell samples at different time points and detected HMGB1 mRNA abundance by real-time qPCR. As shown in Figure 5D , miR-574-5p mimics indeed decreased HMGB1 mRNA stability in HPMECs. The HMGB1 protein concentrations decreased significantly in miR-574-5p-overexpressing HPMECs ( Figure 5E ), and miR-574-5p inhibitor showed the opposite trend ( Figure 5F ). In addition, we explored at the role of miR-574-5p in RAW 264.7. It showed that miR-574-5p also reduced the expression of HMGB1 in RAW 264.7 ( Figure E1 ). Similarly, miR-574-5p mimics decreased the HMGB1 concentrations in the supernatant of HPMECs ( Figure 5G ). To test whether miR-574-5p suppresses endogenous HMGB1 expression in vivo, we next injected mice with miRNA agomir negative control or miR-574-5p agomir via intravenous injection. As shown in Figures 5H-5J , the enforced expression of miR-574-5p significantly decreased the amount of HMGB1 protein in lung tissue, serum, and BAL fluid.

Then, inhibitor NC+LPS 6h inhibitor 574-5p+ si NC+LPS 6h inhibitor 574-5p+ si HMGB1+LPS 6h miR-302b can negatively regulate bacteriainduced inflammation by targeting IRAK4.

There were 45 miRNAs identified in the microRNA array that were differentially expressed in patients with pneumonia-related ARDS compared with healthy subjects, yet we restricted the focus of this work to miR-574-5p because we consider HMGB1 to play a key role in ARDS. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other miRNAs also contribute to the beneficial effects in ARDS, and additional studies should be performed in the future.",

            "text": "In summary, we have determined that miR-574-5p regulates the expression of HMGB1, a key proinflammatory factor of ARDS that is involved in the excessive inflammatory responses both in vitro and in vivo. These studies support an idea that miR-574-5p may serve as an important negative regulator of inflammatory responses by controlling critical aspects of respiratory system homeostasis. Thus, these findings provide insight into the role of miR-574-5p in ARDS and may indicate a novel therapeutic approach to relieve ARDS. n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org. HPMECs were cotransfected with miR-574-5p inhibitor/miR-NC inhibitor and si-HMGB1/si-NC. After 48 hours, the cells were treated with LPS for 6 hours. The HMGB1, NLRP3, and cleaved caspase-1 protein concentrations were evaluated by Western blotting (n = 3). (E) mRNA concentrations of IL-6, IL-1b, and TNF-a were measured by real-time qPCR in HPMECs treated as described in C (n = 5). (F) mRNA concentrations of IL-6, IL-1b, and TNF-a were measured by real-time qPCR in HPMECs treated as described in D. The values presented are the mean 6 SD. Comparisons were made by t test in A. Comparisons were made by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett Multiple Comparison in E and F. *P , 0.05, **P , 0.01, ***P , 0.001, and ****P , 0.0001.",

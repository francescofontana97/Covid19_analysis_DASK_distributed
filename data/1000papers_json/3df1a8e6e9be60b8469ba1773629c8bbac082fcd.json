Poverty is a major driver of these poor health outcomes in the United States. Innovative anti-poverty policies may help reduce economic malaise thereby increasing the health and longevity of the most vulnerable Americans. However, there is no consensus framework for studying the health impacts of anti-poverty social policies. In this paper, we describe a case study in which leading global experts systematically: (1) developed a conceptual model that outlines the potential pathways through which a social policy influences health, (2) fits outcome measures to this conceptual model, and (3) estimates an optimal time frame for collection of the selected outcome measures. This systematic process, called the Delphi method, has the potential to produce estimates more quickly and with less bias than might be achieved through expert panel discussions alone. Our case study is a multi-component randomized-controlled trial (RCT) of a workforce policy called MyGoals for Healthy Aging.",

The 20th century saw social policy and health policy begin to converge in Europe and Latin America [4, 5] , with the World Health Organization formally recognizing the social determinants of health as \"the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age\" [3] . The Affordable Care Act in the United States led to billions of dollars spent on the social determinants of health in the hope of preventing disease before it occurs [6, 7] .",

            "text": "This uncertainty arises from three challenges. First, the process of biological \"wear and tear\" associated with living in poverty begins from the time of conception [18, 19] , but most anti-poverty programs are targeted toward older children and adults [13] . As a result, it is necessary to devise a sensitive measure of health-a \"yardstick\"-that will change within the time frame of the study. A second challenge is that there is a latency between the time that one is exposed to a social policy and the point at which measurable changes in health occur [20] . While income support programs can immediately lift a family out of poverty, it takes time for that family to invest the money in healthy food, housing, and health care. Even after these investments are made, the effects of these investments take time to manifest as measurable changes in health [14] . A third challenge lies in the nature of the available objective biomarkers of chronic disease [21] . These can be difficult to collect, are sometimes statistically noisy, and may have an inadequate empirical base linking the measure to tangible health outcomes in humans. They also must be conceptually aligned with the expected mechanisms through which a given social policy influences health. What is needed is a sensitive but broad biological measure that can serve as a yardstick of changes in health over a relatively short period of time.",

How should we operationalize what the intervention does vis-\u00e0-vis changes in human physiology, and how do we know how far in the future we need to measure these changes given the nature of the intervention? This question is underscored by a recent meta-analysis of 38 experimental social policy RCTs, which found that most lacked adequate statistical power to detect a change in the outcome of interest [13] . Had a sensitive measure been available, the statistical power would have been higher.",

Biomarkers can include blood assays, such as cholesterol levels, or medical examination data, such as blood pressure. Biomarkers are appealing endpoints for social policy RCTs because they are objective, they have established links to disease, and they change over a relatively short period [22, 23] .

Our team was awarded funding to refine the structure, and we decided to deploy the Delphi method to address these reviewer concerns. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 10 This increases income thereby reducing psychological stress [13] . Reductions in psychological stress influence physical and mental health via allostatic load [22] while also producing synergies with the executive function training program to reduce neural damage and improve executive function, thereby improving work performance and behavioral risk factors [30, 31] . Here, executive function (e.g., the ability to plan and execute those plans) was separated from broader cognitive function to show how employment can enhance broader cognitive skillsets, such as math [31] .",

These factors led the experts to believe that having a \"friendly face\" with whom to talk about life's challenges would potentially have an impact on measures of stress, anxiety, and depression. It was therefore postulated that the coaching had both the effect of addressing some of the executive function deficits of some participants and also serving to provide social support for others.",

Concerns included: 1) difficulty obtaining hair from bald people or women who are concerned about cosmetic changes [35] , and 2) concerns that cortisol levels will be suppressed in some people with chronic stress but elevated in others, leading to results that are difficult to interpret. At that point, Participant 5 agreed that hair collection would be an issue. This reviewer also suggested that a waist-to-hip ratio be obtained as a measure of obesity, noting recent evidence that body-mass index was an incomplete measure of obesity [36, 37] . This participant also suggested a long-term measure of life trauma in order to better understand whether trauma altered participants' responses to the intervention [38] . The final model appears in Figure 3 . sequencing, including all of the measured outcomes, and to consider enhancements to broader cognitive function as a part of the outcome, rather than part of the intervention (Figure 2 ).

In addition, after learning about the experiences that the executive function coaches have had with the clients, the expert panel felt that part of the intervention entailed adding a \"friendly face,\" or a friend to talk with about the participants' problems. (1) Measured using the Three-Item Loneliness Scale; (2) measured using the Insomnia Severity Index; (3) measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory; (4) measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9; (5) measured using the Perceived Stress Scale; (6) Blood Pressure, C-Reactive Protein, Interleukin-6, Hemoglobin A1c; (7) measured by trained examiner three times; (8) measured using the Eating at America's Table Survey; (9) measured using questions taken from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; (10) measured height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio; (11) measured using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Flanker + Dimensional Card Sort tasks from NIH Toolbox; (12) measured using the National Death Index. Note: Serum will be banked for possible future biomarker analyses such as conserved transcriptional response to adversity, gene X environment studies, biological clock studies, and metabolomic studies as these are rapidly evolving fields of study that will undoubtedly change over the period of performance of the grant.",

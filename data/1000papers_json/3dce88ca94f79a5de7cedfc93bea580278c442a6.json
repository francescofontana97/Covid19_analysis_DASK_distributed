A common narrative in developed nations is that urbanized and technology-driven lifestyles have diminished healthy human relationships with natural environments leading to a range of health issues and reduced wellbeing [2] . While long-acknowledged as practices across cultures, outdoor nature-based therapeutic interventions have grown significantly in number and type in recent years [3] . Outcomes research has supported outdoor therapeutic approaches as improving the lives and wellbeing of those experiencing mental health issues [4, 5] as well as for general health promotion [6] . While an evidence base is present supporting exposure to nature and green spaces as 'pathways' toward comprehensive health benefits [7] , a lack of comprehensive theoretical and conceptual articulation exists specifically for nature's contribution or role in psychotherapy and mental health outcomes, leaving outdoor therapies without an explicit theory of change for their application as a clinical practice.",

Significant variety exists in practice, from walk and talk therapy [9] , to expedition-based wilderness therapy [10, 11] , to garden and animal-assisted therapies [12] . These approaches have shown improvement across a wide range of social, emotional, physical, physiological, and psychological outcomes and populations [13] [14] [15] . While numerous approaches exist, all purporting contact with nature as a common essential component, theoretical development articulating mechanisms of change and processes contributing to the therapeutic outcomes are lacking [8, 16, 17] . We postulate this knowledge gap exists due to the diversity of therapeutic approaches and subsequent study designs [18, 19] .",

Search terms were proposed by the first author using PsycINFO thesaurus to identify possible key word for studies investigating outdoor therapies. Search terms were then agreed upon by all authors through exploratory searches, appraisals of other review findings, reduction of terms through testing (e.g., to increase specificity of findings without losing ideal reviews), and open dialog prior to running the database search. Further, consistent search criteria details included that studies had to be published in English and were peer-reviewed. No publication date restrictions were applied and the final comprehensive search was conducted 15 August 2020. Table 1 displays search terms and results by database. ",

Covidence facilitates review studies with multiple researchers, manages criteria and inclusion/exclusion choices throughout review stages, maintains confidentiality between researchers when reviewing studies, and provides researchers with an audit trail of decisions and outcomes [25] . Specific eligibility criteria were established utilizing a PICOS modified statement (see Table 2 ). Further detailed questions were developed and agreed upon for screening, allowing all three researchers to 'vote' on inclusion/exclusion of papers with common language and understandings. Two rounds of screening (i.e., title/abstract & full text) occurred with two researchers completing independent and confidential reviews concurrently in each round. Conflicts were resolved by the third researcher and then discussed openly to ensure consensus for the decision was achieved. The first screening was completed (by NJH & LEG) at the level of title and abstract only and resulted in an exclusion of 81 studies for not meeting the PICOS criteria. At this point in the study, two umbrella reviews in specific outdoor therapies were located in a sperate search; one in animal-assisted interventions [5] and one in equine-assisted interventions [12] . After careful consideration, we chose to remove systematic and metaanalytic reviews of animal-assisted and equine-assisted studies to avoid repeating this recently completed scholarly work, and in recognition that therapeutic relationships in animal-assisted therapies are triangulated with client, therapist and another interactive species (i.e., dog, horse, etc.) while the remaining approaches utilize the environment (i.e., nature) as the setting for therapy-the focal point of our study. A second round of review was completed (by NJH & CRF) at the level of full text and saw another 67 studies excluded for not meeting PICOS inclusion criteria (i.e., wrong intervention such as a health promotion focus without a therapeutic component, or wrong study design such as a scoping review). The PRISMA flow chart [26] (Figure 1 ) below displays the selection process resulting in the final 14 studies to be included in the present review.",

The studies were organized into five categories based on their self-identified approaches: nature-based therapies [27, [29] [30] [31] 36] , forest therapy [34, 35, 38] , horticultural therapy [33, 37, 39] , wilderness therapy [28, 32] , and adventure therapy [18] . Nature-based therapy is defined as \"an intervention with the aim to treat, hasten recovery, and/or rehabilitate patients with a disease or ill health, with the fundamental principle that the therapy involves plants, natural materials, and/or outdoor environment[s]\" [27] (p. 372). Forest therapy (or forest bathing or shinrin-yoku) is defined as a healing practice in which \"people immerse themselves in nature, while mindfully paying attention to their senses\" [34] (p. 1). Horticultural therapy is defined as \"the engagement of a person in garden-related activities, facilitated by a trained therapist, to achieve a specific treatment goal\" (p. 931, American Horticultural Therapy Association, cited in [33] ). Wilderness therapy is defined as a form of residential treatment, primarily for adolescents, and may include expedition trekking or base camp models with a focus on immersion in wilderness locations [28] . Adventure therapy is defined as programs or services that \"utilise outdoor activities and experiential learning exercises to help participants to deal with their psychological problems\" [18] (p. 28).",

It is worth reminding readers that a quality rating for an umbrella review is not a quality assessment of the individual studies within each review, but rather how well the systematic reviews and meta-analyses were conducted and reported.

ART posits that time spent in compatible natural environments creates the experience of soft fascination (attention that becomes involuntary) and thereby allows for a renewed energy and ability to pay attention-hence, reflecting the theory's name [41] . SRT suggests that our positive physiological responses to safe natural environments is evolutionary and reduces levels of stress. Being away is another construct of ART and Kamioka et al. [33] identified that being free from the stress of work and experiencing joy was the main reason found in their systematic review of horticultural therapy. Wen et al. [38] described the characteristics and seasonality of the forest interacting with the five senses as the central features of forest therapy in reaching improved mental health outcomes. There is also a reference to Gilbert's model of affect regulation suggesting evolutionary emotional responses (e.g., soothing) to being in nature [43] .",

[31] found explanations of nature increasing the experiences of memory and thereby extending the longevity of benefits gained. Britton et al. [29] pointed to the characteristics and diversity of natural environments and how humans interact with them. They provide the example of water-based programs where movement and balance are engaged (i.e., vestibular and proprioception systems) and submersion in water which can reduce pain, alter body sensations and provide an equitable experience for someone with physical limitations. Further, they found connections between physical challenges of the wilderness therapy programs on the physical body (i.e., aches and pain) and reports of increased self-efficacy and resilience. Again, these findings do not clearly identify mechanisms of change. Lee et al. [35] shared the common activity of walking in forest therapy as well as the 'five senses' approach which appears to be sometimes manualized, but also practiced with great diversity, such as \"forest viewing, forest meditation, Qi-Qong, aromatherapy, herbal tea therapy, and craftwork using natural materials\" (p. 11). The authors also posited that just being present in nature, or just viewing nature, may not be enough-suggesting that more needs to be known about the dosage, protocols, practitioner influence, and whether or not outcome measures utilized are actually capturing what they intend to.",

The breadth of interventions were diverse and all were comprised of being placebased/outdoors, with active engagement of bodies-in-environments, and often focused on increasing one's connection to nature.

Still, we were unable to identify clear articulations of nature's contribution to the specific therapy undertaken. ART and SRT were both presented in an explanatory manner but fall short of explaining outcomes. Descriptive models of change in these therapies is sorely lacking and in need of development, along with clear descriptions of practice for future researchers to design and plan research by. Echoing these needs, Britton et al. [29] stated \"a consistent lack of description of setting characteristics or the natural environment as a 'subject' was evident across all of the studies\" and further highlighted the \"need to improve our understanding of complex nature-based interventions for health outcomes\" (pp. 64-65).",

The practices are often inscribed in real-life contexts where it is not feasible or desirable to randomize participant allocation, and the aforementioned complexity may compromise the overall transferability and generalizability across the field of outdoor therapies. Moving forward, Mygind and colleagues [36] propose practitioners and researchers alike ought to channel a substantial effort into formulating program theories. Such a theory should identify: (1) Intervention input; activities; outputs; intermediate outcomes; and long-term outcomes; and (2) a theory of change, i.e., description of how and why the desired change is expected, pertaining to the specific type of nature experience and intended health outcome. In such theories of change, not only should the type and characteristics of nature be considered, according to Mygind et al. [36] , but also the way the natural environments are activated, including the social and pedagogical processes that it affords more specifically. Such a theory can also guide research into which types of nature, and which qualities of those types of nature, are relatively effective for particular targeted outcomes. In addition to the descriptions of the intervention and the outdoor environment, future studies should also provide clearly defined and specific details with regards to: (3) the individual participants, e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, sociodemographic status, and needs/diagnoses, (4) the group, if applicable, and (5) qualifications and roles of instructors/guides/therapists.",

When applied, procedures of randomization and blinding must be described. Kotera et al. [34] , in their review on forest bathing, found that some RCTs used a cross over design with minimal interval, which violates the accuracy of the results. In circumstances where randomization is not practical or possible, Mygind and colleagues [36] propose that regression discontinuity and comparison time series designs may be feasible alternatives for achieving unbiased estimates of intervention effects. Other types of quasi-experimental designs include dynamic wait-listed designs, in addition to so-called stepped wedge and regression point displacement designs [36] . A potential weakness in the use of RCTs in the context of outdoor therapies is that they tend to focus on outcomes and therefore fail to account for how social and environmental processes influence treatment trajectories [29] .",

At present, most studies are based on qualitative or quantitative analysis of evidence-based medical research, lacking basic theoretical insights of forestry.

We hope that the progression of research in these specific areas of practice will contribute towards further defining theory and mechanisms of change. Two recent studies have utilized a realist methodology to attempt to capture the complexity and make theoretical progress within the field of outdoor therapies. Fernee et al.

[46] explored greenspace interventions for mental health in clinical and non-clinical populations. Masterton and colleagues put forth detailed program theories, as requested by Mygind et al. [36] above, which can serve as hypotheses to be tested and refined in future studies.",

Outdoor therapies take place in complex social and environmental contexts with almost infinite mediating and moderating variables [49] . A rigorous and determined program of research is required in order to respond to the request for explicit and in-depth theories of change. However, whilst developing and refining theoretical frameworks for each specific discipline within outdoor therapies practice, we may collectively, as a field, join forces to arrive at an overall ontology of interconnectedness [50] as a metatheory for outdoor healthcare rather than striving to identify singular explanations tying therapeutic process and nature together in causal explanations. Instead, accept that our presence IN nature is that of an embodied experience AS nature-where both human and more than human are simply parts of a whole. As an analogy, should we be seeking the causal link between oxygen and psychotherapy? While obvious biological and physiological arguments can be made for the benefits of effective breathing and clean air, maybe the reasons are too evident and unnecessary to formulate via research for therapeutic outcomes? In a coherent system approach, humans play an equal part in human flourishing and in the relationality between humans and nature, and further remind us of the false dichotomy of separation between the two [51] . In this regard, a holistic theory of integrated relatedness may be developed as a parallel expression of support for outdoor therapies while the explanatory science catches up. ",

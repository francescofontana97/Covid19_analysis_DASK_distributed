This study aimed to provide 21 details on how medical students had been affected by the pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, 22 717 medical students participated in the web-based survey. The questions included how their 23 mental status had changed before and after the Japanese nationwide state of emergency (SOE). 24 65.9% (473/717) participated in the study. 29.8% (141/473) reported concerns about the shift 25 toward online education, mostly because they thought online education could have been 26 ineffective compared with in-person learning. Participants' subjective mental health status 27 significantly worsened after the SOE was lifted (p <.001). Those who had concerns about a shift 28 toward online education had higher odds of having generalized anxiety and being depressed (OR 29 1.97, 95% CI 1.19 -3.28), as did those who requested food aid and mental health care resources 30 (OR 1.99, OR 3.56, respectively). Given our findings, 31 the sudden shift to online education might have overwhelmed medical students. Thus, we 32 recommend educators to inform learners that online learning is non-inferior to in-person learning, 33 which could attenuate potential depression and anxiety. 34",

In Japan, 17,668 cases have been 40 confirmed as of June 18, 2020, with an explosion in the number of cases in early April(2). While 41 Japan seems to be bringing the outbreak under control through active cluster tracing, restriction 42 of mass gatherings, and advocating universal masking and hand hygiene, there were no simple 43 solutions to this issue(3). After the surge in COVID-19 cases, on April 16, 2020, the Government 44 of Japan (GoJ) declared a state of emergency (SOE) in all 47 prefectures, which lasted until May 45 25, 2020(4). In Okayama, a prefecture in the western part of mainland Japan(5) with 46 approximately 1.9 million people (ranked 20/47 among the 47 prefectures), only 25 confirmed 47 cases had been reported by the end of May 2020.

Until the 55 stay-home request was lifted on May 22, medical students were required to cope with this sudden 56 change in their lifestyle, and shifted to online education amid the fear and considerable 57 uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. In the early 2000s, the severe acute respiratory syndrome 58 coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak had a devastating impact on academic education, including 59 sudden curriculum changes and rapid integration of information technology(6-8). Similarly, the 60 current COVID-19 pandemic has provoked significant turmoil in society. In particular, mental 61 health problems due to the pandemic have drawn attention worldwide as studies have suggested 62 the need for mental health care interventions during the outbreak(9-14). Medical students, who 63 essentially need clinical exposure, may have been impacted even further by the pandemic. 64 65 In Japan, medical schools have different admission practices and curricula than in the United 66",

Furthermore, a considerable 213 number of medical students had concerns around their basic life security, demanding support 214 from the university in the form of financial aid, food aid, technical support, and mental health 215 care resources due to the SOE.

Third, we asked participants to provide their mental health status and time spent on 262 self-learning related activities before the SOE (approximately six weeks before the survey 263 implementation), both of which are subject to recall bias. Also, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were 264 obtained only after the SOE. Thus, it is possible that they might have not changed during the 265 period.

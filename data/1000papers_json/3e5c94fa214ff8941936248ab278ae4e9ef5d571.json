The WHO 2 also reports that all healthcare workers, including healthcare professionals, are exposed to occupational hazards. The International Labour Organization (ILO) 3 reported that millions of healthcare workers suffer from work-related diseases and accidents, and many succumb to occupational hazards. Scholars and practitioners in the field of healthcare and occupational health and safety (OHS) are striving to raise awareness of the risk factors and importance of workplace health and safety among this population. 1, 3, 4 Schulte et al. 5 defined an occupational hazard as the shortterm and long-term dangers or risks associated with unhealthy workplace environments. Tullar et al. 6 and Joseph and Joseph 7 stated that the healthcare workers at greatest risk are doctors, healthcare professionals, nurses, laboratory technicians, and medical waste handlers.",

A critical appraisal of all studies was performed to assess their quality in terms of validity and reliability, as based on performance bias, information bias, selection bias, and detection bias.

Our ultimate objective was to compare (without any form of bias) groups that were exposed to occupational hazards and those that were not exposed in terms of risk factors and outcomes. 16 For the sake of validity and reliability, all of the studies selected for inclusion were prospective in nature and included data pertaining to exposure and outcomes, while controlling confounding factors. We also looked for studies with high internal reliability (consistency across items within a test) and high external reliability (consistency in agreeability between uses/rates). 12 In our final analysis, we considered whether the research had been conducted in an appropriate manner (internal validity). 13 We also considered the generalizability of the results, that is, whether the results were pertinent to other situations (external validity).",

Health care workers and administrators must work together to eliminate or minimize these hazards through the introduction of and strict adherence to engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment (PPE) controls. The The main routes of exposure to chemical hazards include ingestion, injection, skin contact or absorption, and inhalation. 34, 35 Contamination and exposure are both affected by the duration and frequency of exposure, the quantity of drugs undergoing preparation, and the use of PPE. 23 The adverse health effects can be attributed to compounds deemed carcinogenic (cancer causing), mutagenic (promoting mutations), teratogenic (causing birth defects), or toxic to various organs. 36 Alcohol hand sanitizers commonly used by healthcare professionals are flammable and harmful to the skin. There have also been reports on the dangers of detergents used to clean surfaces, which can lead to irritation and promote allergies of the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. 35, 37 There is also evidence that some detergents can react with other products commonly stocked in healthcare facilities to produce toxic vapors. 31, 35, 38 It has been found that low concentration disinfectants, such as quaternary ammonium salts, alcohols, hydrogen peroxide, iodophors, and phenolic and chlorine compounds, can have toxic effects and irritate the skin, eyes, and respiratory system. 23 The inhalation of powdered medications and vapors exposes healthcare professionals to the risk of poisoning and allergic reactions. 39, 40 Engineering control strategies: isolating and segregating hospital or healthcare facility areas and equipment; providing exhaust hoods to provide local ventilation when compounding and mixing drugs; providing biological safety cabinets to safeguard chemicals; and providing containers to prevent needle stick injuries. Flammable chemicals should be stored away from sources of ignition and dangerous chemicals substituted with less harmful ones. 36 Cuts, burns, hearing loss, motion sickness, and muscle cramps. 47 Engineering controls: minimize the use of sharp tools, use machine guarding, use quality sockets, and close water faucets when not in use. 48 Administrative controls: promote and practice safe work procedures, such as when using electrical equipment (e.g. cords). 18 Educating workers about the cleaning equipment and cleaning up broken glass is also recommended. 49 PPE: use of appropriate footwear, gloves, eye and nose protection, and protective clothing 18 3. Tripping, slipping, cuts, and falling Poor housekeeping, poor layout, and slippery tiled floors. 50 Open power cables, live wires, broken glassware, lancets, knives, scissors, and scalpels. 47 Bruised skin, cuts, broken bones, and muscular injuries. 50 Engineering control: proper lighting, the construction of safe stairwells, and regular building maintenance (e.g. floors and workspaces). 44 PPE: use of appropriate footwear, gloves, eye and nose protection, and protective clothing 18 4. Exposure to microwave radiation, and ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. 50 Risks imposed by radiation from X-ray machines and other diagnostic imaging systems, and the radionuclides used in nuclear medicine and radiation therapy. Workers face risks from nonionizing radiation, lasers, ultraviolet rays, and magnetic resonance imaging. 51 The risk increases when using heat sealers and poorly maintained or insulated radio-diagnostic equipment. 48 Tissue damage, risk of cancer, and abnormal cell mutation (e.g. abnormal leukocytes). 48,51 Engineering control: reducing the time of exposure, increasing the distance to X-ray machines, and increasing the amount of shielding. 20 PPE: use of appropriate footwear, gloves, eye and nose protection, and protective clothing 18 perceptions of workers can greatly affect their implementation of risk-mitigation strategies. 20",

            "text": "This systematic review confirmed a positive correlation between OHS hazards (biological, physical, chemical, and psychosocial), and work-related injuries, occupational health problems, and work-related diseases. The burden of disease and attributable fraction of work-related diseases and occupational injuries has been shown to cause considerable social and economic losses for employees, families, companies, countries, and societies at large. 8 Generally, the burden of disease is assessed using disease/disability adjusted life years. The burden of disease is measured as the impact of morbidity and premature mortality within a given area. 2, 69 Scholars and professionals agree that reducing, substituting, or eliminating OHS hazards in healthcare facilities is important for healthcare workers, helps to ensure patient safety, and enhances the overall quality of healthcare. 7 Many researchers have used the \"hierarchy of controls,\" which is based on the assumption that interventions are most effective when implemented at the source and least effective when applied at the worker level. 20 Gorman et al. listed control interventions from most to least effective as follows: elimination, substitution, engineering, administrative, and PPE. Researchers have also emphasized the importance of eliminating hazards or substituting hazardous materials with less hazardous materials. 20, 70 Taimela et al. 71 argued that administrative controls, such as training and ensuring adequate staffing, are crucial to eliminating or minimizing occupational hazards. Engineering controls, such as redesigning work spaces, ensuring adequate ventilation, and introducing automated systems for repetitive tasks, were emphasized by Liberati et al. 72 PPE, such as the use of gloves, clothing, and eye wear, are considered the least effective and have the most profound consequences in the event of failure by exposing the individual directly to the hazard. 20 Nonetheless, many researchers and professionals agree that all such controls should be applied collectively, in order to minimize the effects of hazards. 20,70-72 Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) due to repetitive actions, less than optimal computer equipment, and a poorly engineered workspace in which healthcare professionals are forced to overreach and/or sit while maintaining an awkward posture. 43 Healthcare professionals are tasked with lifting and transferring equipment, tools, and instruments. One's physical fitness level and demographic background were shown to affect the risk of developing MSDs. 52 Workplace and job-related demands, poor administrative and team support, and a negative attitude toward job tasks were all strongly correlated with MSDs. 47 Ergonomic hazards can lead to chronic pain in the arms, back, or neck. Frequently, they lead to MSDs, such as carpel tunnel syndrome, which tends to reduce work performance and productivity and can have a serious detrimental effect on one's health-related quality of life. 50 Strained movement due to localized pain, stiffness, sleep disturbances, twitching muscles, burning sensations, and feelings of overworked muscles. 47 Engineering control strategies: redesign workstations with appropriate chairs and computer equipment. 43 Workstations should be configurable to a wide range of medical personnel with different body shapes and sizes. It is also recommended that lifting and handling equipment, such as trolleys, be installed in areas requiring heavy lifting. Automation should be adopted when resources and practicability allow. 46 59 Healthcare professionals also face violence during robberies and the theft of addictive prescription pain killers, such as Oxycontin and Vicodin. 54 We also identified organizational culture and structure, interpersonal relationships at work, job content and satisfaction, homework balance, and the changing nature of work as important psychosocial hazard risk factors among healthcare professionals. 54, 57, 60 Work-related stressors have a detrimental impact on worker's health and safety, in terms of mental, musculoskeletal, chronic degenerative disorders, metabolic syndrome diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. 61 Psychological hazards at work were associated with heart disease, depression, physical health problems, and psychological strain. 54 Low back pain was the most common work-related ailment among healthcare workers in Taiwan. 53 Employees who experience job insecurity and/or workplace injustice were more likely to suffer from burnout. 54 Job demands and the level of control experienced by the worker were significantly associated with fatigue; exposure to workplace violence affects psychological stress, sleep quality, and subjective health status among healthcare professionals. 59 Engineering control strategies: creation of isolation areas for agitated patients and designing an office layout that prevents the healthcare professionals from coming into direct contact with customers/patients or being trapped. 57 Spaces should be well lit and separated to ensure that client-care provider contact is controlled and access is allowed only when absolutely necessary. Proper working communication devices and video surveillance, as well as panic buttons and alarm systems. 62 Administrative control: management policies make unequivocal declarations of non-violence/anti-abuse. 63 Management can encourage workers to participate in the design of forwardrotating (day-evening-night) shifts and work schedules that impose gradual shift changes and ease the adaptation to nonregular work shifts to ensure that all concerned get adequate sleep. 61 Educate healthcare professionals about the risks associated with shift work. 20 Well-trained security personnel should be hired to deal with unruly customers. 59 Training in conflict management and problem-solving could also help workers to prevent or de-escalate violence. 60, 64 Nametags should be used by employees, and reporting and response procedures should be enhanced.",

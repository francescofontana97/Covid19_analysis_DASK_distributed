Antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 29 the serum of patients infected in early 2020 remained active against most mutated Spike 30 pseudotypes. The majority of serum samples were equally able to neutralize the B.1.1.7 Spike 31 pseudotype, however potency was reduced in a small number of samples (3 of 36) by 5-10-32 fold. This work highlights that changes in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike can alter neutralization 33 sensitivity and underlines the need for effective real-time monitoring of emerging mutations 34 and their impact on vaccine efficacy.",

However, effective protection from 38 viral infection can also require sufficient breadth of serum neutralization rather than potency 39 alone. This is because of the high-levels of variation observed in major antigens across some domain (RBD -found within the S1 subunit of Spike). There is considerable amino acid 65 variation between the two RBDs, despite their conserved binding to ACE2, which explains why 66 the majority of SARS-CoV-induced neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were found not 67 to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, although some cross-binding activity has been observed (Wu et al., 68 2020) and targeted mutations can enable neutralization . Similarly, the 3 majority of COVID-19 sera have either weaker or no neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV, but 70 cross-neutralizing mAbs have been isolated (Brouwer et al., 2020 for a particular mAb but not for other mAbs from within the same binding cluster. This 300 highlights that different antibodies use distinct molecular contacts within shared epitopes, such 301 that a single mutation may not be detrimental to all antibodies within the same binding cluster.",

In this study we evaluate neutralization of 26 a series of mutated Spike pseudotypes including a B.1.1.7 Spike pseudotype.

The classic example in which a 41 lack of breadth limits the protective capacity of the antibody response is Influenza. Here, the 42 majority of neutralizing serum antibodies target only a particular set of influenza strains as a 43 result of antigenic drift of the immunodominant hemagglutinin head (Zost, Wu, Hensley, & 44 Wilson, 2019). Due to this, an annual vaccine is required and must be matched to the most 45 probable circulating strain in any given year to ensure protection from infection. Emerging data 46 from human vaccine trials and challenge studies in animal models suggest that neutralizing 47 antibodies can prevent disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes 48 COVID-19 (McMahan et al., 2020; Polack et al., 2020). However, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 49 have begun to emerge in both human and farmed animal populations (S. Kemp et al., 2020; 50 Oude Munnink et al., 2020; Tegally et al., 2020; Welkers, Han, Reusken, & Eggink, 2020). These 51 variants include mutations in the major neutralizing antigen, the Spike glycoprotein, and raises 52 the question of whether neutralizing serum responses induced by early circulating strains or by 53 vaccines based on the Spike sequence of these early strains can neutralize the recently the emergence of multiple mutations in Spike in the human population, we 56 reasoned that a logical way to identify potential escape mutations was to look at sites of amino 57 acid variation relative to the most closely related human betacoronavirus SARS-CoV, which 58 caused the original SARS outbreak in 2003 (CDC, 2003). These two closely related viruses are 59 characterized by a notable difference in transmission dynamics and disease outcomes (Cevik, 60 Kuppalli, Kindrachuk, & Peiris, 2020; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Petersen et al., 2020) but both use 61 the human ACE2 protein as a viral entry receptor (W. Li et al., 2003) and share approximately 62 75% similarity overall in Spike at an amino acid level (Gralinski & Menachery, 2020).

Similarly, two 76 further variants have been identified in South Africa, 501Y.V2, and Brazil, P.1, which carry 77 additional mutations in both the NTD and RBD (Faria et al., 2021; Tegally et al., 2020). All three 78 variants share a deletion of 3 amino acids in Orf1ab and key mutations in the RBD (E484K and 79 the N501Y); data so far consistent with convergent evolution. Early reports have indicated that 80 while the RBD mutation N501Y in the B.1.1.7 strain does not compromise post vaccine serum 81 neutralization (Xie et al., 2021), one of the individual changes in the 501Y.V2 strain does impair 82 neutralization but does not remove all activity (Greaney et al., 2021). Moreover, in vitro escape 83 studies have shown similar mutations occur under selective pressure (Andreano et al., 2020). 84 Therefore, in this study we evaluated the potential role of individual amino acids in 85 facilitating escape from neutralizing antibodies. Firstly, by making a series of point mutations to 86 change the amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 to those found at the analogous position in SARS-CoV. 87 Secondly, by making individual point mutations emerging in real world populations and by 88 generating a pseudotype virus using the B.1.1.7 variant Spike sequence. We identify multiple 89 mutations that can abrogate neutralization by some monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD 90 of Spike. However, in contrast, we show that serum responses are more resilient to these 91 mutations, especially following severe infection where the antibody response is of potential escape mutants by SARS-CoV amino acids substitution 95 There are 56 individual amino acid changes between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 96 (Ortega, Serrano, Pujol, & Rangel, 2020), including sites at which antibody escape has been 97 observed for SARS-CoV (Rockx et al., 2010). We identified 15 sites where single, or sequential, 98 non-conservative amino acid changes were observed compared to SARS-CoV. These sites were 99 mutated in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike to match SARS-CoV (Fig S1). Mutated Spike protein plasmids 100 were then co-transfected with a lentiviral construct encoding luciferase and a packaging 101 plasmid to produce pseudotyped viruses (Seow et al., 2020). Three of the substitutions 102 resulted in virus that did not give sufficient titer to evaluate the impact on neutralization 4 activity. The remaining mutated pseudotypes were then screened for any mAbs (I, III, IV, VI, VII, IX, X, XI), five of which target the RBD (I, III, VI, VII, 108 IX), and three clusters contain only non-neutralizing mAbs (II, V and VIII). Representatives of 109 each neutralizing cluster were selected for evaluation against the Spike mutant pseudotypes. 110 Impact of SARS-CoV Spike substitutions on SARS-CoV-2 mAb neutralization 111 Initial screening assays of the twelve infectious viral pseudotype mutants showed no effect 112 on neutralization by any of the mAbs against three mutants with changes at amino acid 113 positions RFA346-8KFP, S459G, and ST477-8GK (FigS1). In contrast, the remaining nine viral 114 pseudotype mutants diminished neutralization for at least one mAb (Fig1) as described below: 115 P384A 116 The P384A substitution resulted in complete loss of neutralization by COVA1-16 (Fig1A), a 117 cluster III RBD-specific mAb that allosterically competes with ACE2 rather than directly 118 blocking the binding site (Liu et al., 2020). Of note, this mutation has been described and 119 structurally characterized elsewhere (Wu et al., 2020), revealing that this proline to alanine 120 change results in a relatively small alteration in protein structure that can enable SARS-CoV 121 mAbs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 P384A. However, P384A does not weaken neutralization by any 122 other mAbs, including another mAb in the cluster III competition group. 123 K417V 124 The K417V mutation results in a pseudotyped virus that is less susceptible to COVA2-07 125 mediated neutralization, which is the other cluster III RBD-specific mAb screened (Fig1A). 126 COVA2-07 belongs to the same sub-cluster as COVA2-04, the structure of which has been solved 127 and contact residues include numerous bonded and non-bonded contacts within the RBD and 128 ACE2-binding site (Wu et al., 2020). That this mutation should alter mAbs such as COVA2-07, 129 which competes directly with ACE2 for binding, is not unexpected as the lysine at position 417 130 forms a hydrogen bond with ACE2 (Lan et al., 2020) that is likely disrupted by this substitution. 131 We then evaluated an additional mAb, COVA2-04, from the same competitive binding cluster as 132 COVA2-07. This is because COVA2-04 is representative of class of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing 133 antibodies that all use the VH3-53 gene and have been suggested to be an unusual \"public\" or 134 stereotyped antibody (Cao et al., 2020; Mor et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020). COVA2-04 was 135 not able to neutralize the K417V pseudotype (data not shown). Although, of note, this mutation 136 has no real impact on neutralization by any of the other mAbs tested. the other mAbs is largely unaffected despite the alteration of three sequential amino 142 acids. This may be explained by the relatively minor differences in the amino acid side chains at 143 the mutated residues. Unlike some of the other mutants tested, such as LF455YL that introduces 144 a phenol, the substitutions made here may not disrupt protein structure or antibody binding to 145 any great extent. Notably, binding analysis has suggested mutations in this loop can reduce RBD 146 binding by Spike-specific sera (Greaney et al.is situated directly within the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the RBD. It 149 renders pseudotyped virus resistant to neutralization by the cluster I mAb COVA2-29, but does 150 not affect the other cluster I mAb COVA1-18 or any other mAb tested. 151 LF455YL 152 This double substitution reduces neutralization by RBD-specific mAbs from different clusters, 153 specifically, the cluster I mAb COVA2-29, cluster III mAb COVA2-07 and cluster VI mAb COVA1-154 12 (Fig1A, B). For COVA1-12 all neutralization activity is abolished, while COVA2-07 activity is 155 just below the level required to calculate an IC50 value. 156 TEI470-2NVP 157 This triple mutation is located in a loop within the RBM where other substitutions have been 158 reported to abolish ACE2 binding (Xu et al., 2021; Yi et al., 2020). This mutation prevents 159 neutralization by COVA2-29 (cluster I), COVA2-07 (cluster III) and COVA2-02 (cluster VII). It 160 also reduces the activity of the most potent mAb COVA1-18 (cluster I) by 3-fold, whereas this 161 mAb is only minimally affected by other mutations. Moreover, TEI470-2NVP lowers the potency 162 of the structurally unmapped non-RBD cluster XI mAb, COVA1-21, to the limit of detection. 163 Thus, this mutation negatively impacts the most mAbs, including representatives from substitution towards the end of the RBM destroys neutralization activity by both 167 COVA2-29 (cluster I) and COVA1-12 (cluster VI) but does not have a major impact on the other 168 cluster I mAb tested or those from other epitope clusters. 169 In summary, different mAbs can lose their neutralization activity when confronted with 170 different Spike mutations and the effects are not strictly delineated by binding clusters, such 6 that mAbs within the same competition cluster are frequently differentially affected. , with substantial loss of some neutralizing activity against four mutations 176 (L452K, LF455YL, TEI470-2NVP, S494D), which are all within the RBM of the RBD (Fig1A). COVA2-29 177 is also known to compete directly with ACE2 for binding to Spike, which may explain why it is 178 sensitive to so many different mutations within the RBM. 179 Impact of Spike mutations on serum neutralization 180 Following the identification of Spike mutations that can limit or abrogate neutralizing 181 activity of mAbs (Fig2A), the next step was to assess the impact of these mutations on serum 182 neutralization. Samples were tested following two different infection scenarios. Firstly, from a 183 previously characterized cohort of seropositive healthcare workers who experienced mild or 184 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (Houlihan et al., 2020). Secondly, sera were obtained from 185 a cohort of hospitalized patients who experienced severe disease. Eighteen samples were 186 chosen from both cohorts for screening purposes to obtain representatives with intermediate 187 (1:50-100), strong (1:100-1000) and potent (>1:1000) neutralizing ID50 values. The median 188 serum ID50 for hospitalized patients selected was 1:1275, and that for selected 189 mild/asymptomatic cases was 1:1045. Strikingly, serum samples from both cohorts are less 190 impacted by Spike mutations than individual mAbs in terms of fold decrease in neutralization 191 potency (Fig2B and C). Only one of thirty-six serum samples lost all neutralizing activity (Fig 192 S2), in contrast to the five mAbs from five different epitope clusters where neutralization was 193 completely abrogated by a single Spike mutation (Fig 1B). Moreover, fold-decrease in 194 neutralization potency was more modest for sera than mAbs, with an average 2-fold decrease 195 across all sera for the most disadvantageous mutation TEI470-2NVP as compared to a more than 196 100-fold decrease observed for several of the mAbs (Fig2B and C). Interestingly, none of the 36 197 serum samples lost >5-fold potency against the other triple substitution, KVG444-6TST which 198 contrasts with recent data showing a single mutation at G446 caused a major loss of 199 neutralization in one sample (Greaney et al., 2021). Importantly, there was notable difference 200 between the resilience of serum samples from severely ill hospitalised individuals and those 201 who had experienced mild/asymptomatic infection. Only two serum sample from a hospitalised 202 individual lost more than 3-fold potency against any individual mutant (Fig2C, FigS2). Whereas 203 approximately half (10 of 18) the mild/asymptomatic serum samples showed a three-fold drop 204 in potency against at least one Spike mutant (Fig2C, Fig S2). 205 Greater levels of Spike-reactive antibodies in sera after severe illness 7 The differences in resilience to Spike mutations seen in the neutralizing sera from these 207 two infection scenarios is plausibly due to greater polyclonality arising from greater antigenic 208 stimulation during severe illness. To assess the serological profiles of these two cohorts, we 209 compared the 50% inhibitory dilution (ID50) values across 192 samples and measured the 210 binding titers by semi-quantitative ELISA for 199 samples as previously described (Ng et al., 211 2020; O'Nions et al., 2020). There is a significantly higher median IgG binding titer of 46.5 212 \u03bcg/ml following severe illness versus 3.9 \u03bcg/ml following mild/asymptomatic disease (Fig3A, 213 FigS3). Similarly, there is a significantly higher median ID50 value in the hospitalized patient 214 cohort as compared to the mild/asymptomatic group (Fig3B). This shows, as has been 215 observed previously (Seow et al., 2020), that severely ill patients have higher binding and 216 neutralization titers than asymptomatic/mild cases and that higher binding titers correlate 217 with greater neutralization. However, when considering how the IgG binding titer from each 218 individual relates to their neutralization titer it became clear that there was a discrepancy 219 (Fig3C and D). Most hospitalized patients required a binding titer of greater than 10 \u03bcg/ml to 220 achieve strong neutralization (ID50 >100). Moreover, mild infections could lead to potent 221 neutralization (ID50 >1000) at binding titers of less than 10 \u03bcg/ml (Fig3D) whereas this was 222 observed for only two individuals following severe illness (Fig3C). In fact, the amount of 223specific IgG present at the serum ID50 is significantly higher in severe illness compared to mild 224 disease (Fig 3E). This suggests that a higher proportion of antibodies are non-neutralizing 225 following severe illness. However, the total level of specific antibodies is so high that the 226 number of neutralizing antibodies following severe illness may be greater and explain the 227 relative resilience of severe sera to Spike mutations.228Impact of Spike variants on mAb and serum neutralization229Investigating the ability of post-SARS-CoV-2-infection mAbs and serum to cope with 230 mutations in Spike engineered based on differences with SARS-CoV was a rational first 231 approach to study escape, because these mutations were likely to form viable Spike proteins.232 Indeed, some of the positions at which amino acids were mutated, as described above, have 233 now been observed to be a site of variance in SARS-CoV-2 across the human population (Q. Li et 234 al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Starr et al., 2020). However, additional viral variants, not linked to 235 points of variance between these two closely related viruses, have started to emerge on a 236 significant scale (Q. Li et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020). Firstly, the D614G mutation, observed 237 in western Europe in February 2020 and now dominant across the globe (Korber et al., 2020).",

Li et al., 2020; Plante et al., 2020) and somewhat increases the ability of 240 serum and mAbs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (Korber et al., 2020; Plante et al., 2020; Weissman et 241 al., 2020). More recently, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7) has emerged in England and 8 been associated with a rapid rise in case numbers (S. Kemp et al., 2020; Rambaut et al.al., 2020). Therefore, these changes were introduced in the Wuhan strain Spike in 247 the presence of D614G to produce pseudotyped viruses for neutralization sensitivity analysis. 248 Firstly, \u0394H69/V70 did not negatively impact the neutralization potency for most of the mAbs 249 tested, including cluster IX mAb COVA2-17 (Fig4A), which has recently been found to bind the 250 NTD (Rosa et al., 2021). The exception was the structurally unmapped COVA1-21 (cluster XI), 251 which was previously reported to lose partial potency against this deletion in the context of 252 other mutations that arose in an immuno-compromised patient (S. A. Kemp et al., 2020). 253 Similarly, the serum neutralization activity did not decrease by more than 3-fold relative to the 254 D614G Spike for any individual sample (Fig4B). In contrast, the introduction of the N501Y 255 substitution (observed in both B.1.1.7, 501Y.V2 and P.1) lowered the neutralization potency of 256 one mAb, COVA1-12, to the limit of the assay, with a fold decrease in IC50 of >40 (Fig4A). This 257 cluster VI RBD-specific mAb was also negatively impacted by proximal mutations at LF455YL 258 and S494D. Moreover, a 5-fold decrease in potency was observed against the N501Y pseudotype 259 for the cluster IX mAb COVA2-17, which also loses efficacy against TEI470-2NVP. However, as 260 seen for the other mutations that abrogate mAb function, the N501Y change had less of an effect 261 on the sera obtained after both severe and mild infection, with all individual serum samples 262 remaining within three-fold of their original ID50 value (Fig4B, FigS4).",

This showed that, as per individual mutants, B.1.1.7 can lessen the potency of 267 some mAbs, although unlike other mutations described above, it does not remove all activity 268 for any individual mAb and in total three mAbs were affected, COVA2-17, COVA1-12 and 269 COVA1-21 (Fig4A). These mAbs belong to distinct clusters and so do not compete for binding to 270 the same epitope. Firstly, the cluster IX mAb COVA2-17 showed an approximate 5-fold drop in 271 potency against both the N501Y single mutant and the B.1.1.7 pseudotype, implying this loss of 272 potency is primarily N501Y driven. In contrast, the decrease in potency noted with the single 273 N501Y change for the RBD-specific mAb COVA1-12 was lessened in the context of B.1.1.7, with a 274 11-fold rather than a >40-fold drop in neutralization. Furthermore, one mAb, COVA1-21 275 experienced a substantial drop in potency against B.1.1.7 compared to the single mutants or the 276 D614G spike. This cluster XI mAb, which does not bind to RBD or S1 subunits, showed more than 277 100-fold reduction in potency. This effect is likely in part mediated by the \u0394H69/V70 deletion 9 that also reduced the potency of COVA1-21 when evaluated as a single mutant. The B.from hospitalized patients was a 9.1-fold change, but most of the samples showed 283 minimal change in the potency of their neutralization. Overall, three samples from each cohort 284 (8%) showed a 5-10-fold reduction, but as they were potently neutralizing sera, the reduced 285 ID50 values were still >1:100. Similarly, another four samples from both cohorts (demonstrates that Spike mutations can diminish or abolish neutralizing activity by 291 individual mAbs but that serum neutralization is less strongly affected. Notably, only one 292 engineered mutation, and none of the observed Spike mutants or the B.1.1.7 variant, resulted in 293 a complete escape from neutralizing activity and this was only seen for one out of thirty-six 294 serum samples. The Spike mutants evaluated comprise seven substitutions designed to mimic 295 possible escape changes based on homology with SARS-CoV, two observed high-frequency 296 mutations and the B.1.1.7 Spike variant.

These include, K417V that had a negative effect on mAb 312 neutralization and another mutation at this position, K417N, has been observed in the 04-like antibodies are thought to be widespread among the seropositive population and 318 so the K417V would be predicted to have an impact on sera from many individuals. Interestingly, 319 serum samples from mild infection showed very little change in neutralization potency against 320 this mutation. However, the strongest effect on serum samples from mild infection was 321 mediated by the TEI470-2NVP substitution, which is part of what has been termed the RBD 322 binding ridge, and other mutations in this region can decrease serum neutralization (Greaney 323 et al., 2021). As such, any mutation in this zone should be closely monitored in viral populations 324 due to the potential for escape. However, it is encouraging that the effect of these mutations on 325 sera was much less pronounced and that individual mAbs within the same clusters were not 326 universally inactivated by any given mutation. Notably, the mutations that most substantially 327 decrease serum neutralization are those that negatively impact mAb activity against the widest 328 range of clusters (I, III, XI, IX and VI) suggesting that mAb screening is a useful proxy for 329 potential serum effects if a range of antibody clones are used. However, the capacity to predict 330 the in vivo impact of a drop in neutralization potency requires correlation of in vitro serum 331 neutralization ID50 values with protection, which thus far has only been achieved in animal 332 models where, encouragingly, an ID50 value of 1:50 was found to be protective (McMahan et al.to the first part of this study is that only RBD substitutions were considered. 335 Further studies to assess potential mutations before they arise should include those in NTD 336 given the emerging importance of NTD as a site for neutralizing antibodies (Andreano et al., 337 2020; Rosa et al., 2021). However, it should be noted that one RBD change, TEI470-2NVP, 338 resulted in a 24-fold drop in potency for COVA1-21, which does not bind RBD and remains 339 structurally unmapped (Brouwer et al., 2020). Regardless, that sera likely containing a mixture 340 of RBD-and NTD-specificities are more resilient than individual mAbs in the face of Spike 341 mutations within the RBD is not surprising. This further highlights the importance of a broad 342 polyclonal serum response to maintain neutralizing activity in the event of novel Spike 343 mutations emerging, and the need to consider more than RBD binding in if the conclusions from studying the impact of the SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV 346 substitutions on neutralization parallel those of real-world Spike mutations, we examined the 347 responses to the newly emerged B.1.1.7 variant (S. Kemp et al., 2020; Rambaut et al., 2020). other substitutions, this did not translate to any large effect on serum potency. Of 353 note, we have not studied changes at position 484 that have been observed in 501Y.V2 and P.1 354 and reported to reduce neutralization in serum samples (Greaney et al., 2021) and during in 355 vitro escape (Andreano et al., 2020). Further studies of mutations at position 484 and new 356 emerging mutations will be needed. This would best be facilitated by large, curated panels of 357 mAbs and pools of sera from individuals with different infection/vaccination trajectories. 358 Theoretically it is likely that combinations of mutations have more potential to lead to loss 359 of serum activity than individual single amino acid changes by destroying multiple parts of key 360 epitopes. This has partially been observed in terms of the new B.1.1.7 Spike pseudotype 361 analyzed here. Only one mAb was more dramatically affected by the full set of B.1.1.7 362 mutations. However, the small number of serum samples with reduced neutralization relative 363 to the D614G virus, were more strongly affected by B.1.1.7 than either the \u0394H69/V70 or N501Y 364 mutations individually (Fig 4B). This reduced neutralization was seen in 11% (3-5-fold) and 365 8% (5-10-fold) when tested against the B.1.1.7 Spike pseudotype. However, all of the affected 366 samples were still able to neutralize B.1.1.7, and the average reduced serum ID50 value was 367 1:522. This is ten-times higher than the reported serum ID50 correlate of protection in animal 368 studies and suggests these responses would likely still be effective against infection in the data observed with B.1.1.7 and the two individual mutations 371 \u0394H69/V70 or N501Y highlight the importance of testing emerging variants in the full form. 372 Moreover, this approach may be important as combinations of mutations could enable 373 individual antibody escape mutations that are disadvantageous for transmission to be 374 propagated. For example, a residue such as S494 is involved both in ACE2 binding (Xu et al., 375 2021) and mAb neutralization (Fig1). Therefore, a mutation at S494 could decrease antibody 376 function but also decrease host receptor recognition and limit infectivity. However, the 377 detrimental effects of the mutation on infectivity could be compensated for if a S494 mutation 378 occurred in concert with a mutation that strengthened a different part of the viral entry 379 pathway as has been suggested(S. A. Kemp et al., 2020). This highlights the need for rapid 380 evaluation of variant strains upon emergence, potentially accelerated by computational 381 modeling based on prior knowledge of the effects of individual changes. 12 In conclusion, this study underlines both the potential for escape from neutralizing 383 antibodies due to mutations in Spike and the relative resilience of serum responses compared 384 to individual mAbs. This difference likely derives from the breadth inherent in polyclonal sera 385 as compared to the precision interaction of a given mAb. Our results suggest that the majority 386 of vaccine responses should be effective against the B.1.1.7 variant as the sera evaluated were 387 obtained after infection early in the pandemic when the commonly circulating virus was highly 388 similar in sequence to the vaccines now being deployed. A reduction in potency was observed 389 in a minority of samples tested against B.1.1.7, however, neutralization titers remained above 390 1:200 in almost all cases. Finally, it is probable that as SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity increases 391 across the human population (due to both vaccination efforts and natural infection) there could 392 eventually be selection for Spike mutations that result in substantial antigenic drift as seen for 393 Influenza. If and when this will happen is unpredictable given the current scale of ongoing 394 transmission worldwide. The data herein suggest evaluation of neutralizing mAbs from non-395 overlapping binding clusters can highlight which Spike mutations will most impact sera 396 neutralization. Greater knowledge of the molecular epitopes recognized by individual mAbs 397 and their relative immunodominance within sera is needed urgently. This is because 398 understanding of rules of engagement for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies is a crucial 399 component of preparedness for major antigenic changes and long-term management of 400 coronaviruses globally. Our findings stress the importance of continuous monitoring of variants 401 and in vitro assessment of their impact on neutralization. This is particularly relevant for the 402 use of convalescent plasma and the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies as samples were collected as previously described (Houlihan et al., 2020). Data 470 derives from samples from 81 seropositive individuals during the first four months since 471 infection. The study protocol was approved by the NHS Health Research Authority (ref 472 20/SC/0147) on 26 March 2020. Ethical oversight was provided by the South-Central 473 Berkshire Research Ethics Committee. Serum samples from hospitalised patients were 474 obtained during their hospital stay and through the Tissue Access for Patient Benefit (TAPb) 475 scheme at The Royal Free Hospital (approved by UCL-Royal Free Hospital BioBank Ethical 476 Review Committee Reference number: NC2020.24 NRES EC number: 16/WA/0289).",

However, the role of the recently described respiratory viruses is not yet fully understood. Objective The main objective of this study was to estimate the frequency of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and 14 other respiratory viruses in hospitalized children with acute wheezing. Methods A prospective study was conducted on children <14 years old, admitted with an acute expiratory wheezing episode from September 2005 to June 2008. Viruses were detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates by polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were prospectively recorded. Results A viral pathogen was identified in 444 (71%) out of 626 hospitalized acute wheezing episodes. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected (27%), followed by rhinovirus (24%), adenovirus (17.8%), HBoV (16%), and HMPV (4.7%). The rate of viral detection was significantly higher in infants (77.3%), than in older children (59.8%) (P < 0.001). RSV and HBoV were more prevalent in infants (P < 0.001) than in older children. Conclusion The most prevalent viruses found in severe acute wheezing episodes were RSV and rhinovirus not only in childhood, but also in infancy. However, other emerging viruses such as HBoV and metapneumovirus also play an important role in wheezing episodes.

Our data confirm that adenovirus can mimic bacterial infection in previously healthy children that often results in inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Identifying adenovirus infections would affect care favorably. 23 In this study, HMPV was detected in 4.7% of the total study population and was the fifth respiratory virus in both, infants and children. Although initial reports questioned the role of HMPV in wheezing episodes, our results and those of other authors 5, 8, [24] [25] [26] [27] have clarified this issue, showing clearly that HMPV is involved, at least, in the most severe wheezing episodes, requiring hospital admission. Coronaviruses were identified in 1.4% of wheezing episodes. As it has been previously suggested, 28 our data confirms that coronaviruses may be associated with more severe symptoms in young children. However, no conclusion can be drawn on the clinical role played by coronaviruses on the basis of our data. Only larger studies would provide some information at these low prevalences. Noticeably, it does not appear that influenza was a substantial contributor to severe wheezing episodes in Spain from 2005 to 2008, as it was one of the less frequent viruses detected in our wheezy hospitalized group. Similar results have been reported by Chung et al. 19 in Korea.

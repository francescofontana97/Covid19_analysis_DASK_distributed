The key idea of this method consist in constructing an equivalent electrical circuit that has the same immittance as an investigated sample. For example, a suitable equivalent circuit for an ideal semiconductor diode is a serial RC-circuit, because the pn-junction has zero conductivity at constant current and high conductivity at highfrequency current [48] (here we assume that EV has small amplitude and rectification effects are eliminated). As a result, we can associate the capacitance in equivalent circuit with a space charge region of pn-junction, and the resistance in the equivalent circuit with the bulk resistance of the diode base. Alternatively, for a living cell membrane, a suitable equivalent circuit is the parallel RC-circuit, because it has low (but non-zero) conductivity at constant current and very high conductivity at high-frequency current.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 173, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 174, "end": 176, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 533, "end": 537, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The concept of equivalent circuits"}, {"text": "Here, the capacitor corresponds to the geometrical capacitance of the cell membrane, and the resistor corresponds to the resistance of the membrane.

Nyquist plot is in fact a paramteric plot of these two function with the parameter being a frequency. As an example for this procedure, let's consider a serial RC circuit (see Table 1 ). Its impedance and admittance are described as", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 512, "end": 519, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "The concept of equivalent circuits"}, {"text": "where R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance. At low frequencies the impedance of the capacitor is high, and the Bode diagram demonstrates hyperbolic behavior. At high frequencies the impedance of the capacitor is low, and the total impedance is determined by the resistance R and it does not depend on frequency. The Nyquist admittance diagram of the serial RC-circuit has a semi-circle shape (see Table 1 ) with a radius 1/R and centered at point 1/(2R) + i \u00b7 0, which easy to show by taking the magnitude of the quantity Y \u2212 1/(2R). Thus, if the Nyquist admittance plot of a measured sample has a semi-circle shape, it is highly likely that the sample can be represented as a serial RC-circuit. A question can arise: why for a serial RC-circuit we consider admittance locus instead impedance locus, which has a much simpler shape (the line parallel to the imaginary axis at the distance R)? The answer to this question is as follows: the admittance representation is very useful in case of the parallel connection of N serial RC-circuits (see last line in Table 1 ). Indeed, the admittance locus of such system is a vector sum of all RC-circuit loci, and, as a result, the total locus will have a shape of N overlapped semicircles. The analogical shape will be observed for impedance of the serial connected parallel RC-circuits. So, the Nyquist plot allows us to determine how many RC-circuits we should take into account to construct the equivalent circuit. Thus, the immittance plotting can be a key for choosing the best equivalent circuit topology. When the equivalent circuit for the sample is constructed, its parameters (ratings of resistance, capacitance, etc) should be tuned to match the equivalent-circuit spectrum to the experimentally observed spectrum. To perform this task three methods are commonly used: geometric method [52] , algebraic method (AM) [53] , and complex non-linear least squares (CNLS) method [52, 54, 55] . In geometric approach, which was used in the early EIS studies, the graphical operations with the immittance locus are performed to evaluate equivalent circuit parameters. For a more accurate algebraic approach, the parameters of the equivalent circuit are calculated based on the characteristics of immittance spectrum, i.e. the numerical parameters such as minima, maxima, inflection points, etc are analyzed and used for the calculation of equivalent circuit parameters.

Levie model of an electrode with a scratch on its surface [71] . For simplicity, we will deal with the limiting case of the Levie model, when a scratch has infinite depth and degenerates into the pore [see Fig. 3 (a), the direction from right to left corresponds to going deeper to pore along its central axis]. To calculate the immittance of this system, the so-called transmissionline approximation approach can be used. Let's divide the pore across its symmetry axis into parts with infinitely small length (Fig. 3) . One can see that the current J n that flows through the cross-section resistance of the n-th section is formed by the sum of the current J n\u22121 in the (n \u2212 1)-th section and the current J \u22a5 n that flows through the metal/electrolyte impedance (which we assume to be capacitive). The current that flows through the n-th section is added to the similar current J n+1 that flows through the (n + 1)-th section resistance, and so on (J n+1 = J n + J \u22a5 n+1 , J n+2 = J n+1 + J \u22a5 n+2 , etc).

One of the most popular qualitative equivalent circuits for the metal/electrolyte/cell interface is the ECIS model proposed by I. Giaever and C. Keese [16] . To better understand its origin, the Table 2 lists the most significant properties of the MEC contact. From data given in this table, one can see that a cell itself is a very strong dielectric: at low frequencies a cell impedance is higher than the impedance of the pure metal-electrolyte interface. This picture is due to the lipid-based composition of a membrane and the very selective ion channels in the form of proteins [77] . So, in fact one can neglect current flow through cell at low frequencies. At the same time, we can notice that cells are attached to the electrode surface by so-called focal contacts, i.e. the most part of cell membrane does not have a direct contact with the electrode surface [78] . Thus, between cell's membrane and electrode surface exist an effective seal. The Giaever-Keese model is based on this statement [16, 20] . In order to pass the metal/electrolyte/cell interface the current has to overcome the electrochemical impedance Z m/e [Eq. (23), Fig. 4(a) , left panel] and also the resistance of the seal between the cell and the electrode surface [ Fig. 4(a) , center panel].

Frequency-domain methods use a sine-shaped excitation voltage at a single frequency [ Fig. 5(a) ], and immittance is measured in a step-wise frequency-by-frequency manner [3] . The advantages of frequency-domain approaches include high noise-immunity and the simplicity of experimental setups. However, a fundamental drawback of these approaches is a very low measurement rate. In time-domain methods, the sample is scanned simultaneously at all frequencies from a broad frequency region of interest by using EV with wide spectrum [5, 83, 84] .

These studies are usually based on the ECIS-type electrodes geometry, where cells are grown on the planar electrodes located on the bottom of the modified Petri dish (see Sec. 2.3.3). The analysis of time-resolved electrodes immittance response allows the researchers to estimate the number of cells on the electrode, the motility or viability of cells, etc. Up to date, two commercially-available systems that can be used to perform this tasks exist: ECIS (Applied Biophysics, USA) and xCelligence (ACEA Bioscience, USA). Further we will deal with last one device. Despite of the xCelligence in fact produces immittance measurement at the only one frequency (10 kHz, [94] ), and thus it generally speaking it is not spectroscope, it can be successfully used in number of the actual cells-research applications.

It depicts the impedance evolutions of two electrodes: one is covered with cells and another is the control one (cells-free). One can see that the Cell Index of the empty electrode is stable in time, however, the Cell Index of the cell-covered electrode demonstrates a logistic rise [96] , which is related to cell fission and growth. So, the data presented in Fig. 8 qualitatively confirms the Giaever-Keese model. Another important bio-EIS application for cell research is the identification of the cell state. As an example, we will describe an experiment that was performed both with the xCelligence device and with a home-built device based on the multielectrode array 60StimMEA200/30-Ti (Multichannel Systems, Germany) and the adaptive filtering for signal analysis [85] . As a sample we again have used the HeLa cancer cells. The experimental protocol was trivial: we measured the immittance of the metal/electrolyte/cell interface before and after the addition of the toxin Triton x100 (Union Carbide, USA) to cell medium. The results are presented on Figs. 9 and 10. As one can see from Fig. 9 the Cell Indexes measured by xCelligence before and after the addition of the toxin are distinctly different. This effect is confirms Giaever-Keese model: due to membrane distortion of dead cells the electrode covered with them has lower impedance compared to the electrode covered with alive cells (see Fig. 4 ). Thus the EIS allows for distinguishing between dead and alive cells. However, xCelligence provides measurements only at a single frequency, and for this reason, it does not provide a reliable cell viability estimation. I.e., a picture similar to the Fig. 9 can be obtained by destroying the dielectric coating of the electrodes or by increasing the conductivity of cell medium after a toxin addition. To significantly increase the reliability of EIS as a method for estimating cell viability, one has to perform measurements in a broad frequency range and to use the control (empty) electrode that is located in the same medium [97] .

To summarize, the EIS-based virus sensing technologies provide a hopeful tool for fighting with various virus diseases like immunodeficiency syndrome, dengue virus-infection, and, highly likely, COVID19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 238, "end": 242, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 243, "end": 246, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 247, "end": 250, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 494, "end": 498, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 523, "end": 527, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 552, "end": 556, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 644, "end": 648, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 735, "end": 738, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 841, "end": 845, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 846, "end": 849, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 850, "end": 853, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 854, "end": 857, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 858, "end": 861, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 862, "end": 865, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1443, "text": "[113,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1448, "text": "114]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1813, "text": "[115,", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1818, "text": "116,", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1823, "text": "117]", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1917, "text": "[118,", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1918, "end": 1922, "text": "119]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 988, "end": 994, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Bio-matter and biosensorics"}, {"text": "Finally, it is worth mentioning that EIS can be used to study cell membranes in combination with patch-clamp technology [120] . In this diagnostic technique, a cell membrane is attached to the glass microtube with a diameter of \u223c \u00b5m that is filled with electrolyte. Two AgCl electrodes are placed in the microtube and the cell medium, and the impedance is measured between these electrodes. Because the impedance of the membrane is significantly higher than the impedance of the electrodes/electrolyte interface (Tab. 2), its value will define the immittance between the electrodes. As a result, the combination of a patch-clamp with EIS allows the researchers to evaluate the conductivity of the cell membrane, the resistivity of ion channels in cell membrane and other important electrical characteristics of a cell. For example, in Ref. [87] this technique based on Fourier-EIS allowed the authors to detect that living neurons can regulate their capacitance in response to changes of membrane area.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 125, "text": "[120]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 840, "end": 844, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Bio-matter and biosensorics"}, {"text": "In this tutorial article, we reviewed modern electrical impedance spectroscopy from the theoretical and experimental points of view, paying special attention to its applications in cell research, medicine, including viruses and cancer study, and biosensing. We hope that this article will be useful for students as rapid introduction to EIS as well as for scientists and engineers as EIS handbook. Nevertheless, we do not expect that our study can completely replace classical and modern works on EIS. For further reading, the following papers can be used. The books by E. Barsoukov and J. Ross Macdonald [3] and V.F. Lvovich [4] thoroughly describe electrical impedance spectroscopy and its application for electrochemistry. The book by S. Grimnes and O.G. Martinsen contains a lot of information about bio-impedance [6] . The review [5] by B.Y. Chang and S.M. Park is devoted to modern high-speed EIS technique based on Fourier transformation. The description of another high-speed technique, adaptive filtering EIS, can be found in the article [85] . The article [54] by J. Ross Macdonald is devoted to complex non-linear least-squares approximation -a state-of-art tool for EIS spectra analysis. Chapters 3.4 and 7 in Ref. [18] by P. Wang and Q. Liu contain information on biosensorics based on EIS. The book [17] by Wen G. Jiang contains information about cellular biology research conducted with EIS. The review by R.H. Bayford is concerned with the progress in impedance tomography. Titche and Shnek book [50] introduces the reader into EIS basics and its measuring equipment. The most simple and elegant introduction into EIS can be found in Richard Feynman's lectures [49] in chapter 25-5. according to the research project 18-32-00363.

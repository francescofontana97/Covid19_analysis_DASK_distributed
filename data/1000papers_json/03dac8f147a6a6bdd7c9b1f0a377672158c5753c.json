Initially, animals arrived at the animal aging facility at Veterans Administration Medical Center between January and April, 1984 and were housed 1 or 2 per plastic cage (19 x 10.5 x 8 inches) containing a cellulose bedding derived from clean corn cobs (Andersons Lab Division, Maumee, OH). Subsequent animals, arriving at the aging facility in January 1986 were housed in cages containing a hardwood bedding material (Beta-Chip, Northeastern Products Corp., Warrenburg, NY). The temperature in this facility was maintained at 22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C and light were automatically controlled for a 12:12 hr light (0600-1800 h)/dark cycle. The animals in this facility were monitored for rate of body growth and inspected routinely for health status. Sentinel rodents in the colony were periodically tested for titers against viral pathogens ( , but all animals were negative for the remaining agents. All animals were judged to be in good health until the end of the study, at which time they were killed and necropsy not performed. All laboratory rats at our animal facilities are fed Purina laboratory chow #5012 which contains 22.8% protein, 52.1% carbohydrate, 4.5% fat, 4.6% fiber, and vitamins and minerals in amounts to meet requirements for rats. At approximately 12 months of age, rats were divided into four groups. The first group consisted of 8 control rats (C A ) that were used to assess insulin-stimulated glucose uptake at baseline at 12 months of age. The second group consisted of a separate group of 8 control (C B ) rats, maintained in normal laboratory cages (1 or 2 rats/cage) and fed the same laboratory chow diet for an additional 3 to 4 months. A third group of 7 rats (ET) were placed individually in motorized exercise wheel cages (Wahmann; Timonium, MD), fed the chow diet, and trained to run for 4 months as described below in detail. A fourth group consisted of 7 rats fed a calorie-reduced diet (CR) for 3 to 4 months to maintain body weight comparable to the exercised trained rats. The diet consisted of either a 1:1 or 1:2 mixture by weight of Purina laboratory meal and powdered cellulose, respectively, with increased vitamin content to compensate for caloric dilution. This food was pelleted by the manufacturer (Purina Test Diets, Richmond, IN).

As illustrated by Figure 1 , cages were further modified for this study by connecting the axle of each wheel to a 1/50 hp motor (Bodine, Model 529) and a clutch permitting clockwise rotation of the wheel following start of the motor. The speed of wheel rotation on each cage was adjusted by a speed controller (Bodine, Model 901) wired to the motor. The start and duration of rotation for each cage was regulated by a programmable timer (Minarik Micromaster, model WP 6001) connected to each of the motorized units. This timer was programmed with a series of on-off operations at selected intervals as described in the following paragraph. The number of daily rotations was recorded by rubber wedge attached to the wheel of the cage which deflected a lever on a cyclometer placed on the frame of the cage. As illustrated schematically in Figure 1 , the inside frame of the wheel, covered initially with rubber latex tubing, was covered with copper tubing to cover the sharp edge of the rim. In addition, a metal ring spacer was placed on the inside frame of the wheel covering the axle. At the start of the training program we noted that some animals would attempt to sit on the axle during rotation of the wheel, resulting in injuries to the appendages of these rats and the need to terminate the training period. Subsequently, we found that these injuries could be avoided entirely by placing not only the spacer on the axle of the wheel, but also by replacing the latex tubing on the inside edge of the wheel with a permanent copper tubing. This latter addition permitted the wheel to rotate in closer proximity to the facing of the cage, which prevented either food pellets from jamming the wheel or the animals' appendages from being caught between the wheel and the cage facing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 248, "end": 269, "text": "(Mondon et al., 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 270, "end": 290, "text": "Mondon et al., 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 311, "end": 319, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1139, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "MATERIALS AND METHODS"}, {"text": "Training program. -The start of training was initiated by placing 12-month-rats in the exercise wheel cages for 2 to 3 days for acclimation. The motors were individually turned on for 4 to 5 seconds to train the animals to orient themselves in the correct direction. This was repeated until the animals began walking in a direction opposite to the rotation of the wheel. At that time, the speed of revolutions per minute was maintained low (4 to 5 revolutions/min) and the duration was increased progressively. When the animals were able to walk for a 15 min period each hour, the speed of rotation was progressively increased to 12 revolutions/min. When this speed was tolerated for 15 min/hr for 2 or 3 consecutive hours during the day, the programmer was set to start cage rotation at 6 P.M. Initially, the cages were set to run 15 min/hr for 2 hr/night, and was progressively increased for an additional hour each night until the animals were running for 15 min/hr for 12 consecutive hours between 6 P.M. and 6 A.M. To alert the animals to the start of exercise, the motor was turned on for 4 s followed by 11 s rest.

A similar change in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was noted, however, when body weight gain was prevented by feeding rats diets that were calorically reduced. Therefore, it is likely that the ability of 3 to 4 months of exercise training to prevent the decrease in insulin-stimulated uptake noted as rats grow from 12 to 16 months of age occurred primarily by control of body weight. Similar results have been described by Richard and LeBlanc (1980) in younger rats engaged in swimming exercise for 8 to 12 weeks. These workers reported a reduction in body weight gain and improvement in insulin sensitivity with swimming exercise similar to that observed in sedentary rats in whom weight gain was reduced by pair feeding. Furthermore, studies on humans engaged in low intensity exercise also have shown limited or negligible effects on improving insulin sensitivity over that exhibited by weight reduction alone (Bjorntorp et al., 1973; Buskirk et al., 1963; Ruderman et al. 1979; Saltin et al., 1979) . On the other hand, it should not be concluded that exercise-training cannot enhance insulin sensitivity other than through an effect on body weight. For example, when exercise-training is maintained at high levels in humans or young rats, insulin sensitivity is enhanced over levels attained in weight-matched nonexercising subjects (Berger et al., 1979; Bjorntorp et al., 1972; Lohmann et al., 1978; Mondon et al., 1980) . Thus, the current results provide some information as to the level of exercise-training required to improve insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In these studies, rats were trained to run at a level comparable to that observed in similar aged rats who had been running spontaneously since they were 2 months old. This level of physical activity is relatively low, however, compared with that attained by young rats (Mondon et al., 1985) , and a more intensive training program would likely have enhanced insulin action above and beyond its ability to prevent weight gain. For example, we have recently published data on men above the age of 65 who engaged in vigorous physical exercise at least three times per week (Hollenbeck et al., 1985) . When these individuals were compared with an age-matched group of individuals who were in equally good general health, but not in training, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was significantly greater in the group of older men actively training. Thus, it is clear that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake can increase in older individuals provided the training program is sufficiently rigorous.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 616, "end": 642, "text": "Richard and LeBlanc (1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1130, "text": "(Bjorntorp et al., 1973;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1152, "text": "Buskirk et al., 1963;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1174, "text": "Ruderman et al. 1979;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1195, "text": "Saltin et al., 1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1552, "text": "(Berger et al., 1979;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1576, "text": "Bjorntorp et al., 1972;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1577, "end": 1598, "text": "Lohmann et al., 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1619, "text": "Mondon et al., 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2035, "end": 2056, "text": "(Mondon et al., 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2336, "end": 2361, "text": "(Hollenbeck et al., 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, it appears that exercise-training can enhance insulin-induced glucose uptake in two ways.

In addition, exercise-training can increase insulin-stimulated glucose uptake independent of weight loss, possibly by eliciting specific changes in glycogen content and/or muscle enzyme activity (Conlee et al., 1978; Piehl et al., 1974) .

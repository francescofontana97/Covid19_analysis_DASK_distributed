An observational study was performed to determine how rapidly conventional treatment improves airway inflammation in patients admitted to hospital with AECOPD. Methods: Twenty-four consecutive patients with AECOPD were recruited and changes in sputum inflammatory indices were assessed after 2 and 4 days of treatment. The primary end-points included presence of bacteria and viruses, changes in sputum total cell counts (TCC) and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) differential counts, and levels of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), IL-8 and TNF-a. Results: All patients received oral corticosteroids and 17 (71%) were also treated with oral antibiotics. A bacterial or viral pathogen was isolated from 12 patients (50%), and Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from one. A positive bacterial culture was associated with increased sputum TCC and PMN count (P < 0.05), as well as higher levels of IL-8 and TNF-a (P < 0.05), and a trend towards lower sputum SLPI levels (P = 0.06). Sputum PMN numbers fell by 70% within the first 48 h of admission (P < 0.05), accompanied by an increase in sputum SLPI (P < 0.001) and reductions in the levels of TNF-a (P < 0.005) and IL-8 (P = 0.06), with no further significant change at 4 days.

This was accompanied by a highly significant improvement in airway anti-protease defences, as indicated by the increase in SLPI levels. There was little further improvement in these sputum inflammatory indices after 48 h. The rapid decrease in sputum neutrophils may suggest a direct effect of CS, perhaps mediated by downregulation of chemokines, such as IL-8 and inhibition of PMN-related adhesion molecule expression on pulmonary blood vessels. 25, 26 Arguing against the first of these explanations was the poor relationship between changes in sputum IL-8 and PMN numbers. However, there was a positive relationship between changes in sputum PMN numbers and TNF-a levels. Airway epithelial cells produce TNF-a in response to a variety of stimuli, including bacterial infection. 27 The expression of key neutrophil-related adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and E-selectin on vascular endothelial cells is upregulated by TNF-a, and potential inhibition by CS of TNF-a production may be one of the ways in which neutrophils are cleared from the airway during the acute phase of AECOPD, but this needs further study. [28] [29] [30] [31] Sputum SLPI concentrations on admission were lower than those in stable COPD patients, although it should be noted that these individuals had milder disease, and also compared with the levels in normal control subjects. This was particularly so in current smokers experiencing an AECOPD, suggesting that the expected upregulation of airway anti-protease defences in response to acute inflammation was either deficient or that consumption by the products of neutrophil activation exceeded the capacity of the airways to compensate. The inverse relationship between SLPI and sputum neutrophils on admission would support the latter explanation. However, the increase in sputum SLPI levels over 48 h was not directly related to the accompanying reduction in sputum neutrophil numbers. One explanation for this may be that CS therapy directly upregulates SLPI production by airway epithelial cells, as has been demonstrated in vitro in epithelial cell cultures. 32 In this study almost all patients reported significantly fewer symptoms after 48 h, especially in terms of general well-being, but changes in airway inflammation and symptoms were not paralleled by improvements in FEV1. The current study suggests monitoring FEV1 as a measure of short-term clinical improvement during AECOPD is not useful. Indeed, on reviewing the decision-making process for discharge of these patients, it was quite evident that lung function was not a factor-as it would be, for example, in acute asthma.

There are suggestions that the key determinant of the local host immune response in the airways of COPD patients who are chronically colonized with bacteria, is the burden of infection, that is, the bacterial load. 7, 8, 33, 34 Whether expression of bacterial virulence factors is also important, especially at the time of an AECOPD, requires further investigation. 35 Ideally, patients should also have been assessed before they were treated with CS or antibiotics; however, the vast majority of patients in this study had received both these treatments before admission.

These observations raise questions regarding the need for the prolonged courses of systemic CS that are currently recommended; from the present data there seems to be little evidence to support the continuation of CS therapy beyond 2 days. The evidence base for more aggressive CS therapy is not strong and short courses would minimize the potential adverse effects of CS in this generally elderly and frail population. 36 Whether inflammation would recur with such short treatment courses needs to be studied prospectively. 36, 37 Patients with even a hint of clinical asthma were carefully excluded from this study. Sputum eosinophils were present in small numbers, overall, and remained unchanged with treatment. These findings suggest that eosinophils do not play a role in usual AECOPD, although it is possible that prior CS therapy, even if only for 48 h, may have modulated eosinophilic inflammation before the patients who had received such therapy presented at hospital (n = 11, 46%).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 704, "end": 706, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 809, "end": 812, "text": "36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 813, "end": 815, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, the findings from this study demonstrated that viral and bacterial pathogens were frequently associated with AECOPD and that bacterial pathogens were associated with more florid airway inflammation and increased depletion of airway antiprotease defences.

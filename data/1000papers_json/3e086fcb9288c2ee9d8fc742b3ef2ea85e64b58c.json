Dissociation of the core by chaotropic agents leads to the release of a helical nucleoprotein composed of the genomic RNA and the N protein. All M protein molecules are embedded within the membrane. TGEV M protein presents two topologies. In one-third of the molecules both the amino and the carboxy terminus face the outside of the virion, whereas in the other two-thirds the carboxy terminus is inside and is integrated within the core, being essential to maintain its structure (Escors et al. 2001a, b) . In addition, the virus envelope contains two other proteins, S and E (Enjuanes et al. 2000a ). The S protein is responsible for attachment and entry into cells and is the major inducer of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies ).",

The genes are arranged in the order 5 0 -Rep1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3 0 . TGEV mRNAs consist of seven to eight types of varying sizes, depending on the strain (Penzes et al. 2001 ). Fig. 1A , B.

Group 1 includes coronaviruses infecting human, porcine, canine, and feline species, closely related in sequence and, in some cases, also antigenically (S\u00b5nchez et al. 1990 ). Coronaviruses are associated mainly with respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and central nervous system diseases. In humans and fowl, coronaviruses primarily cause upper respiratory tract infections, whereas porcine and bovine coronaviruses establish enteric infections that result in severe economic loss (USDA 2002) . Human CoV are responsible for 10%-20% of all common colds and have been implicated in gastroenteritis, highand low-respiratory tract infections, and rare cases of encephalitis (Denison 1999) . HCoV have also been associated with infant necrotizing enterocolitis (Resta et al. 1985) and are tentative candidates for multiple sclerosis (Denison 1999) . Recently, a new SARS-CoV has emerged, infecting more than 8,000 people and causing more than 800 deaths in 5 months (Drosten et al. 2003; Holmes and Enjuanes 2003; Marra et al. 2003; Thiel et al. 2003a) .",

TGEV is an enteropathogenic coronavirus that replicates in both villous epithelial cells of the small intestine and in lung cells. A nonenteropathogenic virus related to TGEV, the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), appeared in Europe in the 1980s (Callebaut et al. 1988; Pensaert et al. 1986 ) and later on in North America (Vaughn and Paul 1993; Vaughn et al. 1995; Wesley et al. 1990b) . This virus replicates to high titers in the respiratory tract and undergoes limited replication in submucosal cells of the small intestine (Cox et al. 1990a, b) . In contrast to TGEV, PRCV infection of swine resulted no clinical signs of disease (Duret et al. 1988; Pensaert et al. 1986; Wesley et al. 1990b) .",

The RNA was expressed in a process mediated by the recognition of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter by the cellular polymerase II. This process was followed by a second amplification in the cytoplasm driven by the viral polymerase and (3) increase of viral cDNA stability within bacteria by cloning the cDNA as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) producing a maximum of two plasmid copies per cell. Following this procedure, an infectious TGEV cDNA clone that produces a virulent virus infecting both the enteric and the respiratory tract of swine was engineered (Almaz\u00b5n et al. 2000) . The stable propagation of a TGEV full-length cDNA in bacteria as a BAC has been improved by the insertion of an intron to disrupt the toxic region identified in the viral genome ( Fig. 3 ) (Gonz\u00b5lez et al. 2002) . The viral RNA was transcribed in the cell nucleus under the control of the CMV promoter, and the intron was efficiently removed during translocation of this RNA to the cytoplasm. Intron insertion in two different positions allowed stable plasmid amplification for at least 200 generations. Infectious TGEV was efficiently recovered from cells transfected with the modified cDNAs. The great advantage of this system is that coronavirus reverse genetics only involves standard recombinant DNA technologies performed within bacteria. The experience in our laboratory over more than 5 years has proven that this approach leads to the efficient rescue of mutants in all viral genes.",

Recombinant vaccinia viruses containing the HCoV-229E genome are recovered after transfection of the vaccinia virus DNA into cells infected with fowlpox virus. In a second phase, the vaccinia virus DNA is purified and used as a template for in vitro transcription of HCoV-229E genomic RNA, which is transfected into susceptible cells for the recovery of infectious recombinant coronavirus. An IBV cDNA clone was assembled using the same strategy reported for HCoV-229E with some modifications. Similarly to HCoV-229E, the IBV genomic cDNA is assembled down- stream of the T7 promoter by in vitro ligation and cloned into the vaccinia virus DNA.

A comparative analysis of replicative polyproteins of coronaviruses and arteriviruses identified the most variable regions in the N-terminal half of pp1a (Bonilla et al. 1994; Lee et al. 1991; Nelsen et al. 1999) . Further insight into the Coronaviridae family showed some conserved domains in the pp1a/pp1b polyproteins between coronaviruses and toroviruses. The observation that some domains are not conserved in all coronaviruses and toroviruses indicated that these might be nonessential for the viral life cycle. In addition, all conserved arterivirus domains were found to be smaller than their coronavirus counterparts, indicating that some sequences in the coronavirus genome could be dispensable for virus replicative functions (Gorbalenya 2001) . Nevertheless, attempts to delete the replicase nonconserved domains to determine whether they are essential have not yet been made.",

Although in the enteric and virulent Miller strain of TGEV expression of mRNAs from ORFs 3a and 3b has been observed, another virulent TGEV isolate (McGoldrick et al. 1999 ) includes a large deletion in ORF 3a, suggesting that this ORF is not required for replication in the enteric tract or to lead to virulent isolates. In other attenuated TGEV strains with a growth essentially limited to the respiratory tract, including the Purdue strain, the subgenomic mRNA corresponding to ORF 3b is not transcribed because this gene is preceded by a noncanonical transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) (OConnor and Brian 1999 Brian , 2000 Wesley et al. 1989 ). These PRCV variants have deletions of varying sizes within ORF 3a and 3b (Vaughn et al. 1995; Wesley et al. 1991) . The lack of enteric tropism and attenuation of these TGEV strains has been associated with a deletion of around 670 nt located at the 5 0 end of the S gene and not with deletion of genes 3a and 3b (S\u00b5nchez et al. 1992 (S\u00b5nchez et al. , 1999 .",

TGEV ORF 7 is located downstream of the essential N gene. With the TGEV infectious cDNA clone including unique engineered restriction endonuclease sites, a deletion mutant was generated (rTGEV-D7) in which gene 7 expression has been abrogated (Ortego et al. 2003) . The rTGEV-D7 contained a deletion spanning 21 nt upstream of the ORF 7 AUG and the first nucleotides of this ORF. Recombinant rTGEV-D7 showed standard kinetics in cell culture, indicating that the protein encoded by gene 7 was not essential for TGEV replication in tissue culture (Ortego et al. 2003; Sola et al. 2003) .

Coronavirus mRNAs have a leader sequence at their 5 0 ends. Preceding every transcription unit on the viral genomic RNA, there is a conserved core sequence (CS) that is identical to a sequence located at the 3 0 end of the leader sequence (CS-L). This sequence motif constitutes part of the signal for subgenomic mRNA transcription.

Essential genes required for TGEV replication. The diagram shows a scheme of the TGEV genome in which the partial overlapping between genes has been resolved by duplicating sequences at the 5 0 end of each gene, starting at gene S, in order to be able to delete a gene without affecting the expression of the flanking ones. The duplicated sequences include termination codons of the preceding gene and TRSs including the CS (5 0 -CUAAAC-3 0 ). In addition, the indicated unique restriction endonuclease sites (top of the bars) were introduced to create insertion sites for heterologous genes. The name of the gene is indicated on top of each bar contiguous sequences. The mechanism involved in this process is under debate; nevertheless, the discontinuous transcription during negativestrand RNA synthesis model is compatible with most of the experimental evidence (Pasternak et al. 2001; Sawicki et al. 2001; van Marle et al. 1999; Zfflaeiga et al. 2004 ) (see chapter by Sawicki and Sawicki, this volume) .

Although several studies on the effect of the extension of this complementarity on mRNA synthesis have been performed (Alonso et al. 2002a; Joo and Makino 1992; La Monica et al. 1992; Makino and Joo 1993; Makino et al. 1991; Shieh et al. 1987; van der Most et al. 1994 ) the length of optimum TRSs has not been accurately defined. (2) Proximity of a gene to the 3 0 end. Because the TRSs are considered slow down or stop signals for the replicase complex, the smaller mRNAs should be the most abundant. Although this has been shown to be the case in the Mononegavirales (Wertz et al. 1998) , and in coronaviruses shorter mRNAs are generally more abundant, the relative abundance of coronavirus mRNAs is not strictly related to their proximity to the 3 0 end (Alonso et al. 2002a; Penzes et al. 2001) . (3) Potential interaction of proteins with the TRS RNA and protein-protein interactions that could regulate transcription levels.

In the RNA-protein interaction, primary or secondary RNA structure of sequences flanking the CS are probably involved. Therefore, identification of the nature and size of these sequences should help to understand the transcription mechanism. In TGEV, the TRSs have been characterized with a helper-dependent expression system based on coronavirus minigenomes, by studying the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgmRNAs). TGEV TRSs include the CS (5 0 -CUAAAC-3 0 ), which promotes from 100-to 1,000-fold increase of mRNA synthesis when this CS is located in the appropriate context (i.e., flanked by the appropriate 5 0 and 3 0 sequences) (Alonso et al. 2002a ). The relevant sequences contributing to TRS activity have been studied by extending the CS 5 0 upstream and 3 0 downstream. Sequences from virus genes flanking the CS influenced transcription levels from moderate (10-to 20-fold variation) to complete mRNA synthesis silencing. For example, a canonical CS at nt 120 downstream of the initiation codon of the S gene did not lead to production of the corresponding mRNA because of the nature of the flanking sequences (Alonso et al. 2002a ). The effect of 5 0 flanking sequences on transcription has also been studied using full-length genomes by inserting between genes N and 7 an expression cassette identical to those studied in the minigenome. The highest ratio of mRNA to genomic RNA was reached with 5 0 TRSs of about 88 nt, in agreement with the results obtained with the minigenomes and confirming the importance of sequences flanking the CS 5 0 end (Alonso et al. 2002a) .",

In seven constructs the CS was flanked at the 3 0 end by each of the sequences flanking the CS in the virus genes S, 3a, 3b, E, M, N, and 7. In addition, another construct was designed to extend in 12 nucleotides the potential base-pairing between the 3 0 end of the leader and cTRS.

(2) These viruses have the largest RNA virus genome and, in principle, have room for the insertion of large foreign genes (Enjuanes et al. 2000a; Masters 1999) . (3) A pleiotropic secretory immune response is best induced by the stimulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Because coronaviruses in general infect mucosal surfaces, both respiratory and enteric, they may be used to target the antigen to the enteric and respiratory areas to induce a strong secretory immune response. (4) The tropism of coronaviruses may be engineered by modifying the S gene (Ballesteros et al. 1997; Kuo et al. 2000; Leparc-Goffart et al. 1998; S\u00b5nchez et al. 1999 ).

GUS and a surface glycoprotein (ORF5) that is the major protective antigen of the porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRSSV) have been expressed using this vector (Alonso et al. 2002b) . GUS expression levels with an optimized TRS ranged between 2 and 8 mg of protein per 10 6 cells. Protein levels were dependent on the extent of transcription and also on translation regulation because the presence of an appropriate Kozak context led to higher protein expression levels (Alonso et al. 2002a ).

Expression of CAT or HE was detected only in the first two passages because the minigenome used lacks the packaging signal (Liao and Lai 1995) . When virus vectors expressing CAT and HE were inoculated intracerebrally into mice, HEor CAT-specific subgenomic mRNAs were only detected in the brains at days 1 and 2, indicating that the genes in the DI vector were expressed only in the early stage of viral infection (Zhang et al. 1998 ). An MHV DI RNA was also developed as a vector for expressing IFN-g. The murine IFN-g was secreted into culture medium as early as 6 h after transfection and reached a peak level at 12 h. No inhibition of virus replication was detected with the IFN-g produced by the DI RNA in cell cultures, but infection of susceptible mice with DI RNA producing IFN-g caused significantly milder disease, accompanied by less virus replication than that caused by virus containing a control DI vector .",

The mRNA levels were high in the two insertion sites closer to the 3 0 end of the minigenome and slightly increased in the most 3 0 site. In contrast, in a minigenome derived from the HCoV-229E, an expression cassette was cloned into three different positions (at 1.1, 1.3, and 1.8 kb from the 5 0 end of a minigenome of about 2.1 kb) and the mRNA levels decreased for inserts located closer to the 3 0 end (Thiel et al. 1998) . The experiments performed with TGEV and HCoV-229E apparently led to different results. With TGEV, and possibly with HCoV-229, some insertion sites were too close to the ends of the minigenomes and may have affected essential primary or secondary structures required for their replication. It is possible that in coronavirus the variation of expression levels with insertion site is mainly influenced by the sequences flanking the TRS in each position and that the relative position itself plays a less prominent role. In fact, in a systematic study using MHV, a 0.4-kb region including a TRS of 12 nt flanked upstream and downstream by 0.2-kb fragments was inserted at seven different positions of a 2.2-kb minigenome (Jeong et al. 1996) . The 12-nt TRS core was flanked by upstream and downstream sequences in order to prevent the influence of variable flanking sequences within the different insertion sites. In all insertion sites, the level both of the minigenome and of the mRNA produced were similar, suggesting that the position of the insert along the minigenome had little influence on the mRNA expression level.",

            "text": "In full-length genomes, a correlation between the proximity to the 3 0 end of the genome and the relative efficiency of mRNA synthesis from a given TRS has been observed in several viral systems, including coronaviruses such as MHV and TGEV (Alonso et al. 2002a; de Haan et al. 2003; Hiscox et al. 1995; Sola et al. 2003; van Marle et al. 1995) , arteriviruses such as EAV (Pasternak et al. 2003) , and the Mononegavirales (Iverson and Rose 1981; Wertz et al. 1998 ). In the TGEV single genome vector, in order to increase heterologous gene expression levels, an expression cassette encoding the GFP gene was inserted at the 3 0 end of the genome. Insertion of the expression cassette between TGEV genes N and 7 resulted in an unstable virus, leading to the complete deletion of the additional transcriptional unit. In contrast, insertion of similar expression cassettes replacing ORFs 3a and 3b led to stable expression of GFP . Therefore, the location of the insertion, and not the nature of the gene, was most likely responsible for the instability. The origin of TGEV recombinant virus instability was mediated either by homologous recombination promoted by the presence of duplicated viral sequences or by nonhomologous recombination yielding a virus that had lost the GFP gene and also the 5 0 end of gene 7. Therefore, in addition to similarity-essential recombination, similarity-nonessential recombination (Nagy and Simon 1997) may also lead to the instability of these viruses. The instability of expression cassettes inserted at the 3 0 end of the genome seems a general phenomenon because, in addition, it has been shown that several expression modules encoding the GUS gene were also unstable at this position of the genome but not at the ORF 3a site . Furthermore, insertion of other sequence fragments (i.e., 3 0 end 141 nt of N gene or 717 nt of GFP) between the N gene and the 3 0 UTR of MHV also produced genomic instability (Hsue and Masters 1999) .",

Because the TRS is also located at the 5 0 end of each gene, the insertion of duplicated sequences and of restriction endonuclease sites could alter virus pathogenicity. In fact, with the use of TGEV it has been shown that the introduction of one restriction endonuclease site between each pair of adjacent genes leads to a decrease in enteric tract virus growth and virulence by more than 10-fold and 5-fold, respectively (Ortego et al. 2003) .

Although deletion of these genes reduced TGEV virulence very little , FIPV was clearly attenuated (Haijema et al. 2003) . In contrast, deletion of the nonessential gene 7 attenuated both TGEV and FIPV. Therefore, modification of certain nonessential genes may be used as an efficient approach to reduce the virulence of coronavirus vectors.",

Coronavirus vectors based on the TGEV genome have been engineered to infect human cells by replacing the porcine coronavirus S gene with that of human coronaviruses . To increase the safety of the human-adapted vector, a replicationcompetent, propagation-deficient virus, in which two essential genes (E and N) were deleted, is being modified by introducing mutations that abrogate the activity of the RNA packaging signal (Y) and relocating an active Y between the two deleted genes (Escors et al. 2003) . A recombination event leading to the recovery of the essential genes will most likely lead to loss of the packaging signal, generating a nonviable virus.",

The sequences that regulate transcription have been characterized with helperdependent expression systems and full-length infectious cDNA clones. Minigenome-based expression systems have the advantage of their large cloning capacity, in principle higher than 27 kb, produce reasonable amounts of heterologous antigens (2-8 mg/10 6 cells), show a limited stability (synthesis of heterologous gene is maintained for around 10 passages), and elicit strong immune responses. In contrast, coronavirus vectors based on single genomes have at present a limited cloning capacity (around 5 kb) and expression levels of heterologous genes are 10-fold higher than those of helper-dependent systems (>50 mg/10 6 cells) and are very stable (>30 passages). The possibility of expressing different genes under the control of TRSs with programmable strength and engineering tissue and species tropism indicates that coronavirus vectors are very flexible. High expression levels have been obtained with replication-competent, propagation-deficient vectors based on coronavirus genomes. Thus coronavirus-based vectors are emerging with high potential for vaccine development and, possibly, for gene therapy.",

Within our sample of over 6,000 adults aged 18 to 59, we found that there was a very large decrease in employment. The fraction of the sample that was conventionally classified as employed decreased from 57% in February to 48% in April. If we further exclude temporarily absent workers, which we term \"furloughed\" employees, this fraction decreases further to 38%. Thus, about one out of every three employed people in our sample either lost their job or did not work and received no wages during April. This has extremely large implications for poverty and welfare. We further analyse the labour market by comparing across demographic groups as defined by race, by gender, by age groups, by geographic areas and by education levels. The overarching finding from this analysis is that the job losses were not uniformly distributed amongst the different groups. In particular, groups who have always been more vulnerable -such as women, African/Blacks, youth and less educated groups -have been disproportionately negatively affected.",

To date, there are several pieces of anecdotal evidence that the labour market has been severely affected, but the magnitude of these effects remain unknown. This is primarily due to the lack of quantitative data that reflects dynamics in the labour market in the period during which the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown came into effect. In this paper, we summarise the employment rates for various demographic groups, as measured in Wave 1 of the newly released NIDS-CRAM study (2020). We then explore the wage distribution, hours worked distribution and rates of job loss amongst these groups. The overall objective it to generate a picture of what is happening in the labour market in South Africa, as reflected in the NIDS-CRAM Wave 1 sample.",

Finding a formal sector job is strongly correlated with exiting from poverty and losing one has a big impact on falling back into poverty. Thus, vulnerability to job loss is itself an important aspect of a household's general well-being. In addition, South Africa is widely considered to be one of the most unequal countries in the world and the primary driver of economic inequality is also mediated through access to formal sector employment. Thus, understanding the dynamics in the labour market are key to understanding how South Africa as a society is adapting and evolving in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown.",

South Africa entered the \"hard lockdown\" in late March, for an initial period of 3 weeks which was then extended to 5 weeks. During this time, the state introduced the concept of \"lockdown stages,\" with the original \"hard lockdown\" effectively being Stage 5 while the pre-lockdown phase from early March was effectively Stage 0. Since then the country has varied the stage of lockdown in effect and is currently 1 at Stage 3. There is no clear timeline for when we might return to Stage 0.",

What is clear is that the NIDS-CRAM study contains a significantly greater proportion of employed people than the most recent QLFS. The QLFS is run by the national statistics office, StatsSA, in order to provide national statistics on employment rates and trends. It has a sample of over 60 000 respondents per wave and is conducted four times per annum. The sample is also periodically re-drawn in order to ensure that it remains nationally representative. Thus, the QLFS data up to the first quarter of 2020 is probably a better source of information if one wanted to obtain an overall profile of the South African labour market. This implies that one needs to be cautious about generalising research findings from NIDS-CRAM to the country at large. Nonetheless, there are at least two attributes on the NIDS-CRAM data that make it invaluable for understanding the current moment. First, the NIDS-CRAM study is designed as a longitudinal study and has a large sample that can yield a great deal of understanding about what is happening to the people in the sample. Internal validity and comparisons over time for the sample is not an issue of concern. Second, at present there is no comparable or alternative data set that can be used to understand contemporary labour market dynamics in South Africa. This further enhances the value of NIDS-CRAM. In addition, some of the operational challenges that NIDS-CRAM experienced during this period will almost surely also be experienced by any other survey group and at present there is no information about when the QLFS2020:2 will be released.",

This drops in April -using the conventional definition -to 45.3%, a decrease of 8.9 percentage points.

Here, we see that some people from all earnings groups lost their employment between February and April, but there is a very clear and steep gradient in the likelihood of a job loss depending on one's prior earnings level. Thus, the fraction of low wage earners, i.e. those who earned below R3000 per month; who lost their jobs between February and April, was 38%, or approximately two out of five. For those in the two middle-earning groups, i.e. R3000-R6000 and R6000-R12000, this number was still high at approximately 18.5%. In contrast, the higher earnings groups experienced relatively low levels of job loss, as just over 5%. What this implies is that the wage distribution in Table 5 is not changing primarily because of wage increases. Instead, the observed change in the wage distribution is being driven primarily due to a compositional change driven by the much greater likelihood of transitioning out of employment for low wage workers relative to high wage workers.",

However, once we account for the effect of furloughed workers, these numbers change dramatically. A 7% of adults who were not employed in February subsequently found employment, 11 while 39% of those with a job in February were either permanently or temporarily laid off by April. This general pattern, i.e. that explicitly accounting for temporary layoffs matters a great deal for our understanding of the labour market, is abundantly clear in the table.

Whites are more than twice as likely to find employment when compared to any of the other race groups and less than half as likely to have lost employment when compared to the other race groups combined. Respondents based in urban areas were less likely to find employment, and also less likely to lose employment, relative to people in non-urban areas. The youth face an even more challenging task in the current labour market, where they are extremely unlikely to find employment (6.1%), while they are also greatly at risk of losing employment (43%). Finally, we observe that a tertiary education has afforded people a relative degree of protection in the labour market. Job finding rates are relatively low amongst all groups, but there is a very large difference in the likelihood of losing a job for people with some form of a tertiary education (28.7%), compared to those with only a matric level education (42.8%) or those with less than a matric level education (45.5%).",

Hence, health authorities cannot totally rely on confirmed 90 cases of COVID-19 detected by RT-PCR as it could potentially miss asymptomatic and pre-91 symptomatic infections for containment measures. In order to overcome this challenge, WHO 92 and others have recommended population-based seroepidemiological studies to generate data 93 and to implement containment measures accordingly [7]. These surveys also can give us an 94 estimation of the proportion of the population still susceptible to the infection as it is assumed 95 that antibodies provide immunity. 96 Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has conducted a nationwide serosurvey among 97 21 states and reported a population-weighted seroprevalence of 0.73% between May and June 98 2020.[8] While a hospital-based survey from Srinagar, northern India has estimated gender-preventive health services through a Rural Health centre and network of mobile 103 clinics to residents of Bangalore rural district over a decade. CHD also runs special programs 104 for chronic diseases, disability rehabilitation and alcohol de-addiction. One of our flagship 105 programs is home-based rural palliative care program which has benefited numerous patients 106 with terminal illness ever since it was initiated in 2005. Our grass root workers continued to 107 do home visits to provide home care, monitor blood pressure and blood sugar, and to educate 108 the community about COVID-19. However, we had stopped our mobile clinics to reduce the 109 urban-rural transmission of infection. As there can be considerable variation in the 110 seroprevalence based on geographical setting and density of the population, knowledge of 111 seroprevalence in this community help us to conduct a risk-benefit analysis of certain 112 services like mobile clinics, which improves access to medical care at the cost of spreading 113 the virus to the rural community. Hence, we designed a community-based cross-sectional 114",

We could imply that the efforts to sensitise the public regarding COVID19 by the government and private sectors in sensitisation have played a valuable role.We estimated an IFR of 12.8 per 10000 infections or 0.13%, which is comparable to what is reported from the Indian subcontinent ( 0.27-1.03) and other countries like USA (0.12-0.2%) Iran (0.08-0.12%), Brazil and Spain (1%)[8,21,24]. Estimating IFR is a challenge as it will depend on infection rate (seroprevalence) and the robustness of system capturing mortality.Both variables have estimation challenges of varying degrees in different parts of India. Since there are only a handful of studies estimating seroprevalence, we have only limited studies to compare. IFR reported in a study conducted in a Bangalore slum during the same period was absurdly low (0.03%), which can be attributed to under-reporting of deaths rather than reduced fatality in urban slums [9].We could draw several implications from the findings of the study. First and foremost, rural areas succeeded in halting the spread of infection to a greater extent as compared to cities.However, rural areas are challenged by the poor health system and low cash economy, distancing itself from urbanisation reaped overall health benefits to people in villages, in terms of the number of infections. This is a reminder that guarded urbanisation preserving the natural ecosystem is an essential determinant of health.Secondly, strict containment strategies like lockdown curbed infection without profound livelihood implication sin this rural setting. This was possible because of the strength of the local economy and reduced inequities. The villages had enough seasonal grains (ragi, a millet), homegrown vegetables and dairy products for nourishment. Since the population density was less, there was enough water for the increased demand for handwashing, clean air to breathe, and physical distancing was a practical possibility. Strong social connections, a powerful rural disposition added value during COVID-19 infections. Neighbourhoods took care of infected households with food and essential medicines and arranged for a referral if they need hospital support.Thirdly, low seroprevalence should be looked in two ways. One way to look at this 322 'achievement', success in preventing the spread and the other way to look at it as 323 'responsibility' due to susceptibility. Since we assume that other villages in India have similar or a slightly lesser seroprevalence, we need to keep in mind' huge susceptible burden' as 68.84% of India's population live in villages according to the census (2011)[25]. This has potential to staggering peaks and gives a warning signal for policymakers about the possibilities of multiple waves of the pandemic. In this context, discussion on sustaining",

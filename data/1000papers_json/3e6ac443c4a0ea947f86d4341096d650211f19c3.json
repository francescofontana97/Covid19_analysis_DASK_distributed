Using data from Spain and Italy, we estimate an age dependent infection fatality ratio for SARS-CoV-2, as well as risks of hospitalization and intensive care admission. We use them in a model that simulates the dynamics of the virus using an age structured, spatially detailed agent based approach, that explicitly incorporates governamental interventions, changes in mobility and contact patterns occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak in each country. Our simulations reproduce several of the features of its spatio-temporal spread in the three countries studied. They show that containment measures combined with high density are responsible for the containment of cases within densely populated areas, and that spread to less densely populated areas occurred during the late stages of the first wave. The capability to reproduce observed features of the spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 makes this model a potential candidate for forecasting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in other settings, and we recommend its application in low and lower-middle countries which remain understudied.",

Rapidly causing a local epidemic, it spread around the world within a few months causing a major pandemic which by the start of May 2020 had resulted in over 1,000,000 cases and over 300,000 deaths worldwide. Early data from China suggested levels of transmissibility and virulence comparable to those observed in the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918-19, which caused an estimated 20-50 million deaths worldwide [1] . Despite causing mild in-fections in the majority of cases, a small but considerable fraction of infected individuals requires hospitalization and, in the most severe cases, intensive care with mechanical ventilation. Estimates of the case fatality ratio (CFR) show a dramatic variation across populations [2] , likely reflecting the diverse approaches to case detection adopted by different countries. In the absence of an effective vaccine able to fend off the infection, many countries have adopted stringent non-pharmaceutical control measures designed to reduce transmission rates by limiting the frequency of person-toperson contact. These measures are designed to limit the total mortality due to COVID-19 and to confine the epidemic to a level that does not 1 overwhelm national health systems.",

            "text": "As a novel infectious agent, many characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are still poorly understood and are the object of close scrutiny by the research community worldwide. Early estimates of the basic reproductive number in Hubei province, China, varied between 2.2 [3] and 3.11 [4] , with estimates in European countries ranging between 2.5 and 3.0 [5, 6, 7] . Measurements of the doubling time ranged between 2.9 and 7.4 days [5, 3] . The majority of infections are asymptomatic, but there is uncertainty over the proportion of asymptomatic infections, with reports ranging between 4.5% and 64% [8, 9, 10, 11] . A study conducted in the municipality of Vo' Euganeo, at the centre of the Italian outbreak, in which the whole population was tested irrespective of symptoms across two consecutive surveys found the mean proportion of asymptomatics to be between 40-45% [10] . An outbreak onboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess led to most passengers and staff tested for COVID-19, with 51% of laboratory confirmed cases being asymptomatic [12] and a subsequent modelling study estimating the asymptomatic proportion 74% (95% C.I. 70-78%) [13] . The proportion of cases which are asymptomatic is of interest because of their role in the transmission of the virus within the population. However, so far age stratified fractions of asymptomatic cases remain difficult to obtain. Evidence from several studies [10, 14] suggest that children are less likely to be affected by coronavirus, and data from most countries show that the rate of severe cases in young children is low compared to the mature population, although it is still unclear whether this reflects lower susceptibility or higher rates of asymptomatic infection among children. A detailed survey conducted by the Spanish Government [15] showed that only 1% of children below 1 year of age were infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Spain; this percentage increased with age to 2.2% for 1-4 years old children, and to higher percentages for older individuals, up to almost 7% for individuals aged 70-74. While this could reflect a lower susceptibility to the virus among young individuals, decoupling this variation from agestructured mixing effects requires a detailed mathematical analysis. Additionally, the Spanish survey showed that the number of infected individuals is substantially larger than the number of detected cases, suggesting that large numbers of undetected asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases may have driven the outbreak.",

These included stay-at-home measures, shielding of most-at-risk population, closure of schools and higher level educational institutions, teleworking, cancellation of mass gatherings, closure of shops, including recreational and food establishments [18] . The underlying idea of these interventions is to break the chain of transmission of the virus by reducing contact between individuals. In most countries, the interventions adopted resulted in a substantial reduction of the disease morbidity and mortality. The adoption of these intervention has typically been driven by intense modelling work carried out by national teams as well as the wider international research community. Analysis of big data provided by some large companies [19, 20] has been an important component of the modelling effort.",

Our aim is to have a model that could be readily used on a range of different countries, including middle and low income countries: we thus apply the model to three European countries, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, to assess its capability of properly reproducing observed data, and to obtain estimates of key parameters that are, as much as possible, country independent. We use data from the first serological survey performed in Spain [15] as well as data on Intensive Care Units (ICU) admissions and deaths in Italy [33] to infer rates of detection of cases, severe and critical admissions to hospital, as well as death rates due to SARS-CoV-2. We then use the model to estimate, for each country, an unrestricted R 0 , which is the value that the basic reproductive number would achieve in the absence of interventions. We project R 0 to a reference country, China, thus removing the influence of country specific contact matrices. We also estimate a set of age-dependent susceptibilities independently for each country, resulting in a overall set of age stratified susceptibilities which agrees in all the countries under study. Output from our simulations is capable of reproducing the spatio-temporal spread of the disease in the studied countries, with some disagreement on the spatial aspect for Spain due to specific features of human mobility in that country.",

Maps available with a 100m resolution were coarsened to 5km: this choice was mainly due to computational ef-ficiency. Each grid cell is treated as a well mixed population, whereas transmission between distinct grid elements is driven by human mobility. The model uses an agent-based description in which individuals have a set of preferred locations and an associated frequency of visit which are assigned at the start of the simulation. Each day individuals move to one of their preferred locations and participate to the local transmission dynamics. The list of preferred locations and their frequency of visit and duration of stay are built in accordance to the fluxes between grid elements predicted by an appropriate model for human mobility.",

When an individual is infected, the simulation program will dynamically generate a household by linking together unrelated individuals. Suppose an individual in age group j not previously included in any household is infected, a host household is generated on-the-fly.

A corresponding infection-fatality rate for reported cases can be estimated by dividing the IFR by the ascertainment rate.

In addition to these rates, we also estimated age-dependent susceptibilities for each of the countries discussed: the results are consistent among countries, and allow us to derive average susceptibilities to the SARS-CoV-2 virus usable as reference in future works (Table 2).

Nevertheless, our IFR reproduce reasonably well the age distribution of deaths registered in several countries. We estimated also an age-dependent susceptibility that shows a marked dependence on age. The estimated susceptibilities confirm that young individuls are less susceptible than older individuals to the virus, and they further suggest that this low susceptibility is shared by middle aged individuals (30-60 years old) that instead account for a large fraction of cases.

The latter was modelled using the radiation model, preferred to the gravity model due to the need of aggregating fluxes between grid elements up to the level of counties. For Italy and the United Kingdom, the radiation model achieves a CPC of about 0.45 which, considering the use of an aggregation process from base areal units, is in line with the performance of both the radiation and gravity model. However, the limitations of the radiation model are evident in the description of mobility in Spain that only scores a CPC of 0.21. Possibly, the use of more recent models for human mobility might mitigate such discrepancies [30] .",

One possibility could be to estimate the impact of future interventions in the countries studied in this work or other European countries, provided age-stratified information on cases and deaths from COVID-19 as well as information on the mobility of individuals are available for such countries. Another possibility could be its use in Low and Middle income countries: the key ingredients that would permit this are the availability of contact matrices from the work of Prem et al. [22] for almost all countries worldwide, the assumption that age-dependent susceptibility does not depend on anything other than age, and similarly the assumption that the IFR of COVID-19 derived from the Spanish data could be exported to other countries. Under these conditions the model could be used to explore the spread of COVID-19 in African and South American countries. Data on human mobility should also be available to permit studies of spatial spread, but since this is often not readily available in these contexts, with a bit of effort one could use spatially detailed time series of detected cases to infer the level of human travel by fitting an appropriate model for mobility.",

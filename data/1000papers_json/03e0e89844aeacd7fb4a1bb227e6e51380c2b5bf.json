Repeated assessments that were compared with pre-COVID-19 baseline levels included anxiety symptoms (7item Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7]), depressive symptoms (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-8]), diabetes distress (Problem Areas in Diabetes scale [PAID]), physical activity/sedentary behaviour, alcohol consumption and diabetes self-management behaviours.

During the initial 'wave' of cases in Australia in 2020, these restrictions were characterised by prohibitions on leaving home aside from four key reasons: medical care/caregiving, shopping for necessary food/supplies, essential work/education and exercise. The nature and severity of these restrictions were similar to those adopted in many countries and which remain in place in numerous locations with existent high COVID-19 caseloads. 1 Notwithstanding the importance of restrictions for containment of the pandemic, concerns remain over potential adverse psychosocial effects related to disrupted activities of daily living, social isolation, financial loss and other unintended consequences. 2, 3 Such impacts may be exacerbated in people with diabetes due to greater fear of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 4, 5 and greater reliance on access to healthcare services. 6, 7 Although healthcare was a permitted reason to travel, face-to-face clinical services across Australia were scaled back and/or replaced with telehealth. 8 A limited number of cross-sectional surveys conducted in people with type 2 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic have identified high levels of stress and social isolation, high levels of worry associated with COVID-19 infection, reduced ability to self-manage diabetes, and lack of access to medications, equipment and care. 9, 10 However, data from established cohorts with a pre-pandemic baseline and a follow-up conducted in the context of the pandemic are scarce. collaboration between Diabetes Victoria and Deakin University. Funding sources for this study had no role in study design, data collection, analysis or interpretation of data, nor in the reporting or publication of results. COVID-19-specific worry, quality of life (QoL), and healthcare appointment changes (telehealth engagement and appointment cancellations/avoidance). Results: Among 470 respondents (96%; aged 66 \u00b1 9 years, 69% men), at least 'moderate' worry about COVID-19 infection was reported by 31%, and 29%-73% reported negative impacts on QoL dimensions (greatest for: leisure activities, feelings about the future, emotional well-being). Younger participants reported more negative impacts (p < 0.05). Overall, anxiety/depressive symptoms were similar at follow-up compared with pre-COVID-19, but diabetes distress reduced (p < 0.001).",

Changes in psychosocial metrics and behavioural risk factors relative to pre-COVID-19 levels were assessed using a class of multilevel regression models that account for the within-individual correlation of the longitudinal measurements and the distributional shape of the outcome variables. These models include the multilevel generalised gamma model for skewed continuous variables (e.g., sitting time), multilevel binomial or negative binomial model for count data (left or right skewed, respectively, e.g., minutes spent walking, relevant psychosocial questionnaire factors), and multilevel logistic regression models for binary outcomes (e.g., medicationtaking). These models enable comparisons of two time-points (pre-COVID-19 vs. COVID-19 follow-up), akin to a paired t test, while accounting for the non-normal distribution of the outcome variables. Potential differences in pre-COVID-19 versus COVID-19 change between subgroups were assessed by adding relevant interaction terms with time to these models. Only interactions between time and the following variables were assessed: age, sex, cardiovascular disease (CVD) history, treatment with insulin, presence of COVID-19-specific worry, and negative impact on the 'emotional well-being' dimension of quality of life (vs. neutral/positive impact). To account for multiple hypothesis testing, we adjusted p values for main and interaction terms using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, 21 which controls for overall false discovery rates. p values were corrected within each of two major groupings of outcome measures, i.e., psychosocial and behavioural. All main effects (i.e., overall change; pre-COVID-19 vs. COVID-19 follow-up) and interaction effects (i.e., pre-COVID-19 vs. COVID-19 change according to subgroup factors) were included in false discovery rate corrections.

However, overall we found no evidence of an escalation in anxiety or depressive symptoms compared with pre-COVID-19 levels. Beyond psychosocial health, physical activity and sedentary behaviour showed modest changes, and self-care behaviours remained unchanged. Conversely, appointment cancellations and avoidance of new healthcare bookings were common, which may increase risks of future adverse health outcomes. The absence of increasing anxiety and depressive symptoms in the total cohort may provide some reassurance about the mental health impacts of lockdowns in adults with type 2 diabetes, even if generalisability to longer duration or repeated lockdowns remains uncertain. This somewhat surprising finding may reflect that data were collected during Australia's first wave-a period of low incidence of infections/deaths relative to other countries and during which restrictions tended to be easing (cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in Australia at the mid-point of our follow-up was 28 per 100,000; cumulative testing rate: 3983 per 100,000 22 ). Nevertheless, composite markers of lockdown severity-e.g., the COVID-19 Government Stringency Index (0-100 scale based on nine indicators including stay-at-home restrictions, workplace/school closures, etc. [100 = most strict])-suggest that Australia's restrictions at that time (60-70 range) were akin to many other countries, and indeed, similar to those that remain in the United States and many European and Asian countries in early 2021. 1 Thus, our data are likely generalisable to other comparable countries in terms of lockdown severity. Also noteworthy is that substantial measures to support people with diabetes were put in place by both governmental and non-governmental agencies in Australia, so our findings may in part attest to their effectiveness (though we did not test this). 8",

The prevalence of diabetes distress in our cohort was low at baseline (15% vs. 36% in an international systematic review), 23 and we then observed a significant reduction at follow-up. One hypothesis for this phenomenon, consistent with conservation of resources, is that COVID-19 concerns displaced diabetes distress. Alternatively, lifestyle changes associated with the restrictions (e.g., working from home, limited social dining) may have had unintended benefits for coping with the demands of living with diabetes.",

While the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms was relatively low at baseline and remained broadly unchanged, more adverse trajectories were observed in those who reported worry about infection or a negative impact on the 'emotional well-being' dimension of quality of life. Even so, within these subgroups reporting worry and/or emotional well-being impact, anxiety/depressive symptoms did not increase to moderate/severe levels, reinforcing that inferences about change over time should not be made from one-off COVID-19-specific measures. Although our findings would appear to contradict the increasing mental distress compared with pre-COVID-19 levels observed in the general UK population, 24 such trends appear to be driven primarily by changes in younger people and in women. We observed a similar trend for age, but not for gender. The older age of many people with type 2 diabetes limits the proportion who were exposed to the stresses of home-schooling and loss of employment.",

An increase in fitness-oriented walking-which may be attributed to exercise being designated one of the four permissible reasons to leave home during lockdown-appeared to largely offset reductions in incidental walking and vigorous/strength training. The prospect of a link between the relative maintenance of both physical activity and anxiety/depression symptoms should not be underestimated, with cross-sectional studies already reporting this in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. 26 There were no changes in overall rates of medication-taking and glucose self-monitoring, while diabetes-specific self-efficacy and social support remained stable. In contrast to anxiety/depressive symptoms, COVID-19-specific worry did not appear to modify self-care factors.

Beyond the demographic characteristics of the catchment area around the study site (i.e., relatively high socio-economic status), reasons for these biases are unclear. Regardless, they may obviously limit generalisability to the broader type 2 diabetes population, who may be more vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19. Baseline glycated haemoglobin and other risk factor data also attest to a cohort with relatively well-managed type 2 diabetes, though it is unclear whether these markers changed in the context of the pandemic. As previously noted, our findings also need to be considered in the context of the timing of data collection, i.e., during Australia's 'first wave', with lockdown restrictions still in place, but relatively low incidence of COVID-19 cases/deaths. It is unclear the extent to which the current results can be generalised to repeated or longer lockdowns in Australia or other countries. The lack of a group without diabetes also precluded direct determination of whether changes in people with type 2 diabetes diverged from the general population or people with other chronic diseases. Finally, our reliance on questionnaires and telephone interviews gives rise to the possibility of self-report biases.",

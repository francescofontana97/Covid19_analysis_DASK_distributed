Without a unified framework, it is difficult to aggregate the data from different states, gain insights from them, and coordinate an effective nationwide response to the pandemic.

However, Bihar seems to release some data on Twitter. See Appendix H for more details on that. We did not consider data reported on social media for multiple reasons. First, there are multiple social media platforms. Expecting people to be on the right platform and following the right person to obtain relevant public health information is unreasonable. Second, relevant information can easily get lost amid several posts. Third, obtaining historical data by scrolling through the feed is practically impossible.

First, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) licensure for the CRU was obtained under the Authorization and Guidelines for Use of Alternate Space for Treatment of Patients During the COVID19 2020 State of Emergency 10 issued by the DPH pursuant to the Commonwealth's Emergency Declaration. This allowed the hospital to perform clinical care in unlicensed space not owned by BMC. Second, the CRU was classi ed as a medicalized shelter by DPH, and as a \"bedded outpatient\" unit by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), avoiding the need to qualify for inpatient level of care and allowing for medications to be prescribed on an outpatient basis. This, in turn, allowed the CRU to operate without an inpatient pharmacy. Third, anticipation of emergency state and federal funding allowed for simpli ed processes and documentation since billing was not required.

When testing occurred, large groups of patients were suddenly identi ed who needed admission for isolation and quarantine 4 . A second challenge was the tremendous variability in the prevalence of COVID-19 infection that was found during testing, ranging from 37% to 0% over the course of 8 weeks. This variability meant that daily admissions ranged from 0 to 17, making it di cult to predict sta ng needs.",

Guidance documents for staff promoted a harm reduction approach. These units collaborated with harm reduction agencies which provided harm reduction materials, including sterile syringes and naloxone rescue kits. People who used drugs or alcohol were not discharged for substance use. Staff worked with guests to stay safe (personal communication, Dr. Alex Walley, Medical Director for Overdose Prevention Program, MA Dept. of Public Health). Within the CRU, it was challenging to fully implement a harm-reduction approach. There was disagreement over the appropriate approach, with many medical staff advocating for harm-reduction, while security personnel as well as some staff and administration o cials expressed concerns regarding safety on hospital grounds and public perception regarding laws that prohibit supervised injection sites. A compromise included distribution of sterile syringes at the time of discharge (rather than admission), and a policy of having clinicians, rather than security personnel, address use of substances.",

In early March 2020, addiction and infectious disease specialists at BMC began conversations with BMC leadership about the need to create capacity for PEH with COVID-19 to isolate and receive care, even if they did not require hospitalization. Clinical and strategy-team leaders began daily meetings with a group of organizations that provide care for PEH in Boston, including the Boston Public Health Commission, Department of Neighborhood Development, and Bureau of Recovery Services; harm reduction programs; and Boston Healthcare for the Homeless program, to forecast needs and develop alternative care sites.In late-March, screening revealed high prevalence of COVID-19 infection in shelters. It became clear that larger facilities with expanded capacity were needed for PEH who were infected with COVID-19 in order to prevent rampant viral transmission. Within BMC, clinical leaders raised reasonable concerns about diverting workforce from sta ng inpatient and intensive care units during the predicted surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations. However, the hospital CEO advocated for BMC addressing this public health need in Boston. Hospital leadership were also uni ed around a goal of preserving BMC's ability to serve the community through the crisis. Like many hospitals, BMC expected to reach maximum bed capacity, and leadership was motivated to identify alternate care sites for patients who needed isolation but did not need to occupy inpatient beds. BMC leadership asked the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to loan BMC a vacant hospital building near the BMC campus for the development of a COVID Recuperation Unit (CRU) to serve PEH. On March 24, 2020, state leaders agreed.",

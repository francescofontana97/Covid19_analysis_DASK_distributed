In this research, we use a large secondary dataset of automotive purchases (N = 323,959) to investigate how advertising spending differentially moderates the positive impact of both customer-and retailerdirected price incentives on consumers' premium level of purchase for vertically differentiated products. We find that higher advertising spending magnifies the positive impact of customer-directed price incentives on consumers' preference for more premium purchases. In contrast, higher advertising spending attenuates the positive impact of retailer-directed price incentives on consumers' preference for more premium purchases. Our work is distinct from previous research, which has almost exclusively focused on the CPG industry and the effects of advertising and price promotions on general demand metrics-instead of consumers' preferences for premium products. Our work has important implications for practitioners and consumer welfare.",

Prior research has found that durable goods firms also offer price incentives to entice consumers to purchase more expensive or \"upmarket\" options in their vertical product line-ups (Blattberg & Wisniewski, 1989; Kamakura & Russell, 1989; Quelch et al., 1987) . As such, offering price incentives is one way that firms' can satisfy their desire to sell more profitable premium products-or products that are positioned higher in a vertically differentiated lineup (Cohn, 2015; Johnson & Friend, 2015; Kamakura, 2008; Mantrala et al., 2010) . Notably, durable goods firms tend to offer price incentives in parallel with their other marketing efforts, such as advertising campaigns (Quelch et al., 1987) . For example, the automotive industry spent an average of $4,000 on price incentives per vehicle at the end of 2019 (JD Power, 2019) and an average of $2,023 on advertising in 2018 (Borrell Associates, 2018) . However, little is known about how these efforts interact with one another.",

We examine two distinct, but commonly used, types of price incentive-customer-directed and retailer-directed. We test our theory using a dataset that combines six data sources with more than 320,000 real automotive transactions in the United States. Further, we test the robustness of our model using sixteen robustness tests, three endogeneity checks, an alternative longitudinal secondary dataset from a different purchase context, and two experimental robustness tests.

First, previous research on price incentives indicates that offering larger price incentive amounts is positively associated with consumers' increased preference for premium goods (Blattberg & Wisniewski, 1989; Busse et al., 2006; Kamakura & Russell, 1989) . However, we find that this premium effect of price incentives is moderated by firms' simultaneously occurring product-level advertising spending. More importantly, we demonstrate that the premium effect of customer-and retailer-directed price incentives is moderated by advertising spending in distinct ways. Thus, our work is the first to look at how advertising spending simultaneously and differentially moderates the positive impact of both customer-and retailerdirected price incentives on consumers' premium level of purchase.",

Although researchers have long acknowledged that price incentives impact behavior (e.g., Neslin, 2002) , relatively few studies have sought to identify whether different types of price incentives have distinct impacts on consumer decisions (Miller et al., 2019; Okada, 2001; Okada, 2006; Zhu et al., 2008) . Importantly, even the few studies that have differentiated incentive type effects have not investigated the differences between customer-and retailer-directed incentives or these incentives' interaction with advertising. Practitioners should benefit from our findings, as they suggest that durable goods firms should not use retailer-directed incentives and advertising at the same time if they have a goal of upselling consumers to more premium products.",

On the other hand, the present work investigates consumers' preference for more premium purchases in vertically differentiated product line-ups-such as those commonly used in durable goods industries-using automotive industry data. This contribution is important given the inherent structural differences in how CPG industries versus durable goods industries pay out customer-versus retailer-directed incentives, which we detail in the next section. These differences help explain why the premium effect of retailer-directed incentives is attenuated by advertising spending, something that has not been previously observed. From a practitioner perspective, our work is the first to inform durable goods firms how their promotional strategies may impact sales of vertically differentiated products at the retailer-in the discussion we provide an overview of how incentives and advertising impact firms' sales in dollars. These firms must often incentivize independent (and sometimes uncooperative) retailers to sell specific product models, so a better understanding of how firm-level promotions influence selling at the retailer is crucial for meeting firm-level goals related to key metrics such as profit and inventory.",

In other words, despite their increased spending on retailer-directed incentives and advertising, manufacturers are inadvertently motivating retailers to act in ways that do not positively impact their own profitability. Further, consumers lose out because they end up with less premium purchases than they otherwise could afford if the retailer-directed incentive was passed through.

Specifically, because price incentives effectively reduce the price that consumers pay, they entice consumers to consider more premium offerings-or products that are positioned higher in a vertically differentiated lineup-than they could otherwise afford (Blattberg & Wisniewski, 1989; Kamakura & Russell, 1989; Quelch et al., 1987; Sivakumar & Raj, 1997) . One potential explanation for this effect is that, for a variety of reasons (e.g., status signaling, perceived quality), consumers inherently prefer premium products (Braun & Wicklund, 1989; Gao et al., 2009; Han et al., 2010; Miller & Brannon, 2021; Sivanathan & Pettit, 2010) . This is further supported by literature showing asymmetric effects of promotion on product choice, such that consumers are drawn more to discounted products when they perceive these products to be higher versus lower in quality (Bronnenberg & Wathieu, 1996; Hardie et al., 1993; Heath et al., 2000) . Therefore, when price incentives give consumers an opportunity to purchase premium products at a discount, they are likely to shift their preferences towards these offerings. Relatedly, recent work suggests that emotional responses to price incentives also stimulate consumers' desire for premium products (Shaddy & Lee, 2020) .",

This was then compared to their preferred model in the absence of a price incentive. Consistent with expectations, participants in the high incentive condition showed a larger shift towards more premium models (M high incentive change = .568) than did participants in the low incentive condition (M low incentive change = .136; F(1, 174) = 13.22, p < .001) (see Web Appendices A and B for a more detailed description of the study and stimuli). 1 Thus, the results of previous research, as well as our own pre-test, provide evidence that price incentives increase consumers' premium level of purchase-i.e., have a premium effect.",

Indeed, researchers have suggested that for limited 1 Although we report the difference in the choice (after vs. before incentive) as the dependent variable for the sake of simplicity, a repeated measures ANOVA of the 2 (Low Incentive vs. High Incentive) \u00d7 2 (Before Incentive vs. After Incentive) yielded a significant interaction (F(1, 173) = 13.22, p < .001) where those in the large incentive condition chose a more premium model after the incentive (M after incentive = 3.15) than before the incentive (M before incentive = 2.58; F(1, 174) = 45.83, p < .001) while those in small incentive condition did not choose a more premium model after the incentive (M after incentive = 2.78; M before incentive = 2.64; F(1, 174) = 2.53, p > .10).",

Much less work has investigated retailer-directed price incentives-monetary incentives targeted towards the retailer. The limited research in this domain has investigated the factors that influence the amount of retailer-directed incentive that firms pass-through to the consumer (Ailawadi & Harlam, 2009; Kumar et al., 2001) .

We argue that, as a result of these differences, advertising magnifies the premium effect of customerdirected incentives but, counterintuitively, mitigates the premium effect of retailer-directed incentives. In order to motivate these arguments, we first outline the role of pre-purchase consideration sets on consumer decision making at the pointof-purchase.",

Upon arriving at the point-of-purchase, their ultimate decision is heavily influenced by memory-based retrieval of the products in their consideration set (Nedungadi, 1990) . This is especially true for high-involvement durables such as automobiles, where unplanned and impulse purchases at the retailer are less likely to occur (Kardes et al., 1993; Sambandam & Lord, 1995) . In this sense, the options that consumers consider for purchase are often \"fixed\" by outside factors before they set foot in the retailer.",

Product-level advertising plays a critical role in providing information to consumers and increasing their knowledge about products in the marketplace during consideration set formation (Abernethy & Franke, 1996; Nelson, 1974) . The information in advertisements can shift brand associations (De Vries et al., 2017) , change consumers' price sensitivity (Kaul & Wittink, 1995; Xu et al., 2014) , and facilitate favorable attitudes through mere exposure (Liu-Thompkins, 2019). Indeed, the information contained in advertisements affects what products consumers consider prior to a sales transaction (Batra & Keller, 2016) , such that prior work has found that advertising spending for a specific product increases consumers' consideration of that product in relation to other products in the same market (Mehta et al., 2003; Terui et al., 2011) . Thus, by communicating both price and non-price product information, advertising increases consumers' knowledge of the products that are advertised and helps to solidify their preferences-i.e., fix their consideration sets-prior to purchase (Mitra, 1995; Narayanan et al., 2004; Sahni, 2015; Sahni, 2016) .",

As discussed previously and demonstrated in the pre-test, knowledge of customer-directed incentives should generally entice consumers to consider more premium offerings-i.e., have a premium effect-because they act to discount the price of premium products to align with consumers' budgets.

Given that greater product awareness tends to increase consideration (Batra & Keller, 2016; Mehta et al., 2003; Terui et al., 2011) , this should facilitate consumers' shift towards wanting the more premium products that they may not have otherwise considered. Next, advertising also provides consumers with additional positive information about these premium offerings (e.g., performance, styling, features) which should additionally solidify their desire for these products. In other words, although customer-directed incentives allow consumers to consider more premium products that would otherwise have been above their budget, product-level advertising provides greater awareness and information about these products. This should solidify consumers' consideration of more premium products prior to their arrival at the retailer, making them more likely to pursue the in-store purchase of these products. 2 Thus, we posit that greater product-level advertising spending should magnify the positive impact of larger (vs. smaller) customer-directed incentives by fixing consumers' consideration sets on more premium products prior to their arrival at the retailer.",

For instance, while CPG retailers may forward buy to increase retailer-directed incentives-i.e., they buy more wholesale-there is no incentive for durable goods retailers (such as automotive dealers) to forward buy (Bruce et al., 2005) .

In other words, these incentives are never posted, advertised, or communicated to consumers prior to their entry to the retailer. Thus, they only pass-through to the final consumer as a result of price bargaining at the point-of-purchase. Again, this contrasts with the CPG industry, which reduces the posted price of products to account for any retailerdirected incentives that are passed on to the consumer (Busse et al., 2006) . Importantly, we are not suggesting that all retailer-directed price incentives in the CPG industry are passed through to the consumer. Instead, we are suggesting that when a CPG retailer-directed price incentive is passed through to the consumer, consumers are aware of a price change in the product they are buying-which explains why many of the previously studied effects of retailer-directed incentives mirror the effects of customer-directed incentives (e.g. Ailawadi & Harlam, 2009; Haans & Gijsbrechts, 2011) . Critically, this is not the case with durable goods. Instead, with durable goods, the retailer chooses when and how much of the retailer-directed incentive to pass-through to the consumer, and this pass-through is often-though not always-hidden within the negotiated price. As a result of this payout structure, we argue that consumer and retailer motivations will align to make a deal on comparatively less premium offerings.",

It is important to note that we make this prediction based on the notion that retailer-directed incentives do not interact with advertising during pre-purchase consideration set formation (because consumers have no knowledge of them), but rather after consumers have already entered the retailer. Thus, in the case of retailer-directed incentives, exposure to outside-ofstore advertising does not lead consumers to consider more premium offerings.

In this program, consumers who met the minimum requirements received incentives to trade in older automobiles-with poor gas mileage-in order to purchase new automobiles-with better gas mileageto help stimulate the auto industry. Consumers had to trade in a working vehicle less than 25 years old with an average MPG of 18 or less and consumers had to have owned and continuously insured it for the previous yearthus these are unforced replacement purchases (Grewal et al., 2004) . The program ran from July 1, 2009, through August 24, 2009. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to study how different promotions impact consumer choice for several reasons. First, this dataset details customerdirected and retailer-directed incentive amounts, as well as advertising spending for all the products in the consumer automobile market. Thus, using this dataset, we can test for the role of customer-and retailer-directed incentives. Second, our dataset includes both the previously purchased product and the new purchase. Since previous research has shown that upgrading behavior is impacted by mental accounting associated with consumers' previous purchase (Okada, 2001 (Okada, , 2006 , this dataset allows us to control for these effects and test the impact of promotional activities on purchase behavior beyond the effects accounted for in previous literature. Finally, some consumers may consider less premium automobiles-which generally get better gas mileage than more premium options-more preferable to more premium automobiles because of their preference for gas mileage performance. However, since the new vehicle had to get better gas mileage than the trade-in, we are able to control for preferences to reduce operating costs (fuel efficiency), which could be an endogenous explanation for some consumers to purchase less premium options.",

Using the MSRP of the product chosen by the consumer-in contrast to the price consumers actually pay-is ideal because the MSRP of the product allows us to compare the level of premium product chosen by consumers without introducing potential sources of endogeneity that may arise from using the end price that a consumer pays for a product. For instance, by using the MSRP of the product chosen, we avoid endogeneity attributable to a consumers' ability to negotiate a lower price during the transaction and a retailer's flexibility in the price if it needs to sell a product in order to meet potential financial obligations.

We calculate a rolling 16 weeks (4 months) of advertising spending before the week of the transaction, since consumers' automobile shopping process takes, on average, about four months (JD Power, 2013) . We use the carryover estimate suggested in previous literature of .5 per period (Lodish et al., 1995) to account for advertising decay. Thus, in line with previous research, the earliest advertising (16 weeks before the sale) is discounted the most, whereas the week before the sale is not discounted. Further, we divide each product's DMA spending by the total advertising spending within the DMA to reduce the possibility that media spending in large DMAs disproportionately impacts our findings. As a result, this variable represents the proportionate share of advertising of each individual product-e.g., the Toyota Camry-by DMA.",

We suggested that one reason for this effect is because consumers' preferences are more fixed (because of the advertising) and, as a result, there is no incentive for the retailer to upsell since the retailer is receiving incentive money for the purchase the consumer already wants. Since our work incorporates both consumer and retailer behavior, this effect is difficult to replicate experimentally. Yet research suggests that brand loyal consumers also have more fixed preferences (Dick & Basu, 1994) . Making use of this known relationship, we test the fixed consideration set component of our theory in the following tests. First, automotive manufacturers produce multiple brands as a part of their vertical product strategy, such as Toyota and Lexus, or Kia and Hyundai. Thus, we count a consumer as brand family loyal if their new purchase and trade-in vehicle brands are from the same brand family. If consumers' preferences become more fixed as a result of advertising, we would expect our hypothesized effect (H2) to be stronger (or more negative) for loyal consumers than for non-loyal consumers. Thus, we include brand loyalty in an interaction with advertising spending and retailer-directed incentives. We observe a more negative impact (b = \u2212614.38, p < .01) while we still find support for H1 (b = 27.33, p < .001) and H2 (b = \u2212357.23, p < .01)-see Model 4.",

            "text": "Unobserved heterogeneity robustness tests: vehicle type, brand, and ZIP code fixed effects models To ensure our results are robust to potential differences in the consumer decision making processes, we provide the result of several fixed effect models. First, to account for the fact that some consumers may choose a vehicle type and then decide on the level of premium purchase they want within that type, we estimate a vehicle type fixed effect model. In other words, we identified each new purchase as belonging to one of the five major automobile types: sedans, sportscars, vans, sport utility vehicles, and trucks. As a result, this model provides estimates of our hypotheses within each vehicle type (see Model 6). Additionally, to account for the fact that some consumers may choose a brand and then decide on the level of premium purchase they want within the brand, we estimate a brand fixed effect model. We remove the variable that captures the styling of the new vehicle from this analysis because it is at the brand level. Thus, while we use brand level dummies in our main model, this model provides estimates of our hypotheses within each brand (see Model 7). One potential explanation for our counterintuitive observation of a negative effect of the interaction between retailer-directed incentives and advertising spending may be that some retailers carried a different selection of products than other retailers. Potentially, these different selections may have been optimized for collecting retailer-directed incentives associated with less premium products. For instance, a small retailer in a rural area may know the patterns of manufacturers' retailerdirected incentives and may focus on carrying less premium options that typically have high retailer-directed incentives-this is in contrast to the model free correlational evidence which suggests higher retailer-directed incentives on more expensive vehicles (r = .017, p < .05). Thus, to account for this possibility, we estimate a ZIP code fixed effect model while including brand dummies. In other words, we control for the unobserved characteristics of each branded store within a ZIP code and our observed effects are due to the variance within the ZIP code controlling for each brand. See Model 8 for the results of this test. We find support for H1 and H2 in all of these models. See Table 3 for these results.",

As a result, an entry level product would be ranked 1 while a premium luxury level product would be ranked 26 (the highest ranking).

While this reasoning is flimsy given that consumers are unaware of retailer-directed incentives, one potential argument may be that retailers are selectively communicating price discounts from retailer-directed incentives to consumers not in the market, in a way that we are unable to measure.

Specifically, with regard to customer-and retailer-directed incentives, one may argue that managers may increase these incentives on specific models because those models are not performing well-as may be indicated by the zero order correlations between the customer-and retailer-directed incentives and styling, quality, and technology control variables. Similarly, one may argue that advertising's ability to restrict a consumer's consideration set-as proposed in our process-is only possible if consumers are exposed to that advertising. These alternative explanations are consistent with omitted variable bias (Rutz & Watson, 2019) . To account for this potential endogeneity, we employ the latent-variable method proposed by Lewbel (2012) . This approach can be used with cross-sectional data and is specified in the Stata routine ivreg2h (Baum & Schaffer, 2020) . Thus, we use mean-centered versions of our variables to create instruments for customer-directed incentives in Model 20, retailer-directed incentives in Model 21, and advertising spending in Model 22.

Specifically, in our theorizing we suggested that consumers who receive a large customer-directed incentive and are exposed to a large amount of advertising should broaden their consideration set to include more premium products. To test this process, we recruited 200 participants using Amazon's Mechanical Turk and randomly assigned them to a 2 (small vs. large customer-directed incentive) \u00d7 2 (low vs. high advertising exposure) between-subjects experiment. 5 In all conditions, we used Rivian's electric vehicle-an \"adventure electric vehicle\" manufacturer-because it is a new brand that has yet to launch a formal advertising campaign or produce a vehicle. Using promotional materials from Rivian that showed different versions of Rivian's electric SUV, we showed participants in the low (high) advertising exposure condition one (six) print advertisement for Rivian's electric vehicle. In both of these conditions, we also included advertisements for other products (e.g., Doritos, iPhone, etc.) such that each participant viewed 10 advertisements overall. After participants viewed the set of 10 advertisements they were told of customer cash ($500 in the low condition, $4500 in the high condition) associated with the most premium Rivian SUV. Next, we had participants choose the level of Rivian electric vehicle they would prefer-participants could choose from 5 levels of Rivian electric vehicles at different price points (ranging from $32.5 k to $52.5 k in $5 k increments). We tracked the amount of time that consumers took to choose the Rivian electric vehicle they would prefer as a way to measure the amount of time consumers took to create their consideration set-we winsorized this variable at 90% to limit the effect of extreme outliers. We anticipated that the larger incentive and larger advertising exposure would lead to a longer consideration timeas consumers update their consideration set-which should lead them to choose a more premium option. We control for participants' age, income, gender, and previous knowledge of Rivian electric vehicles.

We also stressed that the consumer does not know about this bonus money. Finally, we told participants to imagine that a consumer comes into the dealership that is interested in the middlelevel electric SUV (R3s) and that \"They are sure what they want and already have the R3s specifically in mind\" (fixed preferences condition to align with high advertising spending) or \"They are unsure what they want and do not have a specific vehicle in mind\" (flexible preferences condition to align with low advertising spending).

Specifically, for participants in the large retailer-directed incentive condition, we find that participants in the fixed preferences condition gave the consumer significantly less pass-through (M fixed = $1185.36, SD = $683.92) than participants in the flexible preferences condition (M flexible = $1374.82, SD = $560.92; F(1, 284) = 8.87, p < .01).

Thus, in combination with our pre-test results and secondary data analysis, which shows that the larger the incentive money given to the consumer the more premium purchase they choose, we show that retailers choose to keep more retailer-directed incentive when consumers have fixed (vs. flexible) preferences. We theorized that such behavior attenuates the premium effect of retailerdirected incentives by decreasing the amount of pass-through discount that consumers receive. Importantly, we believe these results should be interpreted with caution, as participants were not salespeople at a car dealership. However, we believe that our results generally speak to the notion that people will keep incentive money for themselves when it is beneficial to do so.",

However, if our theory is correct, we should see similar effects in other industries where price incentive structures are similar, and where consumers make one-time, highinvolvement purchases at the retailer. Thus, we further test our model using a different secondary dataset from another industry-river cruise purchases. Similar to the automotive industry and durable goods, river cruise firms advertise customer-but not retailer-directed price incentives. These retailer-directed incentives are also paid to the retailer (travel agency) based on retail sales-similar to the durable goods.",

First, this dataset is from a single firm in a non-recessionary period. Thus, while researchers have found that Cash-for-Clunkers participants are representative of other car buyers in general (Mian & Sufi, 2012) , a criticism of our main dataset may be that the data were collected during a recession and, therefore, consumers may be more predisposed to buying less premium purchases. Second, while we control for brand effects in our main dataset (using brand dummies and fixed effects), one alternative explanation could be that the size of customerand retailer-directed incentives may be endogenous with the brand that consumers select. Thus, this alternative dataset provides another within-brand test of our hypotheses. As such, this alternative dataset is useful because (1) it was not collected during a recession, (2) was not collected as a result of a government incentive program, and (3) it provides the opportunity to test our hypotheses in a services context where both customer-and retailer-directed incentive structures mirror the durable goods industry. Finally, one may argue that our observations from the automotive dataset may be due to unobserved consumer or retailer characteristics that could influence consumers' choice. Another benefit of this dataset is that it is longitudinal and we are able to run fixed effects models accounting for any unobserved time-invariant characteristics of the consumer and the retailer that may impact consumers' preferences for more premium purchases-such as retailer specific price promotions.",

Our analysis reveals that advertising spending interacts with customer-directed price incentives to increase consumers' propensity to choose premium offerings (H1). In contrast, advertising spending interacts with retailer-directed price incentives to decrease consumers' tendency to choose premium products (H2). Our findings suggest that promotional tools commonly used by firms can have offsetting results when (Okada, 2001) or increase the premium level of product chosen (Miller et al., 2019) , they may also have a detrimental impact on consumer vertical product line movement depending on a firm's advertising strategy. As a result, our work provides insight into an underresearched aspect of the promotional tools that firms use on a daily basis. Thus, by investigating how retailer-directed incentives and advertising combine to impact consumers' premium preferences, we show the potential downside to utilizing price incentives that are invisible to consumers prior to a sales transaction, when such incentives are offered in parallel with heavy advertising. More importantly, this research fills a critical gap in the existing literature, which has not previously investigated how advertising moderates both customerdirected and retailer-directed incentives. This gap is surprising given that practitioners frequently use these three promotional tools simultaneously.",

Instead, we study durable goods where retailer-directed incentives are paid out based on retail performance. In other words, while these incentives share a name, our work offers insights into how incentive structures, when combined with advertising, alter retailer and consumer motivations in purchase transactions. Specifically, we show that the nuance in understanding how a retailer-directed incentive is paid out is important because it can alter consumers' decisions amongst vertically differentiated products. Additionally, past studies using data from the CPG industry have looked at general performance metrics such as sales, market share, and quantity of goods sold. Instead, our work is the first to investigate consumers' choice among more versus less premium offerings. This is notable, as practitioners in durable goods and services industries commonly use advertising and price promotions to influence consumers' level of premium purchase.

            "text": "Second, firms should not use a combination of retailerdirected incentives and advertising at the same time if they or their retailers have a primary goal of upselling consumers to premium offerings. The combination of both of these promotional tools limits consumers' consideration of premium products prior to the sales transaction and mitigates the retailer's motivation to upsell. For instance, according to our analysis, when a manufacturer offers a $400 retailer-directed incentive with no advertising spending, consumers buy a vehicle worth about $38,700. However, a small .4% increase in advertising share drops consumers' spending to about $37,500, or $1,200. Yet, advertising's negative moderating effect is more dramatic with higher retailer-directed incentives. For instance, if a manufacturer increases the retailerdirected incentive to $1,000 with no advertising spending, consumers buy a vehicle worth about $39,000. However, the same .4% increase in advertising share drops consumer spending to about $36,100, or $2,900. Admittedly, the negative result of combining advertising and retailer-directed incentives may seem counterintuitive-consumers select less premium products than they would otherwise. However, managers may be able to mitigate this negative interaction by only using retailer-directed incentives for products higher in their vertical line-up. While this action would not affect consumers' consideration set prior to the sales transaction, it would at least incentivize retailers in their upsell efforts.",

Specifically, retailer-directed incentives are popular because they do not deteriorate the value of the brand from the consumer's perspective (Jedidi et al., 1999; Yoo et al., 2000) . However, our results indicate that they do have a detrimental impact on the financial return to the manufacturing firm-the consumer purchases a lower price and, likely, lower-profitability option. In contrast, customer-directed incentives may negatively impact consumers' perceived value of the brand, but provide a better financial return-the consumer purchases a higher price, and, likely, higherprofitability option.",

Yet, given that economic crises may impact overall demand within an industry-such as the economic crisis associated with the COVID-19 outbreak-firms may need to switch strategies to maintain profitability. As such, understanding how retailer-directed incentives-which may normally increase sales of a product-also reduce consumers' propensity to choose more premium purchases, is important for practitioners to understand. See Fig. 2a and b for an overview of how advertising moderates the positive relationship between customer-and retailer-directed incentives and the premium level of purchase chosen. Finally, our work adds more nuance to previous efforts to uncover the asymmetric effects of brand switching as a result of promotional efforts (Bronnenberg & Wathieu, 1996; Hardie et al., 1993; Heath et al., 2000) . Specifically, our results highlight the importance of sales processes and promotional payout methods associated with different purchases. In other words, much of previous work focused on brand switching due to promotional efforts was focused on low-involvement purchases with no sales force interaction. Our work suggests this interaction with high-involvement purchases is a critical aspect to understanding choice.",

Yet researchers have shown that while the number of purchases decreases during a recession, the proportion of premium purchases to non-premium purchases does not change (Davis & Boundy, 2012) . Additionally, previous research has shown that the CARS program pulled forward purchases that would have taken place anyway in later months (Mian & Sufi, 2012) . In other words, previous research has already shown that buyers that participated in this program are representative of new car buyers in general. Beyond the empirical results of previous research, we also point out that our results were consistent in an alternative secondary dataset of river cruise purchases collected during a non-recessionary time period. Additionally, our results suggest a difference in incentive types' interaction with advertising. A recessionary period would not provide an adequate explanation for why we find positive main effects of both incentive types, nor would it explain the distinction in interaction effects we observe.",

However, that our results were consistent using a brand fixed effects model and a longitudinal dataset of a single firm in a different industry suggests that our work may represent the overall effect of the interaction between advertising and price incentive strategies. Future work could explore how differing advertising strategies-the auto industry is known for its price focused advertising which likely explains its negative impact on premium purchases-may alter this main effect and advertising's interaction with incentive types in order to make it easier for retailers to upsell consumers at the point of purchase.",

            "text": "Given the relative lack of research investigating how retailer-directed incentives interact with other marketing actions, particularly outside of the CPG industry, there are plenty of other opportunities for future research. For instance, researchers should investigate the best incentive strategies based on the number of levels within a vertical product line-up. For instance, our work suggests that while retailer-directed incentives may reduce the premium level of purchase chosen by consumers, focusing these retailer-directed incentives only on premium purchases may still entice retailers to upsell consumers. This would suggest that there is some optimal strategy for how to apply customer-and retailer-directed incentives to vertical product line-ups. This strategy, to the best of our knowledge, is currently not known and may differ depending on the industry in which the firm operates and the firm's sales goals. Future work should also consider the interaction that firms' promotional efforts have with retailers' quota strategies for their sales forces. Understanding the nuance in specific Fig. 2 a Interaction of advertising share and customer-directed incentives on consumers' premium purchases. b Interaction of advertising share and retailer-directed incentives on customers' premium purchases retailers' efforts would further help researchers' and practitioners' abilities to predict purchase decisions based on their promotional strategies. Finally, our work suggests that there may be other counterintuitive effects of retailer-directed incentives that future research should try and untangle. For instance, while retailerdirected incentives do not undermine the value of a brand like customer-directed incentives (Jedidi et al., 1999; Yoo et al., 2000) , they may undermine consumers' willingness-to-pay at specific retailers. In other words, given the ubiquity of wordof-mouth platforms, consumers are now better able to share the deals they receive on durable goods as a result of retailerdirected incentives. As a result, retailers who pass on the retailer-directed incentive may gain a reputation for discount selling that may reduce consumers' willingness-to-pay at that retailer. Thus, future work may try to disentangle whether there is asymmetry in retailer-directed incentives' impact on a manufacturer's brand-i.e., no undermining effect-versus a retailer's brand-i.e., undermines consumers' willingnessto-pay. 6 ",

Based on evaluations by the United Nations (2014), the share of urban population is estimated to increase by 65% by 2050. The increase could drive urban areas heading for better socioeconomic prosperity and enhanced community wellbeing (World Bank Group, 2015) . According to the United Nations (2014), the concentration of urbanization driven demographic shift is a prominent feature in the global cities (Mouratidis, 2018) . In this regard, research on liveability and its impact on the community wellbeing are gaining significant grounds (Kytt\u00e4 et al., 2015) . Policymakers and urban practitioners seem progressively engrossed with raising arguments favouring explanations of existing liveability practices around the globe (Ruth and Franklin, 2014) . Most of them have considered the idea of liveability from an urban sustainability point of view (Zhan et al., 2018) . Improving liveability through socio-economic equity and decreasing the environmental impacts of multiple urban operations, owing to the fast speed of urbanization is the main concern of this approach (Li and Weng 2007) . As a result, policymakers and advocacy groups suggest liveability approaches as the elementary standard by which to assess the depth of living standards of cities across the globe.",

In general, liveability is the sum of the socio-physical and socio-cultural factors that can improve and upgrade living standards of any spaces (Jomehpour, 2015) ; with the current crisis around CoVID-19 highlighting its centrality. The concept, as it is used today, first appeared during the 1950s in Vancouver as a strong linguistic mechanism with the Electors Action Movement (Mansour, 2016) . During 1980s the term liveability became a catchphrase in urban studies after Donald Appleyard introduced it in his book 'Liveable Streets' (Yassin, 2019) . However, in 2009, the term has gained noteworthy attention as a set of guideline principal from the new Partnership for Sustainable Communities (PSC).",

Scholars, especially from the American and European perspectives, explored liveability researches in the early 1990s (Barry, 2007; Rusk, 2010; Kashef, 2016; Chang, 2016; Vela, Lerma and Ikonomopoulos, 2017) . However, this trend has started in the East too, especially in Asian countries, during early 2000. Asian countries, mainly, China, India, Malaysia, Taiwan and Korea, are quite well researched with regards to liveability politics (Ellis and Roberts, 2016; Randhawa and Kumar, 2017; Li and Yao, 2018) . Initially, they conducted research based on accessible physical amenities and facilities (Wyatt, 2009; Tilaki et al., 2014; Gough, 2015; Kashef, 2016; Xu and Guo, 2017) ; however, in the course of globalization and adoption of liberalization, the trend shifts towards evaluating the socio-economic impacts of rising urbanization within cities has also emerged.",

            "text": "The term liveability has been used as a policy approach by those involved in urban governance (Li and Yao 2018) . Liveability is a holistic paradigm of human development and community well-being, which is based on the augmentation of twin physical-environmental and cultural dimensions of cities and their associated regions (Balsas, 2004; Wyatt, certain physical spaces, with appropriate preparedness in the cultural and environmental dimensions as its prerequisite (Tilaki et al., 2014; Onnom et al., 2018; Yassin, 2019) . In most cases, various scholars/organizations derived their explanation of liveability approaches based on their perspectives and contexts of their research. Like, Clinton Liveability Agenda (1999) had defined it as a best practice that encourages communities to maintain green space, eco-friendly transportation choices and pursues regional intelligent growth policies for a sustainable future (National Research Council, 2002) . Australian Bureau of Statistics (2012), explanation is heavily related to well-being and can also be used in a collective context to define how well a society meets the requirements and needs of its own people (Paul and Sen, 2017) . It is therefore evident that the dimensions of liveability approaches include many complex characteristics, urban patterns and forms (Farber et al. 2016) . Most researchers and policy makers embrace it as self-explanatory and as a reference to the living standards or overall wellbeing of cities, with several international agencies forging numerous liveability approaches to understand living standards of cities (Murray, 2011; Shamsuddin, Hassan, and Bilyamin, 2012; Onnom et al., 2018; Paul and Sen, 2018) .",

Followed by, the Mercer's Quality of Life (QoL) survey, which ranks numerous global cities in terms of their living standards (Mercer, 2018 ). Mercer's QoL survey delivers appropriate recommendations for 450 global cities based on ten selected and recommended socio-economic indicators. In 2018, for instance, Vienna (Austria) tops the rank across the globe followed by Z\u00fcrich (Switzerland) and Auckland (New-Zealand). The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducts Better Life Index (BLI) to survey to measure liveability based on eleven social-environmental-economic factors. Lastly, American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), a public institute, initiates the liveability index for the American cities (American Association of Retired Persons, 2015). Due to the growing pace of urbanization and its association with the population growth mainly older adults, this index focuses on liveable communities based on housing quality, neighbourhood aspirations, transportation options, environmental quality, health, and economic engagements.",

Due to the notion of their assessment procedures, the impressions of liveability have evolved within cities (Leby and Hashim 2010) . Here, the secondary and tertiary activities are more predominant features, and the impact of human activities on urban environment is a more prominent characteristic (Aziz and Hadi 2007) . From socio-economic, cultural, and environmental views, urban areas, especially cities around the world, are getting more attention by researchers to explore different shades of liveability variations and the intrinsic potential for urban and social development within them (Li and Weng 2007). \u2022 Second, it is further evident that cities are a major centre of attraction in terms of economic potentialities, community well-being and hope for the better living standard. People want to live in cities to appreciate the financial benefits with associated amenities and level of services. In this respect, the global ranking tools have touched critical issues linked to peoples' perception of liveability and the degree to which the cities meet their requirements and aspirations. Subsequently, urban governance seems to be progressively engrossed with the concept of liveability and become an innovative tool for better shaping the future of cities.",

However, later onwards, the global East has understood that apart from the physical aspects, socio-cultural dimensions are equally significant aspects for assessing liveability of any cities and regions. The second deals with the conception and dimension of liveability. Based on the empirical assessments, the paper demarcates liveability as a composite notion with many complicated features and urban patterns and forms, encompass several multifaceted extents and states of inclusive wellbeing (National Research Council, 2002) . The third denotes a contemporary liveability assessment tool to understand the pattern of living standards across the globe.

In this work, we present ACTA (Advanced Cognitive Training for Aging), a prototypal mobile-health solution to provide advanced cognitive training for senior citizens with mild cognitive impairments, We disclose here the conceptualization of ACTA as the integration of two promising rehabilitation strategies: the \"Nudge theory\", from the cognitive domain, and the neurofeedback, from the neuroscience domain. Moreover, in ACTA we exploit the most advanced machine learning techniques to deliver customized and fully adaptive support to the elderly, while training in an ecological environment. ACTA represents the next-step beyond SENIOR, an earlier mobile-health project for cognitive training based on Nudge theory, currently ongoing in Lombardy Region. Beyond SENIOR, ACTA represents a highly-usable, accessible, low-cost, new-generation mobile-health solution to promote independent aging and effective motor-cognitive training support, while empowering the elderly in their own aging.",

In many countries, especially Italy, Portugal in Europe, and Japan in Asia, average population age is rapidly increasing and projections indicate 79% of it will be over 60 by 2050, according to the 2017 report of the United Nations [1]. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is rapidly becoming one of the most common clinical manifestations affecting the elderly. It is characterized by deterioration of memory, attention, and cognitive function that is beyond what is expected based on age and educational level. MCI does not interfere significantly with individuals' daily activities. It can act as a transitional level towards dementia with a range of conversion of 10%-15% per year. It is crucial G. Cisotto is with the 2 to protect older people against MCI and developing dementia. As originally conceived, Petersen defined MCI by the following criteria: (1) a subjective complaint of a memory disturbance (preferably supported by an informant); (2) objective evidence of a memory deficit; (3) generally preserved cognitive functions; (4) intact activities of daily living; and (5) the absence of dementia [2] .",

            "text": "More recently, degeneration in MCI has been also addressed by neurofeedback (NFB) interventions [8, 9, 10, 11] . NFB is a strategy to obtain a self-regulation of specific neural substrates which, in turn, produces improvements of specific cognitive and motor functions [12] . The target neural activity (assumed to be pathological) is associated with an automatic output (e.g., a cursor moving on a computer screen), the patient is instructed to control the output and a positive reinforcement can be provided him/her to help them reach their goal: in fact, after some trials-and-errors, the patient learns to control the output. NFB is enabled by the basic principles of \"operant learning\" and \"brain plasticity\" [13, 14] . Operant learning is employed to create an association between brain activity and (cognitive) behaviour in real-time, and facilitates the learning process via reinforcement strategy. Brain plasticity, instead, is the key ability of the brain to adapt its own functionalities to finally control the output. While criticisms still persist on the mechanisms through which NFB may produce benefits to specific patients, an increasing bulk of evidence has proved it as effective to improve motor and cognitive (e.g., attention deficits, memory, cognitive flexibility, reaction time, and executive functions) functionalities in a variety of pathologies [12, 15, 16, 17], including MCI [18, 19, 20, 21] .",

EEGbased NFB is typically operated by Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), i.e., \"closed-loop\" human-machine systems that process EEG through several steps of pre-processing, feature extraction and classification, and transform the classifier's output in a command for an external device, e.g., a cursor on a computer or a robotic device navigating a room. During training, the machine refines its model of the user's brain activity and, at the same time, the human learns how to modulate his/her own brain activity to control the machine's output [14, 15] . Interestingly, [18] , the authors showed that central alpha EEG NFB was able to improve memory performance in MCI patients, and this outcome has been maintained at 30-day follow-up. Beta band EEG NFB was also reported to produce significant improvements to MCI patients in domains such as attention, memory, cognitive flexibility, reaction time, and executive functions [10].

Also, in the BCI community, an increasing effort to bring the promising results of NFB out-of-the-lab is being ongoing since a long time [28, 29, 30, 31, 32] . However, the research on the best strategies for improving learning in BCI remains a vivid field of investigation. Thus, SENIOR application of \"Nudge theory\" could represent a complimentary solution to improve learning in BCI research. Also, NFB could provide contingent intervention that could increase the effectiveness of \"Nudge theory\"-based cognitive training.",

In particular, ACTA will expand the methodologies of \"SENIOR -SystEm of Nudge theory based ICT applications for OldeR citizen\" (CARIPLO funded project ID 2018-NAZ-0129, rif. 2018-0826) project, currently ongoing at the University of Milano-Bicocca [6] . Going far beyond SENIOR, ACTA aims to design and test an integrated Nudge-NFB cognitive training by introducing a closed-loop assistance based on BCI and real-time quantitative assessments of the patient's conditions and attention level [9, 33] . Moreover, ACTA targets a new lowcost and wireless setup which could be used in less-controlled environments, i.e., in the patient's home, without the need of a clinical caregiver. At the same time, ACTA will provide the clinical caregiver with quantitative outcomes from the patient's behaviour and physiological conditions all throughout the course of the cognitive training. Thus, ACTA will provide a proof-of-concept that could be, later, easily extended to other use cases (i.e., motor disturbances in Parkinson's disease patients) or cognitive training programs (by adjusting the timings and the complexity of the implemented tasks) [17, 34, 31, 4] .",

All experimental protocols and procedures for the first experimental phase are currently under ethics approval by the IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano Ethical Committee. An additional approval will be requested to a Research Ethics Committee for the second experimental phase, which involves the use of neurofeedback via BCI. However, fully non invasive methodologies are employed (i.e., EEG) and the proposed NFB approach derives from standard BCI protocols. In fact, this kind of research has been previously approved in many different countries and many different pathologies [15, 20] , including MCI [34, 21, 3] . The eligible participants will be fully informed about the purpose, the experimental procedures, the data protection and treatment, the potential benefits and risks of taking part in this experiments. Then, they will be asked to sign a written and informed consent to take actual part in the project. Fig. 1 shows the overall architecture that is being deployed for ACTA. The latter implements the typical three-tier Internet-of-Things for healthcare (IoT-Health) architecture [5, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39] with the first tier including a wireless body area network (WBAN) for multi-modal sensing [40, 41] to collect physiogical data and vitals from the user (e.g., the heart rate via smartwatch's optical sensor, the brain activity via EEG), as well as the GPS position and the individual's movement (via accelerometer and gyroscope sensors). All data collected are sent through short-range wireless protocols, e.g., Bluetooth, to the smartphone that acts as a local gateway to access the Internet. At the second tier, the data are aggregated and further process before to reach the cloud. Here, mobile communications, e.g., 3G or 4G, or wi-fi are employed. The cloud, where data are stored and processed via advanced machine learning to identify individuals' profiles, represents the third tier of the IoT-Health architecture. Finally, the information about profiling are sent back, through the Internet, towards the local gateway to deliver nudges and neurofeedback stimuli, when needed. From a software point of view, at the front-end, we will extend the SENIOR app to integrate the new functionalities of ACTA (i.e., EEG acquisition, NFB delivery) and the user can run the app on his/her smartphone. At the backend, a Data Base Management System (DBMS) will store and analyze data on the cloud.",

TECNOB was a comprehensive two-phase stepped down program enhanced by tele-medicine for the medium-term treatment of obese and diabetic people seeking intervention for weight loss [49, 50] . Seventy-two obese patients with type 2 diabetes have been recruited and randomly allocated to the TECNOB program (n=37) or to a control condition (n=39). The TECNOB web-platform supported several functions and delivered many utilities, such as questionnaires, an animated food record diary, an agenda and a videoconference virtual room. All patients received a multi-sensory armband (SenseWear Pro3 Armband provided by BodyMedia), an electronic tool that enabled automatic monitoring of total energy expenditure (calories burned), active energy expenditure, physical activity duration and levels. They were instructed to wear the device on the back of their upper arm and to record data for 36 hours every two weeks in a free-living context. Also, the patients could ask for a teleconsultation with the clinical psychologist, to improve self-esteem and self-efficacy, to support motivation, to prevent relapse and to provide problem-solving. Within-group analysis showed a significant reduction of the initial weight at all time-points. The median percentage of the initial weight loss for the whole sample was \u22125, 1 kg (range from \u22126, 6 to \u22123, 7) at discharge from the hospital.",

We can notice that all of them are characterized by a low-to-medium sampling frequency (less than 1000 Hz), a limited number of channels (21 max), and a low-to-average price. Additionally, most of them are wireless, but do not have special noise reduction technologies, thus reducing the SNR (i.e., the quality) of the acquired signals. Bluetooth is the most common communications technology used to send the EEG samples to the smartphone or the computer wirelessly. Finally, it is worth mentioning for the most of them the EEG sensors are placed in compliance with the International 10-20 System or its extended version, i.e., the 10-10 system [62] .",

In the development of such \"closed-loop\", an \"open-loop\" training phase has to be planned for allowing the patient learn to control the machine (of the BCI system), and for the machine to optimize its model of the patient's brain activity. Therefore, ACTA aims to operate on the two following phases, as shown in Fig. 3 . During the first phase, ACTA aims to create a rich training set of EEG data (time series or graph metrics) associated with the nudges: in fact, we could extract as many EEG data as many nudges are delivered in the repetitions of the path. Particularly, if we assume that brain attention can be detected in the proximity of each landmark (as in standard oddball cognitive paradigms), we could label the corresponding EEG data with a positive tag [9, 66] . Similarly, if we assume that no attentional state is required during the journey between two consecutive landmarks (i.e., passing by the non-relevant places), then a negative label can be associated to the corresponding EEG data. Thus, we could exploit advanced supervised ML methods to train a binary classifier that could accurately classify the EEG data either as attention-related or non-attention related samples [67, 68, 69, 70, 71] . At this stage, several deep architectures can be used to identify the brain networks features which are related to the individual's attentional state. Moreover, by designing and implementating specific \"attentional mechanisms\", we could weight those pieces of EEG information that mostly impact on determining the classification of the individual's attentional level [67, 68] .",

To prolong the battery life in wearables, we decided to use them for basic sensing (i.e., heart rate) and to display stimuli when needed, while the full fledged Android smartphone (running Android OS) is used to access the Internet, synchronize the acquisition from different devices, store data in the cloud, run the SENIOR app, track the individual's position using GPS, provide feedback (as well as distractors of the task 2), as well as phone calls for emergency situations. Inter-operability is guaranteed by the use of semi-open Android smartwatches, in line with the choice made for SENIOR [5, 6] . This way we could take advantage of the full range of available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in the Android OS (e.g., Firebase cloud sync, Maps API, Text-to-speech API, Phone calls in emergency situations, etc.).

In this regards, it should be noted that, the demand for self-management approaches and technologies supporting chronic conditions, e.g., MCI in senior citizens, is of fundamental relevance. ACTA aims to contribute to this paradigm shift, by supporting autonomy and independence in elderly with MCI, via accessible, effective, and easy-to-use ICT platform. First, we use a low-cost technology to make ACTA accessible to everyone, outside of the advanced research laboratories [78, 41, 32, 31] . Second, we apply a new rehabilitative approach, based on two different but complimentary training strategies, i.e., the nudges and the NFB. They are implemented in ACTA to be fully customized and automatically adapted, in real-time, to the individual's attentional conditions. ACTA is expected to strengthen the individual's decision-making capabilities (via nudge-based training), and to gradually introduce the self-treatment (based on NFB) for the long-term maintenance of his/her cognitive and motor condition. These choices will allow the elderly to benefit of this kind of cognitive and motor training on a daily basis (i.e., a more intense rehabilitation program can be offered), and to be able to access it in a more ecological environment (e.g., in-home, or outdoor, not necessarily in specialized hospitals only). On the other hand, ACTA provides the clinicians, who are in charge of the senior citizens using the system, a highly explainable data visualization module to analyze the physiological data of their patients, all throughout the training. This allows the therapist to eventually adjust the program, or to consult with the patients, if needed.",

Despite their differences, they could also share similar symptoms. This creates a rather complex and heterogeneous scenario that requires new objective and comprehensive evaluations (i.e., of many aspects of the individual's life and habits) and advanced data analytics competences and tools. To this regard, ACTA aims to contribute by measuring, in real-time and in a quantitative (yet objective) way the most relevant individual's neuro-physiological features and by adapting the training, accordingly. Indeed, as discussed in Section III-C, ACTA exploits advanced machine learning (ML) to create a mutual learning between the predictive model of the machine and the user who is performing the training. Thus, ACTA is expected to reduce the variability in the BCI output due to the intra-subject variations, as well as to favour the re-use of the system for other individuals. On the other hand, the twophase protocol of ACTA (nudges, first, and NFB later) is expected to cope with the inter-subject variability and to facilitate the re-use of the system by different users, i.e., producing different brain patterns.",

Unfortunately, signal quality could be critical to ensure an effective training in the framework of ACTA. In this work, we assume that such EEG can provide an SNR high enough to extract attention-related features (as claimed by the vendors). However, in the future, a systematic comparison with research-grade EEG would be useful to validate ACTA [83] .",

Mobile edge computing and fog computing are seeing increasing popularity as they can lead to minimize network latency and ensure real-time clinical feedback [84, 85, 38] .

It will also provide a user-friendly interface to interact with the senior citizens and make them aware of their progresses during the training program. Also, ACTA is easy generalized to support different cognitive or motor training for other patients, who might need different training tasks. In fact, ACTA features a data processing module and an advanced ML engine that could be adapted to new scenarios. In this case, a new training phase is required for the system to learn the users' profiles and adapt the nudges, and neurofeedback, responses to optimize the training outcomes.",

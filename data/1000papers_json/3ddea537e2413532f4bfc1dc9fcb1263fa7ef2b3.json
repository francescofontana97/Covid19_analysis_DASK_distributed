RSH can also occur after anticoagulant therapy, and early recognition of such cases can save patients' life [2] .",

Although the effects on the body by COVID-19 infection are unknown, studies have shown that it can trigger venous thromboembolic events [3] . Vascular injury in the kidneys, liver, and spleen has also been seen in COVID-19 patients [4] . The exact mechanism causing this vascular injury is not yet truly understood, but it has been hypothesized that the process is a distinct one unique to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus [5] . Therefore, according to the \"Anticytokine-Anti-inflammatory Therapies, Coagulopathy Management\" guideline published by the Ministry of Health, Republic of Turkey on 02.11.2020, it is recommended to use enoxaparin 40 mg 2 x 1 subcutaneously in patients with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 40 for prophylaxis [6] .",

Therefore, according to the \"Anti cytokine-Anti-inflammatory Therapies, Coagulopathy Management\" guideline published by the Ministry of Health, Republic of Turkey on 02.11.2020, it is recommended to use enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously every 12 h in nonsevere COVID-19 patients with a BMI of more than 40 for prophylaxis [6] . While prophylactic doses of anticoagulant therapy are recommended for patients who are followed in the service, the use of anticoagulant drugs at therapeutic dose is recommended for patients who are followed up in the ICU [13] [14] [15] . A study from China suggests that in the absence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, 25% of COVID-19 patients developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is higher than the 5%-15% incidence seen in placebo arms of early studies of VTE prevention in medically ill hospitalized patients [16] . In the study of Moores et al., it was identified that thrombotic events in 7.7% of patients admitted with COVID-19, estimated a cumulative rate of 21% [17] . Also, Barnes et al. recommended anticoagulant prophylaxis for patients with COVID-19 when hospitalized [13] .",

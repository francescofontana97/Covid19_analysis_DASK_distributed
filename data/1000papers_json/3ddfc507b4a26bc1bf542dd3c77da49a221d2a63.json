The main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 may act as an effective target for drug development due to the conservation level. Herein, we have employed a rigorous literature review pipeline to enlist 3063 compounds from more than 200 plants from the Asian region. Therefore, the virtual screening procedure helps us to shortlist the total compounds into 19 based on their better binding energy. Moreover, the Prime MM-GBSA procedure screened the compound dataset further where curcumin, gartanin and robinetin had a score of (\u221259.439, \u221252.421 and \u2212 47.544) kcal/mol, respectively. The His41, Met165, required for the target protein inhibition. The molecular dynamics simulation study confirms the docked complex rigidity and stability by exploring root mean square deviations, root mean square f luctuations, solvent accessible surface area, radius of gyration and hydrogen bond analysis from simulation trajectories. The post-molecular dynamics analysis also confirms the interactions of the curcumin, gartanin and robinetin in the similar binding pockets. Our computational drug designing approach may contribute to the development of drugs against SARS-CoV-2.",

Since the appearance of the first confirmed case in late December of 2019 at Wuhan, capital of Central China's Hubei Province [2] , this viral pneumonia has infected 35 659 007 people with 1 044 269 confirmed dead till 7 October 2020 [3] . Due to the pandemic, most of the countries were forced to adopt a lockdown mode along with social distancing and quarantine strategy triggering dilapidated economic fallout and human suffering [4] . This SARS-CoV-2 is a genus of beta (\u03b2)-coronavirus, which enveloped with a single-stranded RNA virus [5] . Six types of coronaviruses are pathogenic in the human body, most of them including, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoVNL63 and HCoV-OC43 are less pathogenic and responsible for causing the common cold, but in China and Saudi Arabia, the severe infectious SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have shown higher pathogenicity in the year of 2002 and 2012. The case fatality rate was relatively higher the SARS (\u223c10%) and MERS (\u223c35%) than COVID-19 (0.2-7.7%) [6] where its basic reproduction number (R0) (\u223c5.7) of COVID-19 [7] is higher compared to the SARS (\u223c2-3) and MERS (<1) [8] . The SARS-CoV-2 genome has 79% similarity with SARS-CoV-1 and 50% with MERS-CoV [9] , which declared a successor of SARS-CoV-1 by the U.S. National Institutes of Health [10] . The genomic RNA of Coronaviruses ranges from 26-32 kb containing a minimum of six open reading frames [8] and two overlapping polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) are encoded by the first ORF (ORF1a/b) of its two-thirds of the genome length [11] .",

The M pro cleaves polypeptide sequence after glutamate residues which makes it an ideal candidate due to its substrate specificity [8] . The polyprotein cleavage sites for M pro in MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also exhibit similar kinds of substrate specificity and recognition [13] . This is a vital step in the interim of viral replication; the enzymes like RdRp-(RNA dependent RNA polymerase) or nsp13 are essential for the replication process, but it cannot fully function without prior photolytic release [8] . These above-mentioned non-structural proteins enjoin the production of sub-genomic RNAs that eventually translated into an envelope, membrane, spike and nucleo-capsid proteins as well as other accessory proteins [11] .",

Domains I and II consist of chymotrypsin (which like double \u03b2barrel fold), whereas domain III (198\u2212303 amino acid residues) is mainly comprised of five antiparallel \u03b1-helices [12] .

To calculate long-range electrostatic interactions, the particle-mesh Ewald method [45] was employed, whereas a cut-off radius of 8 \u00c5 was considered [46] for short-range van der Waals and Coulomb interactions. The cubic cell, which was employed for simulation was 20 \u00c5 bigger than the drug-protein complexes in all cases and a periodic boundary condition was maintained. The system was neutralized by the addition of 0.9% NaCl at 298 k temperature. The initial energy minimization process of the systems was incorporated by the simulated annealing method by applying the steepest gradient algorithms [47] . The simulation was carried out with a time step of 1.25 fs and the simulation trajectory was saved for every 100 ps. Finally, the molecular dynamics simulation was carried out for 50 ns, and trajectories were used to analyze root mean square deviations (RMSD), root mean square fluctuations (RMSF), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), radius of gyration (Rg), and hydrogen bond number of the system [22, 48, 49] .",

The high throughput virtual screening module then filter and 716 phytochemicals were again filtered in SP or standard precision program. The XP or extra precision program was allowed for more accurate screening (Figure 1 ). The glide ligand efficiency score, SP GScore, Glide evdw, Glide ecoul, Glide energy, Glide emodel score were taken into consideration for screening the ligand molecules from the dataset. The lower energy score from these descriptors utilized to rank the top 19 molecules from the dataset. The XP Gscore was found higher in Quercetin as Moreover, for better approximation, the poses of the ligand molecules generated from the XP module was additionally processed with MM-GBSA. Hence, among 19 compounds, only three compounds have been selected by observing the binding energy ( G bind) with the catalytic region of the M pro . Although, quercetin, myrecetin, taxifolin, trans-caftaric acid, luteolin 7 methyl ether exhibit better energy score but they had higher energy score MM-GBSA.

This complex maintained a stable RMSD profile till the rest simulation periods. Also, the M pro protein from SARS-CoV-2 and robinetin complex had a similar RMSD trend till 35 ns and thereafter increased a little bit but these complexes did not over-fluctuate which demonstrates rigid conformation. Therefore, gartanin and M pro complex had a sharp increase in 30-35 ns, followed by a lower trend like the starting phase. Interestingly, all three complexes did not disclose RMSD descriptors over 2.5 \u00c5 which validates the rigid conformation of the drug complexes. From Figure 3 , it was also observed that robinetin complex had a similar Rg profile from 0 to 25 ns and thereafter, decreased Rg descriptor which indicates the tight packaging system of the complex as the Rg of the drug complex indicates the compact nature of the protein. Moreover, the degree of protein folding and unfolding greatly depends on the value of the Rgs. Moreover, gartanin and the M pro complex had lower Rg profile from 0 to 25 ns and a higher rise of Rg was observed from 25 to 45 ns, which indicates loose packaging of the system. The curcumin complexes had a moderate Rg profile compared to the other two complexes, which illustrates the less mobile nature.",

Figure 3 demonstrates that the gartanin complex had a lower SASA profile at the starting phase and thereafter increased the SASA descriptors, which indicate expansion in the protein surface area. Therefore, this complex truncated its volume by a significant degree for the rest of the simulation trajectory. Interestingly, robinetin and curcumin complexes had a similar SASA trend which is higher than gartanin although little fluctuations were observed from 35-40 ns simulation time. On the other hand, the hydrogen bond has a crucial role in contributing stability in drug-protein complex and molecular recognition. All three drug-protein complexes remained stable in the simulation trajectory which indicates the rigidness of the complexes (Figure 3 ). The flexibility among the amino acid residues can be illustrated through the root mean square fluctuation or RMSF profile.

The robinetin and curcumin complex were comparatively more inflexible compared to gartanin as this complex had inflexibility in the middle phase of the simulation. On the other hand, RMSF analysis established that Domain II had strict nature whereas amino acid residues from Domain I and Domain III had more flexibility in the helical and turn region, although almost every residue was fixed. Also, the surface area of these complexes was not altered by surpassing the SASA values too much as their average of curcumin, gartanin and robinetin were 14175.2 \u00c52, 14063.98 \u00c52 and 14161.77 \u00c52, respectively.

Furthermore, binding pose and interactions from the docking study were further evaluated through a molecular dynamics simulation study where multiple descriptors from simulation trajectories confirm their stability. We also found that the catalytic residue of the M pro , Cys145 and His41 binds with the drug molecules and their existence was also confirmed in the post-MD structures. However, toxicity and pharmacological estimation of the drug molecules confirms better absorption and metabolism profile along with no toxicity probabilities.

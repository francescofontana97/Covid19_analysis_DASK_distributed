Furthermore, mobile applications which accompany wearable devices can be used to collect relevant self-reported symptoms and demographic data. This makes consumer devices a valuable tool in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We considered two approaches to assessing COVID-19 -a symptom-based approach, and a physiological signs based technique. Firstly, we trained a Logistic Regression classifier to predict the need for hospitalization of COVID-19 patients given the symptoms experienced, age, sex, and BMI. Secondly, we trained a neural network classifier to predict whether a person is sick on any specific day given respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability data for that day and and for the four preceding days. Data on 1,181 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (active infection, PCR test) were collected from May 21 -July 14, 2020. 11.0% of COVID-19 subjects were asymptomatic, 47.2% of subjects recovered at home by themselves, 33.2% recovered at home with the help of someone else, 8.16% of subjects required hospitalization without ventilation support, and 0.448% required ventilation. Fever was present in 54.8% of subjects. Based on self-reported symptoms alone, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 \u00b1 0.05 for the prediction of the need for hospitalization. Based on physiological signs, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 \u00b1 0.03 for the prediction of illness on a specific day with 4 previous days of history. Respiration rate and heart rate are typically elevated by illness, while heart rate variability is decreased. Measuring these metrics can help in early diagnosis, and in monitoring the progress of the disease.",

The disease caused by this virus typically presents as a lower respiratory infection, though many atypical presentations have been reported. This has caused a major health challenge globally due to the apparent high transmissibility of this virus in a previously unexposed population. Of particular concern is that the primary mechanisms by which the disease is transmitted are still somewhat under debate (e.g., the importance of airborne transmission) 1 , and the potential for infection by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients (see for e.g., the discussion in Oran & Topol 2 ). The disease is highly contagious, with transmission possible 2.3 days prior to the onset of symptoms, and peaking 0.7 days prior to the onset of symptoms according to one model 3 . As a result, a great deal of effort is underway to potentially diagnose COVID-19 early.",

A 1 \u2022 C rise in body temperature can increase heart rate by 8.5 beats per minute on average 4 . Measuring the resting heart rate, or heart rate during sleep can therefore be a useful diagnostic tool. Similarly, the respiration rate is elevated when patients present with a fever 5 . Heart rate variability is the variability in the time between successive heart beats (the time between successive heart beats is called the \"RR interval\"), and is a valuable, non-invasive probe of the autonomic nervous system [6] [7] [8] . Lowered values are indicative of increased mortality 9 , and may provide early diagnosis of infection 10 . A study of heart rate variability in critically ill COVID-19 patients showed that the approximate entropy and the sample entropy were decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to critically ill sepsis patients 11 .",

A significant percentage of its devices are configured to measure heart rate, and the underlying interbeat intervals (RR) that characterize heart rate variability. The Fitbit app provides a convenient user-facing app that can be configured to present user-facing questions, and to reliably capture responses in a secure and scalable way. In this study, active Fitbit users in the USA and Canada were invited to participate in a survey of whether they have experienced COVID-19 or similar infections, whether they had been tested, and to report on symptoms they experienced. They could also optionally provide additional demographic data such as age, sex, body mass index, and relevant background medical information such as underlying conditions such as diabetes, coronary arterial disease, or hypertension. While the researcher hypothesis was that metrics that could be generated from heart rate were likely to be most predictive of infectious disease, we did not restrict the survey to only Fitbit users with heart rate enabled devices (in practice 95% of survey respondents had heart rate enabled devices).",

The data presented here represent the analysis on survey results collected up to July 14, 2020. The survey contained the following questions in relation to COVID-19 and other likely confounding infectious diseases such as influenza, urinary tract infections etc. -a) have you been tested for COVID-19 (with separate sections provided for tests for active infection versus serological tests for previous infection), b) what were the symptoms experienced and the dates of onset and disappearance of the symptoms, c) were you tested for other infectious diseases such as influenza, strep throat etc. Table I shows the overall breakdown of the survey responses as well as providing summary demographic information on the survey respondents. The age distribution of survey respondents was very similar to Fitbit users' overall age distribution. Survey respondents skewed slightly more female than the corresponding figure for the overall general Fitbit population. Table II describes the self-reported major comorbidities of the participants who reported a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, either through a confirmed PCR test or a serological test (we assume that the vast major- ity of tests for active COVID-19 infection were done using PCR-based techniques). Note that participants could also decline to answer this question, so these numbers are only indicative of general trends in the disease population.",

The respiration rate is obtained by fitting a Gaussian model to the spectrum of the interpolated RR intervals as a function of frequency -this relies on the phenomenon of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) to induce a measurable modulation of the RR interval series. In cases where there is no discernible RSA, we do not estimate the respiration rate. The RMSSD is a time domain measurement used to estimate vagally mediated changes 8 . It is computed in 5 minute intervals, and the median value of these individual measurements over the whole night is calculated. The Shannon entropy is a non-linear time domain measurement computed using the histogram of RR intervals over the entire night. The RMSSD and entropy are computed between midnight and 7 am. The sleeping heart rate is estimated from non-REM sleep only. The respiration rate is computed from deep sleep when possible, and from light sleep in the case of insufficient deep sleep.",

Shortness of breath is highly indicative of the need for hospitalization, while sore throat and stomach ache were the least likely.

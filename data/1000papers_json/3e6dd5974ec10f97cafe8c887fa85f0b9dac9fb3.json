The rapid development and deployment of diagnostics that can accurately and quickly identify pathogens as part of epidemic preparedness is needed now for the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO has developed a global research and innovation forum to facilitate, accelerate, and deepen research collaboration among countries and funders. Great progress has been made in the past decade, but access to specimens remains a major barrier for the development and evaluation of needed quality diagnostics. We present a sustainable model for a global network of country-owned biobanks with standardised methods for collection, characterisation, and archiving of specimens and pathogens to facilitate and accelerate diagnostics development and evaluation for COVID-19 and other diseases of epidemic potential. The biobanking network should be run on the guiding principles of transparency, equitable access, ethics, and respect for national laws that support country ownership and sustainability. Adapting the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits, sharing of specimens from national biobanks can be rewarded through mechanisms such as equitable access to diagnostics at negotiated prices. Such networks should be prepared for any pathogen of epidemic potential.",

Within days the sequence of the virus was published to allow scientists from all around the world to develop molecular assays to detect the virus in patients' specimens. 2 This openness and willingness to share data and key information for test development, as John Nkengasong, the Director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pointed out, is in stark contrast to the SARS outbreak when the development and validation of diagnostic tests to confirm cases hampered international efforts to develop evidencebased control strategies. 3 Within days, many protocols for detecting SARSCoV2 were developed and shared, so that laboratories around the world could start testing for this new pathogen. However, scaling up molecular testing is not easy as these assays require sophisticated equipment, welltrained personnel, and cold storage for reagents. In countries with inadequate laboratory infrastructure, testing is centralised at a few sites with specimens being transported from clinics and hospitals all over the country. At some point, some countries are left helpless with few means of controlling a growing epidemic when they face long backlogs for confirming cases or when testing has come to a halt because of a lack of access to reagents or supplies such as swabs. The sole reliance on molecular testing has led to a global competition for test reagents and supplies that brought to the forefront the inequity of access to key lifesaving technologies across lowincome, middle income, and highincome countries.",

Other POC molecular assays are undergoing clinical trials and several of them will soon receive emergency use approval.

Millions of such rapid POC tests are sold each year for HIV and malaria, most of which are based on the principles of immunochromatography, either in a lateral flow or a flowthrough format. Although the expertise to develop these types of rapid POC tests is widely available, the main barrier to the development of a rapid antigen or antibody POC test for a novel pathogen such as SARSCoV2 is the lack of knowledge on the dynamics of the immune response to the infection, such as when different types of antibodies are produced over the course of infection and against which viral proteins. The identification of immuno dominant viral proteins as marker of acute COVID19 infection and host antibodies that can be used as markers of acute and past infection requires access to well characterised patient specimens at different stages of infection, including convalescent blood samples in those who have recovered. Access to these specimens is also important for evaluation of test performance once a test has been developed. Given the rapid spread of COVID19 around the world, accelerating test development and evaluation is an urgent priority. 4, 5 During the Zika virus outbreak, companies had to pay large sums of money to acquire specimens for test development on the black market, often uncertain of the quality of specimen or its characterisation. Furthermore, once WHO declared that the Zika outbreak was no longer a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, funding for test development was quickly diverted elsewhere and the market disappeared overnight. For companies that have devoted substantial time and resources on test development, the opportunity costs are far too high. For the long term, sustainable mechanisms for accelerating diagnostic test development have to be established for diseases of epidemic potential.",

The dengue biobank samples were used for test evaluation. Common proto cols for specimen collection, characterisation, shipping, archiving, and evalu ation were developed. Test kits submitted by companies were sent to the two regional hubs for evaluation using an evaluation panel assembled at each hub.

Generic protocols were used so that each site could adapt to local requirements as needed but maintain the key parameters. Once the evaluation panel composition was developed and approved by the biobank steering group, calls for contributions to the evaluation panel went out to the biobank network and the panel was assembled virtually with specimens from within the network and from laboratories outside the ZikaPLAN network, as needed. Companies with tests for evaluation sent their tests to the sites for evaluation. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in collaboration with the International Diagnostics Centre, functioned as the coordinating body to drive protocol development and panel consensus; furthermore, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine oversaw the network logistics and analysed the results. The decentralised network model for test evaluation was used by UNICEF and the US Agency for International Development for the evaluation of Zika and other arbovirus tests after the Zika virus outbreak, as part of their strategic plan to be better prepared for the next Zika outbreaks. An example of the evaluation process is outlined in figure 1.",

Tests were first evaluated against a small number of specimens that challenge the test specificity, because crossreactivity is a major concern of Zika tests. If the Zika test failed the specificity challenge (<80%), the full evaluation would not be allowed to proceed, hence the term, sudden death. The use of a sudden death panel conserved precious resources, saved time, and expedited the evaluation process. The full evaluation was done across multiple sites, representing geographical regions and target populations. Each Zika test was evaluated in sites representing at least two geographical regions. Results were analysed at each site and then in aggregate, providing a regional and global perspective for the use case. The data ultimately belonged to the site, but each site had agreed to share their results within the network. To be fully transparent, results were also shared with manu facturers and they were given the opportunity to review, ask questions, and provide additional input, as needed. One final report was generated for dissemination and for guiding UNICEF procurement for countries.",

The ZikaPLAN virtual biobank network model offers a faster and sustainable solution. Investments are also crucially needed through public private partnerships to build core country capacities and improve infra structures. The Africa CDC was launched in January 2016 to support and work with all African countries to improve surveillance, emergency response, and prevention of infectious diseases; this work is important for reacting quickly and in cooperation as microbes can potentially sweep across the globe in hours and result in the death of many people. Nkengasong noted that there were major improvements in China's response to COVID19 compared with their response to SARS, which was possible thanks to massive efforts of national and international coordination. 3 At the laboratory training workshops in Africa in February, 2020, lead laboratory scientists from more than 30 countries were trained not only in molecular methods to detect COVID19 but also in providing realtime molecular testing data to an online platform established at the Institut Pasteur Dakar (IPD). 12 The need for setting up a biobank of wellcharacterised specimens to facilitate and accelerate the development and evaluation of antigen and serology tests for COVID19 was explained to the laboratories at the work shops. The Africa CDC Laboratory Working Group reviewed the lessons learnt and decided to adopt the decentralised network model for the Africa CDC COVID19 biobank. The ZikaPLAN biobanking guiding principles, govern ance, criteria for recruitment of biobank sites, mechanism for specimen collection, characterisation and archiving, and access of specimens for test development and evaluation, as described above, were reviewed by Africa CDC and adapted for COVID19 ( figure 2 ). In addition, the Africa CDC decided to add facilitation of research as a third function of its biobank. The research done includes sequencing of positive specimens for genomic surveillance. This procedure is currently done at IPD and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa but will soon be expanded to six other sites across the continent. This research enables Africa CDC to have a realtime surveillance system for tracking the emergence of COVID19 on the continent and a virtual biobanking network for COVID19 and other infectious ",

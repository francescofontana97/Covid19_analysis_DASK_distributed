It was on March 11 th 2020, when World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as the first pandemic of this millennium. As the number of cases in India is rising exponentially, healthcare workers (HCWs) of other specialties are expected to be on the frontlines and support the health system. 1 In their battle against the raging COVID-19 pandemic, the use of medical masks and respirators as personal protective equipment is pivotal to reducing the level of biological hazard to which healthcare workers are exposed during the outbreak of this highly diffusible pathogen. 2 HCWs employed on the frontline are at maximum risk of catching this deadly infection. It becomes imperative to educate the frontline workers regarding the proper donning and doffing techniques for personal protective equipment (PPE) for controlling the disease spread.",

Some of the most enduring images of COVID-19 have been those of the HCWs with red marks and bruising on the face after wearing PPE. Wearing PPE for 8-10 hours at a stretch in this scorching heat of India leaves sweat soaked HCWs which can lead to dermatitis, acne, miliaria, fungal infections, and folliculitis. Eating, drinking or even urinating is out of the question during duty hours which may even stretch to 12 hours in areas facing massive outbreaks, forcing HCWs to wear adult diapers to preserve their PPE.

Use of fat soluble disinfectants such as 75% alcohol or chlorine-based disinfectants can develop occupational skin disease (ie, allergic contact dermatitis) due to disruption of the skin barrier leading to desquamation and ultimately hand eczema complicated with itching and bleeding. Hyperhidrosis/ hyperhidration of the hands can develop after long use of gloves and increases the risk of allergic contact dermatitis. An odds ratio of 2.17 for occupational hand dermatitis was reported. 7 Even in other parts of the world, HCWs have witnessed numerous cutaneous manifestations due to N95 masks, goggles and face shields, they squeeze and rub the cheek, forehead and nasal bridge leading to indentations, ecchymosis, maceration, abrasion and erosion. 8 Delayed pressure urticaria has also been reported, nose is the most common site of skin damage (83.1%) among first-line HCWs. 7 According to studies, HCWs are at increased risk of moral injury and mental health problems while allocating scanty resources to equally needy patients which should be managed promptly. 9 As the frontline warriors are going through terrible physical and mental breakdown, especially after wearing these PPEs kits on COVID duty, the society must deeply acknowledge all the hard work put in by the HCWs during these challenging times of the pandemic.",

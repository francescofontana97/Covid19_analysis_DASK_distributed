This review aimed to scope the literature to identify what is known about the frequency and duration of e-bike use, their impact on travel behaviour, the purposes for which e-bikes are used and factors associated with e-bike use. In addition, the review aimed to identify gaps in the literature and highlight future research priorities. Methods: A scoping review of published and unpublished literature in any language. Relevant articles were identified through searching six databases, two grey literature platforms and reference lists. Searches were conducted until August 2019. Data were extracted using a standardised extraction form and descriptive and narrative results are provided. Results: Seventy-six studies met the inclusion criteria. The volume of research has increased since 2017 and primarily examines personal e-bike use, as opposed to e-bike share/rental schemes or organizational e-bike initiatives. The use of e-bikes increased the frequency and duration of cycling compared to conventional cycling and may help overcome barriers associated with conventional cycling. The uptake in e-cycling largely substitutes for conventional cycling or private car journeys, though the degree of substitution depends on the primary transport mode prior to e-bike acquisition. E-bikes are primarily used for utilitarian reasons, though older adults also engage in recreational e-cycling. Research priorities include quantitatively examining e-bike use, their impact on overall transport behaviour and identifying determinants of e-cycling to inform intervention and policy. Conclusions: This review suggests that the personal use of e-bikes is associated with a reduction in motorized vehicle use, which has potential positive impacts on the environment and health. The impacts of e-bike share schemes and workplace initiatives are less well understood. Evidence describing the purposes for which e-bikes are used, and the factors associated with usage, are useful to inform e-cycling promotion policy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Travel is an essential part of everyday life for most people.

In the current review there are contradictory results of how the speed associated with e-cycling impacts safety perceptions. Specifically, in some studies participants reported feeling safer riding an e-bike than a conventional bike due to an ability to keep up with traffic and avoid potential accidents (MacArthur and Kobel, 2017; Edge et al., 2018; Dill and Rose, 2012) while in other studies participants reported that the e-bikes speed created dangerous situations, therefore, negatively impacting safety perceptions (Jones et al., 2016; Gordon, 2012; Popovich et al., 2014; Plazier et al., 2018; Haustein and M\u00f8ller, 2016b) .

Interviews with e-bike users in USA showed that e-cyclists were concerned that motor vehicles underestimated the speed of the e-bike due to an inability to distinguish the e-bike from a conventional bike (Popovich et al., 2014) , this is supported by video analysis by Dozza et al. (2016) who suggest that while e-bikes look like conventional bicycles their increased speed means drivers have less time to see them or react to them.

In the current review e-bike owners tended to report fewer safety concerns than non-users (Simsekoglu and Kl\u00f6ckner, 2019b) . Furthermore, countries with low levels of cycling such as Canada, the UK and, USA had more frequent reporting of barriers associated with safety due to poor infrastructure and riding with traffic than countries with high levels of cycling (Gordon, 2012; Haustein and M\u00f8ller, 2016a; Jones et al., 2016; Leger et al., 2019; MacArthur et al., 2018; Popovich et al., 2014) . It is therefore important that potential e-bike users are provided with training on how to safely ride and manoeuvre an e-bike in a low traffic environment to help build confidence and to reduce the likelihood of traffic incidents.

It is possible that women are encouraged to purchase an e-bike due to the anticipated benefits but are more fearful to ride it due to the lack of cycling infrastructure. In countries with high levels of cycling and good cycling infrastructure, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, the mode share of cycling is higher in women than men (Fishman et al., 2015; Haustein et al., 2020; Aldred et al., 2016) .

E-bike use findings suggest that e-bikes are used more frequently for commuting to work compared to leisure use. However, the distance of commuting journeys is less than during leisure rides (Winslott Hiselius and Svensson, 2017; Haustein and M\u00f8ller, 2016a) . As such, the total distance ridden across a week maybe similar between leisure riders and commuters, but the pattern of use is different which may vary by life stage. For example, Hendriksen (2008) reported that individuals > 65years, mostly leisure riders, rode on average 25.3 km per week, while commuters rode 39.4 km per week. Interestingly, there were no differences in the purpose of e-bike use between countries with high or low levels of cycling.

Individuals unaccustomed to e-cycling will likely display different patterns of use and possess different attitudes and experiences of e- cycling Limited research in this area. This is an important area of research as 36% of all car journeys made in England in 2017 were for commuting or business purposes and light commercial vehicles were the faster growing motor vehicle in the UK in the last 25 years Limited research in this area. It is important to ascertain whether the provision of these, more expensive products, is a valuable strategy to increase bike use </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>11\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors would like to thank Emma La Fontaine and Caroline Linnemann for their assistance in translating documents.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Acknowledgements"}, {"text": "Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jth.2020.100910.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Appendix A.

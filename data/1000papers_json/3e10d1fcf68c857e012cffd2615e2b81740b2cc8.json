            "text": "The novel coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 pandemic has caused an unprecedented civic, economic, and political disruption worldwide. This pandemic has stressed healthcare systems and departments across the globe. The health department's role is to educate the public effectively and in a timely fashion. Additionally, health departments plan for and respond to public health emergencies of this scale, as well as develop mitigation strategies for future pandemics. Public health administration also needs to communicate factual information about the risk, hazards, as well as effective prevention and mitigation strategies. This can correct misconceptions, clarify ambiguities and may help counter the spread of harmful misinformation that can cause public outrage and anxiety. 1 The widespread availability of the internet and mobilesmart devices has created rapid communication opportunities through social media platforms. Approximately 42% of the world population (3.2 billion) regularly uses social media. 2 A World Health Organization (WHO) 3 survey noted that in nearly 80% of the responding member nations, health care organizations use social media to promote health messages. Importantly, 80% of the member states indicated that individuals and communities use social media primarily to learn about health issues, and such platforms have become a major mode of health information. This mode of information consumption can shape public perception and understanding of risk as well subsequent response. 4 However, misinformation about medical information can also rapidly disseminate through these channels and can promote behaviors and attitudes detrimental to a population's response to a pandemic. 5, 6 Realizing this challenge, the WHO has acknowledged the critical role of social media for risk communication and encourages the transparent, open, and 2-way use of social media platforms to disseminate and communicate accurate information with the public.",

However, we have limited information about the public's engagement with the state Public Health Departments via social media. The COVID-19 pandemic provided the impetus to investigate this engagement. We hypothesized that a larger segment of the U.S. public will turn to State Public Health Departments' social media sites for reliable medical information during the pandemic compared with the pre-pandemic rates of social media engagement. To test this hypothesis, we tracked the social media following of the fifty U.S. Public Health Departments during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we used panel data analysis to evaluate how and if any state-level characteristics and public health governance were associated with the changes in common social media platform followings.",

These dates were chosen based on the timeframe when the COVID-19 pandemic reached national attention and when individuals started seeking more information regarding COVID-19 and its spread. State-level demographics were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau. 7 The Center for Disease Control and Prevention 8 was utilized to collect information regarding the Governance of each State's Health Department. Health rankings were collected from \"America's Health Rankings\" 2019 Annual report from the United Health Foundation, 9 which provides rankings of each of the 50 States based on 35 measures of health determinants and health outcomes.

Health rank is operationalized as a continuous variable (1 best to 50 worst). 9 Similarly, both Higher Education and Pre-K-12 rankings are operationalized as continuous variables (1 best to 50 worst). 10 Finally, racial distribution includes the percentages of White, Black, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, Other, and Multiple in each State.

Panel analysis provides the opportunity to describe change at different cross-sections over time based on multiple unit observations. Our panel is of short duration and was balanced (ie, no missing data). Since our dependent variables are counts, we opted to utilize negative binomial and Poisson regression models with random effects adjusting for population averages. For each Social Media platform, overdispersion was assessed, and when present, negative binomial analysis was utilized. In each panel regression model, the total population of the State was used as an exposure variable. There are 6 models: Overall, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Due to the small sample sizes associated with Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn, we included continuous variables first and excluded region and governance variables due to limited variability. Adjusted incident rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported.",

Low overall population density may be responsible for differences in states such as Alaska, the Dakotas, and Wyoming. However, a relatively low number of followers in densely populated states of California, Texas, New York, and Florida were unexpected ( Figure 3A) . Additionally, there were higher increases in followers in the Northeast and Midwest than in the South. These differences may reflect the evolution of the pandemic as it progressed through the early phase. The correlation of social media followers and State Education Ranking was complex. Worse Higher Education rankings were associated with fewer followers, while worse K-12 ranking were associated with more followers. These results suggest that education differences have some bearing on what social platforms individuals use to receive health information. Additionally, we noted lower following and lesser increases over time in states with better Health Rank for Instagram. While not statistically significant, a similar trend was noted for Facebook and Twitter. These results point toward either an actual or perceived decreased need for using social media platforms in states with better Health Rankings, which may indicate better communication services, better public health literacy, or potentially an under reliance or underinvestment in these platforms.",

First, we recognize that the \"Follower\" status is one of the several variables indicating the level of individual engagement with social media. The number of followers may not represent true population-level data and may include individual or organizational accounts. Further, we used absolute change in followers, which could bias results toward more populous States. Second, there are multiple sources of information available to the public. Our analysis does not prove that overall public engagement in seeking health-related information is low, nor that public health messaging is not being disseminated through a third-party. Third, we did not analyze the content of the social media exchange or interaction. While this is important at an individual State level to understand the needs or concerns of the local population, it was beyond the scope of our original intent and did not alter the health policy significance of our findings. Finally, the raw number of followers does not provide specific information regarding how messaging from the Public Health Departments were utilized or how well or often the Public Health Departments communicated on each platform. Future research should seek to better understand the nuances of how Public Health Departments are providing needed messaging, as well as how individuals are consuming that information. Mixed methods studies of different stakeholders are needed to understand the public and the health departments' perspectives and to identify facilitators and barriers to the effectiveness of communicating public health information via social media.

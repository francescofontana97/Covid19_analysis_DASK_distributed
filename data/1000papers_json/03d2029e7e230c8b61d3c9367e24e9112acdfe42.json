Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2435 employees from the enterprises located in Deqing (low-risk epidemic area) and Taizhou (high-risk epidemic area) of East China in March 2020. An online questionnaire covered information on sociodemographic and lifestyle factors as well as knowledge, attitude, behavior and experience about COVID-19. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were applied to assess depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Logistic regression model was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for depression and anxiety symptoms associated with risk factors. Results The participants were aged 36.3 \u00b1 9.2 years on average, and nearly half of them were female. Overall, the prevalence of depression, anxiety and both were 19.4%, 12.3% and 9.8%, and decreased with age. After adjustment for covariates, 16 or more years of education, being a white-collar worker or working in the high-risk epidemic area were significantly associated with increased risks of both depression and anxiety, in contract regular physical exercise was associated with decreased risks of both mental disorders.",

Compared to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the COVID-19 epidemic caused greater anxiety and panic in China, and there was more than one third (35%) of the Chinese adult population who had psychological distress in early February 2020 [6] [7] [8] [9] . Most regions in China took various community-based measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 [10] . People had been asked to stay home or self-quarantined since middle February 2020, and they might live in areas with low, moderate, or high risk for COVID-19 in China [11] . The COVID-19 epidemic could have a profound mental impact, but the mental health status of employees with a different epidemic experience who return to work had not been well investigated [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and anxiety and their influencing factors among returning workers with a different experience of the COVID-19 epidemic in East China.",

Those with a completion time of fewer than 2 min or missing important information such as age and sex, were excluded.

In the earlier epidemic stage of COVID-19, one study showed a prevalence of 48.3% for depression and 53.3% for anxiety among the general Chinese adult population [24] . Another study reported that the prevalence of moderate or severe depression and anxiety symptoms were 16.5% and 28.8%, which were substantially higher than our findings (2.9% and 1.6%, respectively) [25] . The reduction of depression and anxiety prevalence was similar, and it is likely because the COVID-19 epidemic was largely under control in the study areas. Furthermore, there might be other reasons for the study discrepancies such as different study populations and measures of mental health. Compared with SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic is more severe, so is the mental health in the general population [26, 27] . Intervention measures should be taken to improve mental health before and after the pandemic. Previous studies documented that people living in severely infected districts were more likely to have impaired mental wellbeing [24, [28] [29] [30] . Compared with Deqing (lowrisk area), Taizhou (high-risk area) had a higher prevalence of both depression (21.0% vs. 18.4%) and anxiety symptoms (14.4% vs.10.9%), and the differences were not likely due to confounding effects. In addition, white-collar workers were significantly more likely to have depression and anxiety, which is consistent with the findings from a previous study, in which higher risks for both mental conditions were found in the high-risk epidemic area [31] . It suggested that whitecollar workers should be paid more attention to their mental health, especially in the high-risk epidemic area.",

First, this study targeted bigger local enterprises that provided more secure jobs compared with smaller local enterprises and, therefore, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms might be relatively low. Second, the cross-sectional study design provided no evidence for causal relationships between influencing factors and depression or anxiety symptoms. Third, the scales we used did not provide accurate psychological diagnoses of mental disorders. Fourth, both the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 are basic questionnaires for screening out general depression and anxiety disorders, and more specific questionnaires are needed for the diagnosis of mental disorders Deqing is defined as low-risk area, and Taizhou as high-risk area. M mean, SD standard deviation. p value < 0.05 means the difference is statistically significant a 12 missing data b 477 missing data in the future. Fifth, the questionnaire information was collected via an anonymous online survey, and the quality of such information has not been well investigated. In addition, some unmeasured confounding factors such as previous psychological experience might have some impact on the observed associations. Despite these limitations, this study was the first cross-sectional survey on the prevalence of depression and anxiety among returning workers in two study sites with a different epidemic risk for COVID-19, and the response rate was as high as 99%. The survey was anonymous since people might be sensitive to some questions related to their mental health. The online survey was an efficient method to gather information during the pandemic of COVID-19. ",

However, the ethical and legal boundaries of deploying digital tools for disease surveillance and control purposes are unclear, and a rapidly evolving debate has emerged globally around the promises and risks of mobilising digital tools for public health. To help scientists and policy makers to navigate technological and ethical uncertainty, we present a typology of the primary digital public health applications that are in use. These include proximity and contact tracing, symptom monitoring, quarantine control, and flow modelling. For each, we discuss context-specific risks, cross-sectional issues, and ethical concerns. Finally, recognising the need for practical guidance, we propose a navigation aid for policy makers and other decision makers for the ethical development and use of digital public health tools.",

Across countries and institutions, public health experts and researchers from diverse fields such as epidemiology, virology, evolutionary biology, and social science have pointed out the broad range of insights that can be gained by collecting, analysing, and sharing data from diverse digital sources. These sources include data from telephone towers, mobile phone apps, Bluetooth connections, surveillance video, social media feeds, smart thermometers, credit card records, wearables, and several other devices. In parallel, Apple and Google, two of the world's largest information technology companies, have unprecedentedly banded together to create application programming interfaces that enable an interoperability between Android and iOS devices using apps from public health authorities, to offer a broader Bluetooth-based exposure notification platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms. 1 Although the promise of big data analysis has been widely acknowledged, and governments and researchers around the globe are rushing to unlock its potential, notable technical limitations have also surfaced. These limitations include the accuracy, granularity, and quality of data that vary greatly across the different data sources; the adequacy of computation safeguards; and the interoperability issues and security risks. Simultaneously, notable ethical and legal risks and concerns have been identified that accompany digital disease surveillance and prediction. 2 Civil rights organisations, data protection authorities, and emerging scholars have highlighted the risk of increased digital surveillance after the pandemic. 3 These groups have emphasised the need to meet baseline conditions such as lawfulness, necessity, and proportionality in data processing, and the need for social justice and fairness to take precedence despite the urgency of this crisis.",

However, interdisciplinary research has shown the value of context in managing the societal, legal, and ethical risks of data processing for pandemics that stretch beyond the issue of privacy.

Rather than a focus on so-called solutionist or instrumentalist approaches (where the focus is on the benefit that the technology itself brings to public health management) to digital public health technologies, we instead focus on public health outcomes, as well as the ethical principles guiding these outcomes. 8 We offer a typology of the main applications that are in use, and we discuss their respective features, including both application-specific and context-specific risks, crosssectional issues, and ethical concerns. Finally, we propose a navigation aid for policy makers, recommending steps that should be taken to mitigate risks by engaging in a robust risk-benefit analysis. This aid is derived from the translation of ethical principles from public health and data ethics, and builds upon process-based risk assessment and governance frame works. Further, this aid can be calibrated to each typological domain to guide different technological platforms and at various phases of the deployment of digital public health technology.",

This typology is based on four main categorical variables: key actors, data types, data source, and model of consent. The concept measured by the typology (called the overarching concept in typological research) is the public health function of a technology; not its physical realisation at the hardware or software level. As a result, this multidimensional model can be put in use to categorise not only tools that have already been deployed but also future and emerging technologies. Our typology identifies four main functional categories of digital public health technologies for pandemic management: proximity and contact tracing, symptom monitoring, quarantine control, and flow modelling.",

            "text": "Proximity tracing tools measure the spatial proximity between users to track their interaction. Proximity tracing, sometimes also in conjunction with patient reports or other non-digital sources, can identify when users are exposed to an individual that is positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For example, the Singaporean application TraceTogether uses Bluetooth connections to log other telephones nearby and alerts those who have been close to an individual who is SARS-CoV-2 positive. When users have shared proximal space with someone who is SARS-CoV-2 positive, they are encouraged to self-isolate. 10 Symptom checkers are tools of syndromic surveillance that collect, analyse, interpret, and disseminate healthrelated data. 11 Using these tools, users report their symptoms, obtain a diagnosis, and possibly get a triage decision. Accordingly, symptom checkers promise a cost-effective way of enabling rapidly scalable epidemio logical data collection and analysis, which is crucial for a data-driven response to this public health challenge. 12 Further, the value of digital symptom checkers resides in their assistance in triaging large international and disperse populations of patients that seek health care. An example of a symptom checker is the CoronaMadrid symptom checking application. Using this technology, the Spanish Government collaborated with citizens, health profes sionals, and the private sector to monitor the disease, respond quickly, allocate resources, and generally minimise or control outbreaks. Another mobile application called the COVID-19 Symptom Tracker garnered more than 2\u00b78 million users in the UK and the USA, collecting data on risk factors, symptoms, clinical outcomes, and geographical hot spots to inform a data-driven response to this public health challenge. 12 Quarantine compliance tools involve the real-time monitoring of whether individuals who are symptomatic or non-symptomatic are complying with quarantine restrictions. Public health legislation includes requirements for infected or potentially infected individuals to be isolated from others, so they do not spread the disease further. These technologies can provide a mechanism of ensuring that infected individuals are isolated from other individuals. Examples include Taiwan's Electronic Fence application that tracks quarantined overseas arrivals using mobile phone data. 13 Flow modelling tools, otherwise known as mobility reports, quantify and track people's movements in specified geographical regions. Typically, these tools rely on aggregated, anonymised sets of data from the geographical location of users. Flow modelling can provide insight into the effectiveness of response policies (eg, physical distancing or forced quarantine) aimed at combating COVID-19. 14 This typology allows us to structure these technologies in a four-dimensional model. First, we include the key actors involved in the design and implementation of these technologies (government agencies, academia, private companies, and citizens). Secondly, we assess the different data types being collected, using the classification offered by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (non-identifying personal data, and sensitive personal data). Thirdly, our typology includes the different origins of these data, including Internet Protocol addresses, call site data, Global Positioning System data, Bluetooth, and third-party data. Finally, this typology considers the different types of consent required to collect data, including opt-in consent, opt-out consent, and mandatory use. This four-dimensional model allows us to compare the ethical implications of different types of technological approaches to pandemic management, as shown in figure 1 . Note, there might be variations of these technologies and overlaps in approaches because of the rapid proliferation and evolution of national, international, and private actor initiatives in this domain.",

Proximity tracing tools, in contrast, typically require the user to download an application from an application store and to create a user account. Early assessments in countries like India, Norway, and Singapore have shown that low uptake hampers efforts to use this technology. 15",

Similar to any other health-care intervention such as medicines or lockdown measures, the rollout of digital public health tools to combat the pandemic requires a reasonable expectation of public benefit (ethical principle of beneficence) and clear prospective evidence that such benefit will outweigh the risks (non-maleficence). Possible benefits associated with these technologies include forecasting new outbreaks, 20 promptly alerting and isolating exposed individuals and thereby preventing or reducing new infections, improving quarantine measures, improving the efficiency of social care and vaccine development, and improving how information is communicated to citizens. 21 The realisation of these benefits might depend on technology-specific factors. For example, simulation data suggest that the beneficial impact of contact tracing apps largely depends on the user uptake rates being more than 50% of the population, 22 which have not yet been achieved by any existing technology. Symptom checkers, in contrast, appear more rapidly scalable but might be affected by data quality issues since they are typically based on self-reported data. 12 In addition, as emphasised earlier, the efficiency might depend on many non-technical factors, including the availability of testing, socioeconomic affordances (eg, social safety nets for people affected by the lockdowns) and public trust. 23, 24 In general terms, in order to ensure the public benefit of a digital public health technology, developers and deployers must make choices towards a clearly favourable risk-benefit ratio throughout the different phases of the decision making process as outlined in figure 2.",

By contrast, it heightens the responsibility of public health actors to uphold rigorous and evidencebased practices. 26 Furthermore, the use of digital tools involves inevitable compromise. Even when digital public health technologies can demonstrably improve the rapidity of pandemic response 27 they might nonetheless be affected by issues of data quality and integrity that, in turn, can have an outsized effect on large-scale predictive models. 28 Uncertainty about scientific efficacy can make assessing the proportionality and risk of proposed measures more challenging. 29 Subsequently, measures based on such models might be disproportionate, This sunburst diagram presents how the six ethical principles raise ethical and legal issues when considered in relation to digital public health technologies against COVID-19. As shown by the intersecting circles at the centre, these principles apply equally to symptom checkers, proximity and contact tracing, quarantine compliance, and flow modelling.",

Digital tools for measuring relative spatial proximity among phone users are, all other things being equal, less privacy-invasive than personal contact tracing or quarantine enforcement apps. Likewise, tools using aggregate mobile phone tower data are, on average, less privacy-invasive compared with tools based on Global Positioning System data and sensor tracking for individual users. 31 The use of more granular and specific types of data can increase the risk of downstream reidentification of individuals or groups. Further, with the vast amount of data being gathered, public health agencies and application developers must prevent downstream reidentification through data linkage. 32 It is also vital to understand that privacy risks can change and accumulate over time, which highlights the need for strong legislative protection. In the EU, several regulatory instruments offer varying amounts of safeguards for the right to privacy and data protection. These include the General Data Protection Regulation, the e-Privacy Directive and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Likewise, at the Council of Europe level, the European Charter of Human Rights guarantees the right to a socalled private life. However, these regulations set forth the circumstances where these rights can be abridged, including during a public health crisis, and several EU institutions have provided relevant guidance recently. 33 Further, any digital public health technologies abridging these rights must be proportionate to the aims sought. In other words, this abridgment must lead to a faster restoration of other rights and freedoms that were suspended because of lockdown policies (eg, freedom of movement and freedom of assembly). 34",

The most obvious form of violation of personal autonomy is the mandatory use of digital public health technologies. For example, India's home ministry has required that all local workers, public or private, use a government-backed COVID-19 tracking application called Aarogya Setu. 35 However, even when governments do not make the use of such technologies mandatory, it is conceivable that organisations or employers might require their use for particular activities or access to services. In such cases, people will be left with no real option and their autonomy will be undermined. Less explicit threats to autonomy are raised by smart phone applications that include permissions to collect data beyond the stated purpose of the application. These data handling practices might strip people of their ability to consent to being tracked or having their information shared, depending on their purpose, mode of data collection, and data source. For example, in order to work properly, proximity tracking apps based on Bluetooth need to require or encourage users to keep their Bluetooth turned on at all times, creating additional risks. These approaches to data collection must respect autonomy, such as by ensuring strategies are in place to update the user regularly. Finally, mandating quarantine apps or technologies for infectious individuals or their contacts raises the most serious questions of justifiable coercion. On the one hand, the effectiveness of quarantine might be undermined if it remains voluntary rather than mandatory. On the other hand, some government activity (such as the Polish government creating shadow profiles for returning citizens as part of a quarantine app) might constitute an overreach on autonomy. 36",

Specifically, these technologies can be used to collect large amounts of data about entire populations. These data can include race, ethnic group, gender, political affiliation, and socioeconomic status, which in turn can be used to stratify populations by demographics. Many of these demographics are sensitive and not necessarily related to a person's health, and might lead to stigmatisation of particular ethnic or socioeconomic groups. 21 Further, information such as racial demographics might lead to a surge in discrimination, as seen by a rise in attacks on people of southeast Asian descent in the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, stratifying populations on these grounds might reinforce existing divides that leave particular groups more vulnerable to the pandemic. Therefore, safeguards must exist for any digital public health technologies to prevent \"the predictable from becoming exploitable\". 32 Conversely, data collection should not be limited to epidemiological factors, but also capture socio-economic differences that are known to drive disparities in infection rates. Such efforts, especially when taking place in lowtrust environments, need to be supple men ted by robust safeguards, including analytical capacities to contextualise the data in order to avoid further stigmatisation of underserved populations and provide evidence-base for action against persistent health inequalities. 37",

Likewise, there was an outcry after the Hungarian government led by Viktor Orban instituted powers by decree to fight the COVID-19 pandemic without an expiration date. 40 Therefore, heightened surveillance empowered by digital public health technologies should not continue after the COVID-19 pandemic has ended.

In 2019, two-thirds of the world's population did not own smart phone technology, and one-third did not own any mobile phone. Smart phone ownership disparities are particularly noticeable in emerging economies. For instance, in India, the world's second most populous country accounting for more than 17% of the global population, only 24% of adults report owning a smart phone. 42 Even in advanced economies with high smart phone ownership rates, not all age cohorts are catching up with digital tools. In 2018, most citizens of Japan, Italy, and Canada older than 50 years did not own a smart phone. 42 In addition, not all smart phones have the technology built in that is necessary to support certain functions, such as proximal location sensing. 43 Any digital public health technology solution that relies on mobile phones excludes those without access to these technologies for geographical, economic, or demographic reasons, as well as a broad range of already marginalised groups. If not complemented with non-digital strategies, the risk of exclusion of marginalised groups might exacerbate health inequalities. When addressing these challenges, researchers and policy makers might face conflicts between different ethical values. In public health ethics, there is a continuing tension between public benefit and individual rights and civil liberties. 44 This tension mirrors an underlying conflict between personal autonomy (ie, protecting personal freedom) and beneficence (ie, maximising public benefit) and has already emerged in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as public-benefit-motivated lockdown measures have caused a temporary restriction to individual freedoms in the name of the public good. These include freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, and entrepreneurial freedom. 45 Digital public health technologies generate a similar tension with rights and freedoms, especially the rights to privacy and informational self-determination. Since these technologies require high uptake and massive and ubiquitous data availability to be effective, their successful deployment for the public good might conflict with the protection of private information of users (eg, their serological status, health records, geo location, proximity, voice records, pedometrics and other activity data, data upload, and download transmission, etc). Risks for individual rights are also raised by a temporal factornamely the urgent need to mitigate the pandemic. Software, application program ming inter faces, and other digital tools require time to be developed in a privacypreserving manner, and to be adequately validated via rigorous beta testing and pen testing. Given the immense time pressures under which global actors are operating, it is reasonable to expect that some of them will roll out tools without the necessary validation, and hence they won't be able to prevent miscon figurations, software bugs, and other errors that can jeopardise individual and collective privacy. To offset this risk of infringing individual rights, there must be a framework for deciding what public benefit is appropriate. In this regard, Laurie 46 suggests the test of reasonable benefit in the context of data sharing for pandemic response. Assessing what is reasonable for a digital public health technology depends on two main variables: scientific evidence and risk assessment. Pro spective scientific evidence is necessary to predict and quantify the expected benefit of a new digital public health technology, and should be corroborated with the continuous monitoring of efficiency during the rollout phase. Risk impact assessments, including privacy impact assessment, are necessary to predict and quantify the potential risks, including risks for individual rights. Deployers of digital health technology have a moral responsibility to conform to the highest standards of scientific evidence and risk assessment, and show that the magnitude and probability of public benefit outweigh the magnitude and probability of risk at the individual level. In the absence of clear public health benefit, even minor restrictions of individual rights might result in being disproportional, and hence are unjustified. Whether one principle should be prioritised over another as a design choice is a matter that must be decided on a case by case basis and using established methods to resolve ethical conflicts or dilemmas such as risk-benefit assess ment and reflective equilibrium. For example, among populations susceptible to COVID-19 (such as people older than 70), there might be lower computer literacy. Therefore, the beneficence principle might take priority over autonomy in justifying developing simplified digital public health technologies.",

The technical, organisational, legal, ethical, public health, and other challenges that need to be managed when using digital tools in response to COVID-19 are complex and require an interdisciplinary team. It is necessary to ensure a team from diverse backgrounds and ethnicity, with diverse experiences, and high integrity, that participate in communities of practice. 51 Secondly, this phase requires the establishment of guiding ethical principles. In addition to ensuring compliance with fundamental rights and applicable legal norms, establishing clarity with respect to value commitments, red lines, and guiding principles will help to navigate tensions or conflicts between values when embracing digital technology against the fight of COVID-19. The set of principles (beneficence, justice, nonmaleficence, privacy, solidarity, and autonomy) discussed in this article can serve as a reference point. [52] [53] [54] [55] Planning phase",

            "text": "There are three inherent limitations to our conclusions. The first is the technical limitations of the different types of applications described in this typology. The urgent nature of any pandemic means developers are under substantial time pressure to develop new software applications in response to changing evidence. However, a countervailing consideration is the reliability of both novel technologies in the time of a pandemic and the sources of the data. Specifically, complex technology not only takes a long time to develop, but is prone to failure, which in turn can undermine public trust and use of that technology. 59 Therefore, the technology and implemen tation strategies underlying digital public health technologies also contain notable ethical considerations. However, balancing which technical choices are pref erable from an ethical perspective in granular detail is beyond the scope of this Health Policy paper. The second is digital public health technologies that might exist outside the typology that we describe in this paper. Specifically, our typology and ethical recom mendations have been developed using software applications that are currently in existence. Therefore, the typology described in this article and the corresponding analyses are likely to evolve as new digital public health technologies designed for COVID-19 are emerging on an almost daily basis. Nonetheless, the functionalist character of our typology provides sufficient agility and flexibility to adapt to future and emerging technologies based on different software or hardware architectures compared with those available to date. Likewise, we do not address the use of artificial intelligence for pandemic management, as our Health Policy paper is focused on public health goals rather than technology types. Accordingly, we do not consider the large number of artificial intelligence ethics and governance principles that exist. 60 Further, we consider digital surveillance and contact tracing as part of a broader strategy that is conditioned on large-scale testing, universal access to health care, and adequate societal safety nets. The absence of these conditions results in the use of these digital tools being misguided and irresponsible, given the associated risks. Other technologies might be used to achieve different public health goals, such as mental health counselling for those in isolation and mutual aid for susceptible individuals. Although these technologies might not be used in disease diagnosis, they carry their own ethical considerations that should be considered by developers, public health agencies, and governments. 61 The third limitation pertains to managing competing ethical goals.",

This study surveyed community college students (N = 356) about their confidence in completing learning related tasks before and after the shift, access to technologies used in in remote learning, and disruptions that impacted their learning. Results indicated notable declines in confidence across all demographics with significant changes in those age 18-21and for those without prior online course experience. Technology use for remote courses was primarily laptops and smartphones. Students reported the most significant changes to work-life balance came through employment changes and mental health issues. Instructional changes were both positive and negative in workload organization, course delivery, communication and technology. Institutions can use this study's findings to enact contingency planning, expand online and blended course options, refine academic and social support, and allocate resources to mental health.",

In most cases of institutional response to various demands, higher education is most often the laggard (Pincus et al. 2017 ). However, COVID-19 forced an expeditious transition from in-person and blended instruction to fully remote delivery (Kim 2020) . The pace of the transition saw historic institutional resource commitment in several peripheral areas, such as the acquisition of synchronous web conferencing technology (such as ZOOM), loaning of hardware and software licenses for faculty and students and an exponential increase in learning management system usage (LMS) (Flaherty 2020) . While the stress of this quick transition was certainly felt by faculty, those with experience and training in multiple teaching modalities (e.g. online and blended classrooms) more effectively re-tooled courses.",

Missing are the perceptions of students. Once the retooling of courses was accomplished and the classes were 'live,' students were left to complete them in this new remote learning format (Grajek 2020) . This transition from face-toface to remote learning should be examined from the students' perspective. Prior to COVID-19, research found that many students reported taking in-person or blended/mixed classes because they prefer these over online courses (Jaggars 2014; Kemp and Grieve 2014; Malarkodi et al. 2018) . Since remote delivery of existing classes was mandatory, understanding student perceptions of the transition can benefit practitioners as it will enable them to better plan for the possibilities of using remote instruction in a more robust manner regardless of whether the approach becomes normalized.",

Effectively, an instructor would deliver their course on the same schedule as if it were offered in a traditional face-toface or blended format and use the institution's learning management system for assignment submission, quizzes/exams and other course materials. Although remote instruction as the delivery of synchronous real-time interaction to many students is not new (White et al. 2010) , the literature contains few traces of research on the effects of a rapid transition to remote learning. Still as a system, education is not limited to the physical contexts of a traditional setting on a college campus (Frick 2020) . To that end, we situate this study by researching the conversion of face-to-face courses to other delivery methods (i.e. online, blended, etc.), studies of self-efficacy and confidence, the use of technology in eLearning courses and the impact of household or peripheral situations that affect how students complete coursework.",

            "text": "Numerous examples in the literature detail the transition of inperson courses to online and other modalities which could help to understand what occurred during the transition to remote instruction. The advent of the internet led to educators to design courses online which effectively replaced other forms of distance education (Carr-Chelman and Duchastel 2001), such as correspondence or video courses, by using the power of connecting users across any distance (Conceicao 2006) . Even so, many challenges exist in converting a face-to-face course to an online in the middle of the semester. No 'one size fits all' approach exists (Gillet-Swan 2017). Much work has been directed towards the quality of these converted courses and the impact on students (Pentina and Neely 2007; Xu and Jaggars 2013) . Educators are continuously comparing face-to-face and online instruction, particularly, how delivery method may affect students taking the course. From a student outcome perspective, Xu and Jaggars (2013) found that students enrolled in face-to-face courses had both higher persistence and outcome measures than those enrolled in online courses. Bettinger et al. (2017) found a similar result when examining performance based on grade point average (GPA) and persistence. Uniquely, the Bettinger et al. (2017) study described all aspects of course delivery as identical between online and inperson courses, including the professor, class materials and class size. The Bettinger et al. (2017) study more closely resembles what happened during rapid conversion in the spring semester. On might assume that remote courses may see reduced performance as well, though the purpose of the present study is not focused on success but rather perceptions and confidence.",

Bandura (1986) argues that self-efficacy is a primary factor in determining the success of an individual. Those with higher self-efficacy espouse higher confidence and experience a lower likelihood of failure. According to Bandura (1997) , four factors affect self-efficacy: (1) mastery experiencesindicating repeated effort produces higher confidence, (2) vicarious experiences where a mentor guides navigation of a challenge, (3) verbal persuasionconsisting of being told success is possible and (4) physiological stateswhere completing a challenging task leads to positive emotions (and vice versa). These factors lay the groundwork for many instruments measuring self-efficacy, particularly as it relates to teaching and learning (Chen et al. 2001; Gaumer Erickson et al. 2018; Schwarzer and Jerusalem 1995; Sherer et al. 1982) .

Studies with an online course focus tend to examine self-efficacy and its relationship to a specific aspect of learning, such as internet self-efficacy (Kuo et al. 2014) , use of computers in learning (Lim 2001) or selfefficacy as a standalone construct (Artino 2007) . The result of studies that connect computer self-efficacy and performance often conflict. For example, Jan (2015) found a positive relationship between self-efficacy in using a computer and overall academic efficacy. In contrast, Puzziferro (2008) studied 815 community college students and found no correlation between performance and self-efficacy with technology. Lee and Witta (2001) found self-efficacy with course technologies did not predict later performance, although selfefficacy and course satisfaction did improve over the term. The conflicting findings of these studies could be attributed to any number of factors, such as student educational experience, the ways in which different institutions design and deliver online courses or the faculty-student relationship in the course.",

Causes included relocation and physiological effects from the earthquake which led to PTSD through symptoms such as, \"poor concentration, depression, anxiety and insomnia\" (p. 63). Each factor affected the ability to focus on academic work. Certainly, the severity of the event effects the degree of stress and anxiety (McCarthy and Butler 2003) and the effects of PTSD can linger long after the event occurred (Sparks 2017) . That said, the response of the college following a traumatic event matters. A study of campus preparedness following the 1999 Clarksville, Tennessee tornado highlighted the importance of addressing mental health needs of students immediately following the disaster (Shepherd and Sheu 2014) .

Our survey focused on students and their perceptions of how the transition to remote effected their coursework. Faculty in high enrollment social science and humanities courses (e.g. sociology, geography, history, English) received an invitation to distribute the online survey to students in their remote sections which had initially started as face-to-face or hybrid/blended classes. Instructors had the option of whether or not to distribute the survey; all responses were anonymous and not tied to particular sections. For that reason, the response rate is not quantifiable.

With two exceptions (taking class notes on instruction and participating in class discussions), males reported a slightly smaller drop in confidence post COVID than female participant. The differences in the racial and age demographics were more marked and reported in Table 3 . A comparison of ages found that generally students from ages 18-21 saw larger decreases in confidence measures than those in the other age ranges. Students who were over 22 years of age had a minimal change in confidence in successfully completing tasks. Logically, older students tend to have more life experience and often have learned how to persevere with challenging circumstances, like COVID. These older students have learned to navigate work-life balance as they often have fulltime employment, childcare considerations or other more significant life issues that have provided practice on tackling challenges and overcoming adversity more so than younger students. We do not suggest such younger students may not face similar hurdles to their older peers; however, the length of time spent facing challenges is far less, thus suggesting more experience and ability to adapt as a vicarious experience (Bandura 1986 (Bandura , 1997 . We also examined differences among participants identifying as part of an ethnic/racial group. Among the students responding to the survey, only a few students identified as Hispanic (7) and Asian (11) (See Table 1 ).

To better understand the range of responses, their comments were coded and grouped into three general categories. First, student reported changes in their work-life balance which was coded as environmental issues. While some students experienced the loss of employment, others were deemed 'essential workers' which led to more hours or a change to their schedule.

Respondents identifying as African American/Black only were twice as likely to report a preference for face-to-face classes compared to those identifying as White only (17% compared with 8.8%); more likely to report having difficulties managing work (17% compared with 7.6%); and less likely to have work issues (4.3% compared to 9.6%).

In fact, elements of online courses can provide more structure in face-to-face courses that could benefit student's access course materials with consistency throughout a semester.

Certainly, colleges and universities should ensure staff are prepared to address issues arising during crises to ensure they can meet student needs. What we did find are students who reported issues related to social isolationa facet certainly connected to mental health. Students missed in-person interaction in classes and group meetings, tutoring sessions, and visits to the library.

While there have been local or regional events that have caused sharp changes in delivery, higher education has not faced a critical global situation like the COVID-19 pandemic (Polkoff et al. 2020 ). The present study captures some early information from a student perspective despite certain limitations which we discuss here. One limitation was the abbreviated timeframe required to develop and administer a survey before the end of the semester. To quickly create a survey, we created an instrument based on a previous confidence survey (Bandura 2006) . If we had more time, we might have been supplemented with questions from a psychometric analysis standpoint to ensure validity and reliability. A second limitation was the sample size which is small for a community college with a population of 25,000. Early on, we decided to target students in introductory, general education classes in the social sciences and humanities where the delivery was face-to-face or blended. We did this to reach students who did not previously have an experience with online classes. Still, it would have been helpful to survey a larger sample. Although we had enough responses to compare students with online experience and those without, it would have been helpful to reach more students distinguished by race/ethnicity and gender. A final limitation relates to the timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study captures the early stages of the pandemic in the spring of 2020. Since this time, institutions of higher education have continued to shift their responses based on their local and national situation during the ongoing pandemic. Further research may help to understand how students are impacted by these changes in higher education. In particular, a focus on mental health would likely be informative as the results of this study were limited in terms of student mental health needs.",

Students faced all sorts of challenges as they balanced a new learning environment with many adjustments to work, family and home life.

The key is to continue working towards understanding the differing circumstances of students to help them be successful during these unexpected (and expected) disruptions to learning.

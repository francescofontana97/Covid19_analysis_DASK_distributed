In addition, neighborhoods with lower rates of poverty and those with fewer residents over 70 have fewer cases.

In addition, the results are greater evidence of the impact of systemic issues on health, which require a long-term strategy for redress.",

However, state and even county level aggregations mask heterogeneity inherent over such large areas, while individual characteristics can overlook structural effects.",

Therefore, the spatial structure of a place can also have an effect on any modeled neighborhood scale socioeconomic relationship. 8 This applies to both measured and unmeasured characteristics of a neighborhood. Spatial models account for spatial endogeneity by identifying spatial relationships in a weight matrix, which is used to address omitted variables and spatial error. 10, 11 Omitted variables, such as can be expected when modeling using a limited set of explanatory variables, can exacerbate the bias arising from spatial dependence 12 ; A more detailed discussion is provided by Anselin, 8 Anselin et al . 11 and Conway et al . 9 among others.

However, the test statistics are not very different in Table 3 (757.19 versus 549.15 for the lag and error models, respectively). The spatial lag model finds fewer differences from the OLS results. Here, there is a positive and significant relationship between population density and the use of public transit. Unlike the spatial error mode, the percentage of residents working in a different county is significant and positive. However, the share of poverty continues to have a significant and negative relationship with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Finally, we find a consistently significant relationship between the percentage of Blacks and Latinx in a neighborhood and the number of COVID-19 cases per capita.",

Race, poverty, and age have the most consistent effect on the size of COVID-19 outbreaks. In particular, the share of African Americans or Latinx in a neighborhood is a significant and large positive predictor for the size of the outbreak per capita. These results indicate these communities have been hardest hit by the novel coronavirus, which supports most contemporary reporting on the problem and thus add to the mounting evidence of how the virus has disproportionately impacted minorities and their communities. However, with a neighborhood level analysis we are unable to identify the exact causes of the findings and several mechanisms may be at play. There are several possible explanations for why minorities, and African Americans in particular, would be more likely to live in areas with higher counts. We have been able to account for their potential greater reliance on public transit and living in higher housing density, higher rates of poverty, and lack of access to health insurance, all of which may explain the higher counts of COVID-19. Thus, these factors do not fully explain the differences. It is possible that such communities have not followed government guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus, but van Holm et al ., 13 showed nearly zero significant differences between the races with regard to trips taken, social distancing, hand washing or other associated behaviors.",

The percentage of college graduates and poverty percentage, despite being negatively correlated, both predict a negative relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases in a census tract (although education is only significant in the spatial error model). That leads to the question of why higher socioeconomic status would both predict more and fewer cases? That finding likely reflects that the two measures are capturing different aspects of socioeconomic status. Individuals with a high socioeconomic status were likely able to protect themselves and more strictly social distance, reducing their hazard with the virus. For those with low socioeconomic status, such distancing would be difficult, but they may be less likely to get tested, thus reducing the case count.",

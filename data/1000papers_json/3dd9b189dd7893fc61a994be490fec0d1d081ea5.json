In molecular docking analyses, PolyPs interacted with several conserved angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) amino acids. We thus tested PolyPs for functional interactions in vitro in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6, Caco2 and human primary nasal epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence, qPCR, direct RNA sequencing, FISH and Immunoblotting were used to determine virus loads and transcription levels of genomic(g)RNAs and sub-genomic(sg)RNAs. We show that PolyP120 binds to ACE2 and enhances its proteasomal degradation. PolyP120 shows steric hindrance of the genomic Sars-CoV-2-RNA/RdRP complex, to impair synthesis of positive-sense gRNAs, viral subgenomic transcripts and structural proteins needed for viral replication. Thus, PolyP120 impairs infection and replication of Korean and European (containing non-synonymous variants) SARS-CoV-2 strains. As PolyPs have no toxic activities, we envision their use as a nebulised formula for oropharyngeal delivery to prevent infections of SARS-CoV-2 and during early phases of antiviral therapy.",

Due to the high ACE2 expression levels in nasal epithelial cells (24) , we used human primary cells obtained from nasal brushings of healthy subjects (Fig. S2D) . These were treated with increasing concentrations of PolyP120. Immunoblotting demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in ACE2 protein levels in these cells after 24 h treatments with PolyP120 (4.2-112 \u03bcM) (Fig.   1C ). In Vero cells, the addition of 37.5 \u03bcM PolyP120 also showed a time-dependent ACE2 down-regulation (Fig. 1D) . Of interest, the decrease in ACE2 protein levels was dependent on the number of phosphates in the PolyPs (Fig. 1E) . Thus, to reduce the levels of ACE2 in Vero cells, they needed to be treated with PolyPs with >8 phosphate residues. Furthermore, longchain PolyPs treatment showed greater accumulation of ACE2 upon addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, compared to the vehicle controls (Fig. 1F) , thus suggesting that the PolyPs-mediated downregulation of ACE2 occurs via proteasome. To further validate that PolyPs affect the ubiquitin-proteasome system, PolyP120 was shown not only to increase the levels of ACE2 in presence of MG-132 ( Fig. 1G ) but also to reduce its levels upon addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 1H) . These data are further confirmed using transfection of an HA-ubiquitin plasmid construct in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1I,   Fig. S2E ).",

The first mechanism involves timeand dose-dependent proteasome-mediated degradation of ACE2 protein in the presence of long chain length PolyPs. This appears to be due to the binding of the PolyPs to ACE2, which should be mainly mediated by four amino-acid residues of ACE2 that are also conserved across different species: Arg514, His 401, His 378 and Arg393. This is of importance to avoid further spillover. We also note the role of PolyPs as a source of Pi to increase the pool of ATP available to enhance the ubiquitin-proteasome system (29) .",

The PolyPs appear to bind to viral RdRp from SARS-CoV-2, mainly through seven of its amino-acid residues located within the RdRp RNA-binding site. PolyP120 appears to decrease the expression of the main SARS-CoV-2 viral genes through this mechanism. Of importance, the transcription of the main viral sgRNAs is also impaired confirming their inhibitory actions on RdRp transcription. This inhibition also occurs in the The various concentrations of PolyP120 tested here are also shown not to have any toxic effects, as seen by monitoring of the caspase 3 enzymatic activation in human primary nasal epithelial cells. However, the highest concentration of PolyP120 tested (i.e., 112 \u03bcM) blocked proliferation of these primary cells. This anti-proliferative effect might be due to the inhibition of the MAP-kinase cascade (via ERK), which has previously been reported for inorganic PolyPs (33).",

            "text": ", in COVID-19 infections, microcapillary clotting in the lung generates acute pulmonary embolisms, which impairs O 2 acquisition by the lungs, thus resulting in insufficient respiratory function. Of importance, low molecular weight heparin sulphate given to the patients reduces their pain, improves their clinical status, reduces their IL-6 release, and stabilises their oxygen exchange (35). At this time it is not clear if PolyP can suppress the complement protein via the terminal pathway (15) and enhance the clotting formation. For these reasons, cautions should be taken to treat late stage disease patients with PolyP. Comorbidity, asymptomatic and symptomatic patients can use different immune systems to fight SAR-CoV-2, where memory CD4+ T-cells have been shown to have a role (36). The use of PolyPs can enhance the immunological memory, including T-cell activation, and this can be monitored in vivo in further clinical trials. These will be issues for future efforts. Patients with COVID-19 suffer from respiratory failure. So new drugs formulated as aerosols should represent a promising therapeutic approach. Interestingly, we also show here that the efficacy of PolyPs is maintained when they are nebulised for their delivery to the cells, as the PolyP120 still showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in infected Vero cells. Thus, we envision the aerosol delivery of PolyP120, for the treatment of patients with respiratory failure. The final formulation will be discussed elsewhere. Finally, these data show 'preventive' effects of the long chain length PolyPs against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this regard, the panel on Food Additives and Flavourings has already provided information about the safety of phosphates as food additives (i.e., E450-452) (37). To date, among the drugs tested on COVID-19 patients, the safety and antiviral activity of Remdesivir (GS-5734) is emerging in two completed phase 3 clinical trials (NCT04292899, NCT04292730). Assuming no toxicity of PolyP120, we hypothesize its rapid use in clinics in early phase of COVID-19 disease (2) alone or in combination with Remdesivir. Thus, the use of PolyP120 against infections with SARS-CoV-2 or other new expected virus can be envisioned for the near future.

These experiments were performed in a B3 authorised laboratory. Therapeutic treatment Vero cells (4 \u00d710 5 ) were plated in six-well plates for the viral infection with SarsCov2 viral particles, which were obtained from a frozen swab from Italian or Korean patients positive for COVID-19. Non-infected cells were used as the negative infection control. After 24 h, the infected cells were treated with PolyPs of different chain lengths (up to PolyP189) or PolyP120 at different concentrations (9.38, 18.75, 37.5 \u03bcM). Vehicle-treated cells were used as the negative treatment control. After 24 h of PolyPs treatments (i.e., 48 h after infection), the Vero cells were lysed and their RNA was extracted. These experiments were performed in a BLS3 authorised laboratory.Nebulised PolyP120 treatmentVero cells (6 \u00d710 5 ) were plated in a T25 flask. The PolyP120 (37.5 \u03bcM) was dissolved in 2 mL water solution and nebulised for 2 min using a nebuliser system (mesh nebulizer; YM -252; input: 5 V/1 A; oscillation frequency, 110 kHz; atomised particles, <5 \u03bcM; condensation rate, 1 mL/min). Following removal of the medium from the flask, the nebulised PolyP120 was directed into the flask. The medium was then replaced after the nebulising of the PolyP120. PolyP120 in the cells was detected by immunofluorescence using DAPI. These 20 Vero cells treated with nebulised PolyP120 were then infected with the SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.Real-time RT assays: N1-3 detection RNA samples were extracted with TRIzol RNA Isolation Reagent (#15596018; Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer instructions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using 'quanty COVID-19' kits (Ref. RT-25; Clonit; US Food and Drug Administration 'in-vitro diagnostic' (IVD) approved). These kits allow specific quantitative detection of the N1, N2 and N3 fragments (from the Sars-CoV-2 N gene), using differentially labelled target probes. These runs were performed on a PCR machine (CFX96; BioRad) under the following conditions: 25 \u00b0C for 2 min; 50 \u00b0C for 15 min; 95 \u00b0C for 2 min; 95 \u00b0C for 3 s; 55 \u00b0C for 30 s (\u00d745 cycles). RdRp and E detection RNA samples were extracted with TRIzol RNA Isolation Reagent (#15596018; Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer instructions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using 'RealQquality RQ-2019-nCoV' kits (Ab Analitica; IVD approved) for detection of the RdRp and E genes (from the SarsCov2 N gene). These runs were performed on a PCR machine (CFX96; BioRad) under the following conditions: 48 \u00b0C for 10 min; 95 \u00b0C for 10 min; 95 \u00b0C for 15 s; 60 \u00b0C for 1 min (\u00d745 cycles). ACE2, N1, RdRp, E, S, sgM, sgE, sgN, sgS detection RNA samples were extracted with TRIzol RNA Isolation Reagent (#15596018; Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer instructions. Reverse transcriptionwas carried out using '5\u00d7 All-in-one RT Mastermix' (#g486; ABM), following the manufacturer instructions. The cDNA preparation was through the cycling method, as follows: incubation of the complete reaction mix at 25 \u00b0C for 5 min; at 42 \u00b0C for 30 min; at 85 \u00b0C for 5 min; and hold at 4 \u00b0C. The reverse transcription products (cDNA) were amplified by quantitative real-time PCR using a real-time PCR system (7900; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The relative expression of the target genes was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394Ct method. All of the data are presented as means \u00b1standard error of two to three replicates.

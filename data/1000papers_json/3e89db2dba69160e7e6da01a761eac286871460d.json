Characterization of these patients may inform post-hospitalization care. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who returned to the emergency department (ED) or required readmission within 14 days of discharge. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of SARS-COV-2positive patients with index hospitalization between February 27 and April 12, 2020, with \u2265 14-day follow-up. Significance was defined as P < 0.05 after multiplying P by 125 study-wide comparisons. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 discharged alive from five New York City hospitals. MAIN MEASURES: Readmission or return to ED following discharge. RESULTS: Of 2864 discharged patients, 103 (3.6%) returned for emergency care after a median of 4.5 days, with 56 requiring inpatient readmission. The most common reason for return was respiratory distress (50%). Compared with patients who did not return, there were higher proportions of COPD (6.8% vs 2.9%) and hypertension (36% vs 22.1%) among those who returned. Patients who returned also had a shorter median length of stay (LOS) during index hospitalization (4.5 [2.9,9. 1] vs 6.7 [3.5, 11.5] days; P adjusted = 0.006), and were less likely to have required intensive care on index hospitalization (5.8% vs 19%; P adjusted = 0.001). A trend towards association between absence of in-hospital treatment-dose anticoagulation on index admission and return to hospital was also observed (20.9% vs 30.9%, P adjusted = 0.06). On readmission, rates of intensive care and death were 5.8% and 3.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Return to hospital after admission for COVID-19 was infrequent within 14 days of discharge. The most common cause for return was respiratory distress. Patients who returned more likely had COPD and hypertension, shorter LOS on index-hospitalization, and lower rates of in-hospital treatment-dose anticoagulation.

A COVID-19related hospital admission included any inpatient encounter with detected SARS-CoV-2 from an order within the first 48 h of the encounter, including time spent in the emergency department, or within 48 h of an antecedent lab diagnosis-only visit in an outpatient setting. Patients were excluded if they were still hospitalized, discharged < 14 days prior to the data freeze on April 26th, 2020, or died during the index admission. Detailed chart review revealed return to the hospital within 12 h (N = 28) was primarily due to a lack of care coordination (e.g., primary caretaker not at home). All of these patients were also discharged the day following admission, reflecting important readmissions that highlight critical areas for quality improvement interventions.

These features included demographics, key vitals, and laboratory measurements on time of discharge from index hospitalization and readmission, disease diagnoses, comorbidities, procedures during hospitalization (including intubation and non-invasive O 2 oxygen support), ICU course, and outcomes (death or hospital discharge). Selection, culling, and cleanup of these variables were performed through exhaustive manual inspection by two physicians (AL and GN) and two residents (internal medicine, anesthesiology). Comorbidities were extracted using International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9/10 billing codes for atrial fibrillation (AF), asthma, coronary artery disease (CAD), cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes (DM), heart failure (HF), and hypertension (HTN). In-hospital anticoagulants included treatment-dose oral anticoagulation (warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban), treatment dose low molecular weight heparin (bemiparin, certoparin, dalteparin, enoxaparin, nadroparin, parnaparin, reviparin, tinzaparin), and intravenous heparin. While body mass index (BMI) may be bucketed into categorical representations (e.g., low, normal, high), we kept BMI as a continuous variable because such a reduction in its representation may inject bias into statistical inference and lower the confidence of interpreting its resulting trends. Due to discrepancies in how labs were named in different hospitals, a comprehensive and statistical review of all labs by field name was conducted by the aforementioned team of clinicians to ensure that there was a direct mapping between all sites. Additionally, many labs represented a single component (e.g., sodium), but were acquired from either an arterial blood gas (ABG), venous blood gas (VBG), or basic metabolic panel (BMP). Based on the utility of these lab values in clinical practice and the similarity between their statistical distributions, labs derived from a VBG or BMP were collapsed into a single category (i.e., \"SODIUM\"), and arterial labs were not incorporated as features in these analyses. The lab closest to discharge, by time of result, in the set of all lab order names that were combined into a single lab category, was chosen as the representative lab value for that category. Finally, lab data below the 0.5th and above the 99.5th percentiles were removed to avoid inclusion of outliers that could represent incorrect documentation or measurement error. Labs with > 80% missing data were subsequently excluded, resulting in an a priori set of 125 variables for comparison of the primary endpoint.

Though the percentage of patients returning to hospital within 14 days was small, we made several important observations. First, patients who returned generally presented within 5 days of discharge, with only half of these requiring hospital readmission. Age, sex, and race/ethnicity were not different in patients returning to the hospital compared with those patients who did not return within 14 days; however, there was a higher prevalence of hypertension and COPD. Second, respiratory distress, accounting for half of all symptoms on return, was the most common cause for returning to the hospital. Finally, returning patients had a shorter LOS, had lower frequencies of ICU care, and were less likely to have been on therapeutic anticoagulation on index hospitalization compared with patients that did not return to the hospital. These findings may offer implications for the post-discharge care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and if verified, could inform resource allocation. 3, 4 Notably, patients returned to hospital relatively early at a median of 4.5 days after discharge from their index hospitalization. While the lack of association between age and return to hospital was surprising, the finding that COPD was more common among returning patients was consistent with the observation that respiratory distress was the most common cause for return. Though lower BMI could serve as a marker for and has been associated with worse health outcomes in other disease states, the distributions of BMI between those returning to the hospital and those who did not were relatively similar (Supplementary Figure 1) with a low difference in means; therefore, further work is needed to unravel the association between BMI and outcomes in COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1163, "end": 1165, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1167, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1789, "end": 1798, "text": "Figure 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Interestingly we note that patients who returned to the hospital had lower LOS on index hospitalization. Despite administrative prioritization to reduce LOS and readmissions, studies across a variety of disease states have suggested these two outcomes may be inversely related. [5] [6] [7] Reducing LOS during the COVID-19 pandemic has also been emphasized for the purposes of preserving resources and limiting exposure. Further, we observed returning patients were less likely to have required ICU stay during the index hospitalization. ICU stay serves as a marker of illness severity and thereby may caution practitioners to ensure clinical stability prior to discharge. 8 Whether continued in-hospital observation translates into longer LOS for improvement in respiratory status impacts readmission status and exposure risk warrants further study. 9,10 These patients also had trends of higher heart rate, respiration rate, elevated WBCs, and higher platelet counts when returning to the hospital as compared with discharge, which may be consistent with signs of the continuation of the underlying inflammatory process that may not have subsided fully prior to discharge. We also observed a trend towards the association between treatment-dose anticoagulation use and return to hospital. There is increasing speculation that COVID-19 is a prothrombotic disease 11, 12 and as such, the impact of treatmentdose anticoagulation on readmission and other outcomes is of special interest. However, this trend may be confounded by the institution of systemic anticoagulation policies at our institution for SARS-COV-2-positive patients mid-way throughout the time period of this study, which suggests the need for a more rigorous clinical trial design to validate this observed trend.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 281, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 282, "end": 285, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 286, "end": 289, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 673, "end": 674, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1367, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1370, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Finally, though comparative data on COVID-19 return to hospital does not yet exist, readmissions for other diseases provide context for our observed representation rate (3.6%).

Teasing apart these contributions will require further work dissecting geo-demographic, temporal, and historical trends in both our hospital system and others.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 344, "end": 346, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Several limitations of this study warrant mention. First, small sample sizes and missing data restricted statistical power and prevented multivariable analysis to adequately control for non-normal distributions and feature collinearities. 15 Larger sample sizes may allow the development of such multivariable models to address potentially confounding factors and are actively being pursued. 16 The lack of multivariate adjustment was mitigated in our comparison of discharge and re-presentation data, because patients served as their own controls for these hypothesis tests. Another limitation is that height was occasionally recorded from previous hospital encounters in patient charts, so height and BMI were missing in 11% of patients from the database implementation for the index COVID+ hospitalizations. To maintain proper data hygiene, we avoided looking beyond this initial patient encounter to recover these heights. Missing information was also encountered for a subset of anticoagulation medication data, which were obtained with an alternate procurement procedure that resulted in data harmonization issues for 14% of patients. Second, although the MSHS reflects a large and diverse cohort, clinical management varies across hospitals and continues to evolve. Additionally, many of these discharges were in the earlier period of the COVID-19 pandemic when hospital capacity was strained. Thus, generalizability may be limited due to a possible temporal bias, necessitating extension of current studies to longer time periods. Third, readmission over a 30-day horizon may permit comparative analyses with readmission rates for other diseases to inform impact on systemslevel operations. The number of readmissions may have been underreported given the retrospective design of this study due to presentation to hospitals outside of the Mount Sinai Health system that could not be tracked via EHR and at-home patient deaths that prevented a return to the hospital. 17 In summary, among patients discharged following admission for COVID-19, the rate of early return to hospital was relatively low (3.6%), with only half requiring readmission. The most common cause for return to hospital was respiratory distress. Returning patients were more likely to have a history of COPD and hypertension and have had shorter length of stay and lower frequency of therapeutic anticoagulation use during their index hospitalization. When larger sample sizes become available, the conceptual framework and preliminary trends in this study can help guide future research in understanding determinants of safe discharge and appropriate in-hospital treatment for preventing readmission and death following a COVID-19 hospitalization.

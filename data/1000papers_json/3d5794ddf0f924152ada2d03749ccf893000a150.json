This review aims to: a) Gather and discuss in detail the available literature on the ophthalmologic manifestations of VitB12 to provide a pooled knowledge base and access to information for clinical guidance as well as further prospective studies. b) Discuss essential elements of reported cases, including the presentation and type of optic nerve damage, reversibility of the symptoms, treatments used, and the role of drugs other than vitamin replacement.",

Search results were initially reviewed by title and abstract. Subsequently, articles were selected for more detailed review and included in the study if deemed relevant. Inclusion criteria were any case report or case series discussing ophthalmic manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency, and exclusion criteria included reports discussing non-ophthalmic manifestations of B12 deficiency or articles written in a language other than English. Statistical analysis was done for differences in outcome in terms of age, vitamin B12 levels, and gender. Fisher's Exact test, T-tests were applied, and a P-value <0.05 cutoff was set as our alpha. SPSS V26 was used for the analysis. A favorable outcome, resolved, was defined as the cases who showed complete or partial improvement, and unresolved were those who lost sight completely or showed no improvement.

Among the cases, 8 are females, whereas 16 are males. The median age at presentation is 31 years. Ophthalmological involvement was the initial presentation in twenty-one patients (87.5%), while three patients (12.5%) were known cases of VitB12 deficiency and developed ophthalmological symptoms in due course. The most common presenting complaint was a gradual bilateral decrease in vision. Intramuscular VitB12 replacement followed by oral supplementation was given to twenty-two patients (91.6%), one patient received an only oral replacement, and one patient did not receive VitB12 replacement. Bilateral optic atrophy was the most common diagnosis, seen in 16 patients (66.6%), whereas optic neuritis was diagnosed in two patients. Intravenous steroids were given to three patients (12.5%) in addition to B 12 replacement. A complete resolution of the eye symptoms was seen in six patients (25%), eight patients (33.3%) had partial improvement, seven patients (29%) did not improve, and one patient (4%) progressed to complete blindness. One patient had an improvement of vision in one eye only, and one patient was lost to follow-up. Mean Vit B12 levels were 89.9+-79.1 and 134.5 +-44.1 in resolved vs. (versus) unresolved cases. The mean age of the resolved cases was 33 +-19.7 years vs. 30.1+-17.4 years. None of the differences were statistically significant. 3 out of 7 females showed improvement compared with 13 out of 17 of males, and the difference remained insignificant.",

The antinuclear antibody was negative, ruling out a possibility of vasculitis with optic nerve involvement. Lumbar puncture was done on day two, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was sent for a detailed analysis. The cell count, protein, and glucose were within normal limits, and the CSF was negative for viral, bacterial, or fungal meningitis and tuberculosis. Additionally, there were no oligoclonal bands. The patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g for five days. However, the steroids did not improve the vision. At this point, a visual evoked response (VER) was performed, which showed a delayed response, hence reinforcing the presence of optic neuritis. As the patient was a vegetarian, serum VitB12 level was sent, which was low (80.5 pmol/L, normal range: 145-596 pmol/L). The patient was given intramuscular cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) (1000 mcg daily for seven days) on day 6 of admission and then started on oral CNCbl (1000 mcg once daily). The patient reported mild improvement in vision in the following days.",

He was discharged with a follow-up in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic for a repeat ophthalmologic examination.

The patient was counseled to continue vitamin replacement and was provided with a prescription for a corrective lens. He was followed up once again after 30 days of the first follow-up visit, but this time it was through telecommunication due to COVID-19 restrictions. He stated no further improvement in his vision than his last visit and reported no pain on eye movements. He was compliant with oral Vitamin B 12. The patient could not be followed up further as he lost his job due to the impact of COVID-19 on the local business market and traveled back to his home country.",

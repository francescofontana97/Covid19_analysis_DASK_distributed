CRP is the most commonly researched acutephase reactant in infection and noninfectious inflammation. There is some evidence to suggest antenatal CRP levels are associated with pregnancy-related complications [29] , mental disorders in offspring [30] , infant birthweight [31] , and neonatal CRP levels [32] . Although CRP cannot be transmitted to the fetus through the maternal-fetal interface, maternal inflammation can affect the fetal immune state including immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 434, "end": 438, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 471, "end": 475, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 497, "end": 501, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 528, "end": 532, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 727, "end": 731, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Research implications"}, {"text": "In the 5 COVID-19-infected neonates in our study (Table 4 ), we found their clinical manifestations were very different from those of infected adults and even children [19] . Neonates had almost no symptoms, and it was difficult to judge the changes in white blood cells and lymphocytes because of the differing number of days since birth. In terms of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests in throat and anal swab samples, there may have been sampling errors and false negative or false positive results. As for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG, only 4 cases were tested in this study due to late arrival of the testing platform, which may become a powerful method for identifying the infections in the future. When comparing all the various diagnostic examinations, the chest CT images appear to be the most important for a diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 among neonates. The typical radiographic findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in those 5 infants were predominately manifested as focal or diffuse GGOs located in the peripheral regions, which were distinguishable from bacterial infection but nonspecific from other virus pneumonia, such as influenza A. After treatment, all neonates showed improvement on chest X-ray or CT images. However, in 1 neonate (Patient 18), we found the densities of previous existing lung lesions increased with interlobular septal thickening, suggested that interstitial fibrosis had developed and may influence pulmonary function in the future. As previously reported [34] , CT scan is more sensitive than X-ray film in detecting pulmonary lesions which are usually overlapped by the shadow of the heart or hidden behind posterior region of the diaphragms. Considering the safety of ionizing and the need of avoid wasting a medical resource, it is urgent to develop an effective standard to screen infants and children for COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 172, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1510, "end": 1514, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 49, "end": 57, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Research implications"}, {"text": "Notably, although 12 of the 13 other hospitalized neonates presented radiological features for pneumonia through X-ray or CT, only 1 neonate had an occasional cough, and none of them had any of the usual symptoms associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It seems that neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 had a significantly increased risk for pneumonialike damage within 6 days of birth. Generally, the incidence rate of neonatal pneumonia is <1% among full-term infants and approximately 10% in preterm infants [35, 36] . However, the neonates in this study had no specific symptoms of pneumonia, so no microbiological test had been implemented except for SARS-CoV-2. The increased radiological features for pneumonia may be due to false negative of SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, which has a 30% false negative rate [37] . For example, Patient 12 had a typical CT feature for COVID-19 infection, but her throat and anal swabs were all negative. As such, it is possible that some of these 12 neonates had a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection and that early tracheal aspirate should be obtained for specific pathogen identification.

Currently, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to primarily exist in the respiratory tract and to a lesser extent in the digestive system. Like other respiratory viruses, the positive rate of nucleic acid testing in blood is not high. The vertical transmission from mother-to-fetus via placenta usually requires a high replication level of virus in the blood. This may be the reason why no SARS-CoV-2 was found in the cord blood, amniotic fluid, or placenta as they were in previous studies [6, 38] . When the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG test in serum was proposed, neonates who had not been discharged were tested. IgM is the earliest synthesized and secreted antibody during human development. The fetus at the late stage of development begins to synthesize IgM, which is too large to be passed through the placenta and into the fetus. The rise of IgM is generally considered to be an indicator of intrauterine or perinatal infection. On the other hand, IgG appears to be passively transported from the mother to the fetus because it can pass through the placenta and can be synthesized by the infant after 3 months of age [39] . It is unfortunate both cases had no retained cord blood, placenta, or amniotic fluid samples so that we could test for the antibodies.

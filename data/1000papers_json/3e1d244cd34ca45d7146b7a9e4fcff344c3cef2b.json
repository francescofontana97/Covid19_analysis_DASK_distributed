Moreover, our studies demonstrated that a progressive decline of eosinophil levels was 297 associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients (Fig 2) . This finding was also 298 corroborated by other findings in this current study. Firstly, consistent with other reports[15], 299 we found that COVID-19 patients with critical disease had coagulation disorders (Fig 3) . In 300 addition, our analysis revealed a significantly positive correlation of eosinophil counts and 301 ratios with platelet counts (Fig 3) . This finding can be potentially important because previous studies have shown that eosinophils and platelets interact with each other [17] and that 303 eosinophil counts inversely correlated with stroke severity [23] . Secondly, we found that 304 COVID-19 patients with critical disease showed biomarkers of tissue injury (Fig 4, 5, 6) . 305 Importantly, eosinophil counts and ratios significantly and inversely correlated with some of 306 these biomarkers, suggesting that eosinopenia was associated with the organ failure and 307 tissue damage.

The above findings suggest, during virus-induced asthma 282 exacerbations, that preservation of physiological eosinophil counts and anti-viral function can 283 be important for fighting virus infections.284 285 At least two biological functions may contribute to the eosinophil's anti-viral immunity. 286 Firstly, eosinophils, when being activated by viruses, release molecules such as 287 neurotoxin/ribonuclease 2 and cationic proteins that can kill viruses[18]. Secondly, 288 eosinophils express molecules such as toll-like receptors, CD80, CD86, and major 289 histocompatibility complex I/II molecules that are sufficient for stimulating an immune 290 response. To support this notion, it was shown that influenza A virus-infected eosinophils can 291 act as professional antigen-presenting cells and stimulate virus-specific CD8 + T cell-mediated 292 antiviral immune response in vivo[19]. This is important because, if eosinophils play a role in 293 the immune defense against SARS-CoV-2, strategies to correct the eosinopenia in COVID-19 294 patients are justified to prevent fatality.295 296",

For this reason, we propose to analyze eosinophils in both blood and tissues in of our study is that we for the first time systemically analyzed the 312 relationship between eosinopenia severity and COVID-19 disease severity. We reason that313 such a detailed, focused analysis of eosinophils in the context of COVID-19 is necessary 314 because new research data have clearly suggested the importance of eosinophils in the 315 immune defense against virus infections[18-20]. 316 317 There are several limitations in this study. First, the study population only included 318 patients from a single hospital. Second, this cohort only contained 190 patients, which might 319 not be sufficiently powered for all the analyses. Third, because laboratory results from the 320 only one-time point were available, we could not perform longitudinal studies. Fourth, to be 321 consistent with other white blood cell counts, the eosinophil count unit used in current 322 clinical practice is x10 9 /L. This unit is ok when the allergy is analyzed, in which eosinophil 323 count is dramatically increased. However, it will be challenging to visualize eosinopenia using this current unit because of the relatively low eosinophil count. For this reason, we 325 suggest that the unit of eosinophil count should be adjusted to x10 7 Guery B, Poissy J, el Mansouf L, Sejourne C, Ettahar N, Lemaire X, et al.

Infection with this virus causes diverse clinical manifestations encapsulated in the term COVID-19. These manifestations include respiratory symptoms, from the common cold to severe pneumonia with an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiorgan failure. Nonetheless, most COVID-19 patients have thus far had milder symptoms. 2 The present document has been jointly drafted by the Geriatric Cardiology Section of the Spanish Society of Cardiology and the Spanish Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology to review the available evidence on this infection in elderly people, who constitute a population group that is particularly vulnerable to this disease and its severe manifestations.",

The Population Division of the United Nations estimates that the population older than 60 years will increase from its current number of 800 million to 2000 million in 2050, at which time this population group will comprise 22% of the global population. 4 While only Italy had more people older than 65 years than younger than 15 years in 1995, 30 countries had this demographic profile in 2017 and 5 more will have this profile in 2020. Accordingly, population aging is creating major health care and social challenges related to the care of this ever-expanding age group. 5 In the case of Spain, the population aging phenomenon is also well-advanced, with a doubling of the number of people older than 65 years in fewer than 30 years. According to the Spanish National Institute of Statistics, the current data from Spain show that the population older than 65 years represents about 17% of the total population, or more than 7 million people, about 25% of whom are octogenarians. 6 Projections made by the Spanish National Institute of Statistics suggest that people older than 65 years will comprise more than 30% of the population in 2050 (with almost 13 million) and that octogenarians will constitute more than 4 million or more than 30% of the total older population. 7 United Nation projections predict that Spain will be the most aged country in the world in 2050, with 40% of the population older than 60 years. 7",

In 2 series of 41 and 191 patients treated in hospitals in Wuhan that reported the profiles of hospitalized patients, the prevalence of the disease was higher in men (62%-73%) and the median ages were 49 [interquartile range, 41-58] and 56 years, respectively. 8, 9 According to data published by the Spanish Ministry of Health (table 1) , 177 633 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Spain by April 15, 2020 ; of the 57 106 hospitalized individuals, 24.1% were aged between 70 and 79 years, 19% were aged between 80 and 89 years, and 5.1% were older than 90 years. 10 These data are probably biased due to the underdiagnosis of mild or asymptomatic patients, as well as the existence of undocumented outbreaks in nursing homes. Accordingly, the actual age distribution is unknown. Nonetheless, these figures give us an idea of the gravity of the impact of this disease on the geriatric population, given that more than 30% of the patients admitted with confirmed infection are 70 years or older.",

Accordingly, although the mortality rate varies between 2% and 5% in different documents, it is not currently possible to obtain an accurate rate. 2, 11 Nonetheless, the available data clearly indicate that age is a major risk factor for mortality. One of the Chinese cohorts identified age as an independent predictor of mortality, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.1 (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.03-1.17) per year. 8 An Italian study that examined the first cases identified in the country found that mortality was substantially increased in septuagenarians and almost tripled in octogenarians. 12 The World Health Organization report of February, 28, 2020, based on 55 924 confirmed cases in China, showed mortality rates of 14.8% in patients older than 80 years and of 8% in those aged between 70 and 79 years vs less than 0.5% in those younger than 50 years. 11 Similarly, in Update No. 76 on the situation in Spain from the Spanish Ministry of Health of April 15, 2020 (table 1), the mortality rate increased from 1.2% in patients aged 50 to 59 years to 13.8% in those 70 to 79 years and 23.7% in those from 80 to 89 years, reaching 25.6% in patients \u2265 90 years. 10",

In a Chinese study comprising 72 314 patients (44 672 laboratory-confirmed cases, 16 186 suspected, 10 567 clinically diagnosed, and 889 asymptomatic), the clinical severity was reported to be mild in 81.4% of patients, severe in 13.9%, and critical in 4.7%. 2 In the more severe cases, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia, which is sometimes complicated in the most severely ill patients by an ARDS with distributive, cardiogenic, or mixed shock. Elderly people and/or those with pre-existing medical comorbidities are the most vulnerable and more frequently develop more severe forms of the disease. 8, 9, [13] [14] [15] [16] This aspect may be influenced by aging-related physiological processes, such as, in particular, elderly patients' higher prevalence of frailty and comorbidities that reduce functional reserve, which in turn decreases intrinsic capacity and resilience and undermines patients' resistance to disease and infection. 16 The most frequent symptom is fever. In a series of Chinese patients, 83% of those hospitalized had fever, a proportion that reaches 98% in other published series. 13, 17 There are no conclusive data on the clinical profile by age, but elderly patients frequently do not have fever (or it is of lower intensity), even in the presence of severe infections. 18 For example, a study of patients attending the emergency department who were confirmed to have influenza infection found that only 32% had triage temperatures exceeding 37.8\u00b0C. 19 In a series of 56 patients with COVID-19, the proportion of patients with fever was smaller for those older than 60 years, although the percentage difference was small. 20 Accordingly, the threshold of suspicion should be lower in elderly patients and COVID-19 should never be ruled out in such patients due to an absence of fever. 21",

            "text": "The specific pathophysiological mechanisms explaining this association between CVD and the frequency and severity of COVID-19 infection are unknown but age may be one of the factors involved, beyond the simple epidemiological association. First, age is both a risk factor for cardiovascular conditions and progressive deterioration of the immune system; indeed, changes in the immune response have been associated with a higher prevalence of CVD. 27, 28 Specifically, in COVID-19 infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme (an integral membrane protein with multiple physiological functions) has been identified as the cellular entry point for the virus. Additionally, binding of the virus to this receptor alters a lung-protective mechanism, which may contribute to its pathogenicity. 29, 30 Patients with hypertension and CVD have been theorized to be more susceptible to the infection due to an elevated concentration of angiotensin-converting enzyme receptors secondary to treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. 23, 31 Nonetheless, this relationship remains to be fully elucidated and there are no clear evidence related to the possible influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy on the clinical course of the disease; both the European Society of Cardiology and the Spanish Society of Cardiology do not recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers discontinuation. 32 Moreover, in addition to an association between a history of CVD and the presence and severity of COVID-19, the infection is itself associated with cardiovascular manifestations. Troponin elevation is frequent, and in a higher proportion and to a greater extent in patients with severe infections. [33] [34] [35] As in other coronaviruses, myocarditis development has been described in patients with COVID-19, although its prevalence is unknown. In a series of 150 patients, 7% of deaths were attributed to myocarditis, and mononuclear infiltration has been found in myocardial tissue in autopsy studies. 33, 36, 37 Clinical signs of heart failure are frequent in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (up to 29% in some of the published series), which could be due both to decompensation of a pre-existing disease and to the development of myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy. 8, 38 Heart failure increases mortality and can also confound suspicion of COVID-19 infection in patients who attend emergency departments with dyspnea. It is unknown if the infection is associated with coronary heart disease, but there is evidence that patients with respiratory infections have an elevated risk of acute myocardial infarction, probably due to atherosclerotic plaque destabilization. Indeed, Kwong et al. 39 found that, in the first 7 days after a confirmed respiratory viral infection, there is a significant increase in acute myocardial infarction vs the onset of this event 1 year before or after this risk period. Curiously, in the subgroup analysis, this higher incidence of acute myocardial infarction was only confirmed in patients older than 65 years. 39 To conclude, patients with COVID-19 exhibit changes in coagulation parameters and, in particular, an elevated concentration of D-dimer, which may increase thrombogenic risk and is associated with higher mortality. However, the clinical impact of these phenomena is unknown, as well as the optimal treatment. 8, 40 There are thus far no data on the differential cardiac involvement in elderly patients. Nonetheless, a higher percentage of these types of complications is likely due to the association with more severe clinical symptoms and the higher prevalence of previous CVD in this population group. Future data will provide more evidence on the risk stratification, particularly in patients with previous CVD, as well as on the impact of the viral infection on the cardiovascular system.",

This concerns the care of patients infected with COVID-19, as described above, but also affects patients with all types of conditions.

However, chronological age should again not be the main consideration in decision-making. Besides age, attention must be paid to other aspects determining theoretical life expectancy. The recent statement of the Executive Board of the European Geriatric Medicine Society stressed that advanced age cannot by itself be a reason for excluding patients from specialized hospital units. 46 Regardless, any patients rejected from specialized hospital units must be ensured access to medical care, symptomatic management, and palliative treatment if required.",

The first refers to resource organization and availability and, besides aspects related to material resource optimization, to the promotion of procedures that facilitate the withdrawal of mechanical ventilation and streamline patient transfer to a general ward. The second point refers to the global situation and patient characteristics. The most relevant aspect in terms of older people is their biological age and the use of clinical frailty scales, frailty indices, and comprehensive geriatric assessment, with age not per se a reason to block ICU admission. In this population, a therapeutic adequacy plan must be established at admission and recorded in the clinical history; it must be made clear whether the patient is a candidate for mechanical ventilation or not and a treatment deintensification plan should be specified to avoid futility if the patient deteriorates. The third point concerns the ethics of decision-making. Priority must be given to decisions that maximize survival to discharge and the number of life-years saved and give patients a chance to live each stage of their lives. Reference is once again made to chronological age as a factor that should never be the only consideration. Decisions must be based on the opportunity cost principle and the need to maximize the common good, that is, admit those patients who will benefit the most, independent of age or chronic diseases. Patients with a minimum expected benefit should not be admitted to the ICU and careful evaluation is required of the benefit derived from the admission of patients with a life expectancy less than 1 to 2 years. Therefore, elderly patients should not be refused admission to the ICU due to their chronological age and it is necessary to assess their general situation, as well as the benefit of admission. Regardless, the aim is to allow patients to live their current stage of life to the fullest. 47 In this regard, the Spanish Bioethics Committee has released a report warning that a utilitarian mentality and prejudices against the elderly or persons with disabilities should be avoided when ICU admittance is being considered. This report also stresses the social utility of every person simply for being human. Decisions must be based on the principles of utility and equity, and it may sometimes be fairer to give preference to the most vulnerable groups. 47 Age should never be considered a reason to deny or limit health care.",

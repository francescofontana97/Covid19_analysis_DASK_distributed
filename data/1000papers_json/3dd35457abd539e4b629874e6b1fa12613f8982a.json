We give a edge-weighted graph reduction of the dynamics of the process that allows us to apply standard results of Erd\u0151s-Renyi random graphs on the particle set. In particular, we show how the parameters of the model produce two phase transitions: In the subcritical regime, O(ln k) particles are infected. In the supercritical regime, for a constant C determined by the parameters of the model, Ck get infected with probability C, and O(ln k) get infected with probability (1 \u2212 C). Finally, there is a regime in which all k particles are infected. Furthermore, the edge weights give information about when a particle becomes infected. We demonstrate how this can be exploited to determine the completion time of the process by applying a result of Janson on randomly edge weighted graphs.",

More recently, there has been an increasing interest in understanding the impact of the network topology on the spread of epidemics in networks with fixed nodes, see [13] for a review of such results.

Furthermore, it is relevant to studying the dissemination of information in opportunistic networks [5] where the information is transmitted between users who happen to be in each others range.

            "text": "In our model (elaborated upon below) the virus can be carried by k particles making independent random walks on an n-vertex r-regular random graph G which represents the environment. Each particle is in one of three states: susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R). An infected particle can infect a susceptible particle, which remains infected for a fixed infectious period \u03be before recovering permanently. This is a known as the SIR epidemic model and is extensively studied in the literature. When \u03be = \u221e (the SI model ) particles never go from I to R. Two questions can be asked: (1) When \u03be < \u221e, how many particles ever get infected? (2) How long does the process take to complete? We address both of these questions by reducing the dynamics of the process to what we term an interaction graph. This is an Erd\u0151s-Renyi (E-R) random graph G k,q on the set of particles, where the edge probabilityq is a function of the parameters of the model. Infected particles are connected components in G k,q , and so well known results from the literature on E-R random graphs can be directly applied using our reduction to answer question (1) . In particular, we show how the parameters of the model produce two phase transitions: In the subcritical regime, O(ln k) particles are infected. In the supercritical regime, for a constant C determined by the parameters of the model, Ck get infected with probability C, and O(ln k) get infected with probability (1 \u2212 C). Finally, there is a regime in which all k particles are infected. Statements are with high probability (whp), that is, with probability tending to 1 as n \u2192 \u221e. Furthermore, the graph reduction assigns weights on the edges that give information about when a particle becomes infected. This information can be used for addressing question (2) . As an example, in the case of \u03be = \u221e, we apply a result of Janson [16] on randomly-weighted graphs to deduce that completion time converges in probability to 2\u03b8rn k ln k, where \u03b8 r = r\u22121 r\u22122 . This matches the expectation determined in [8] for the same example.",

We term such an event an xy interaction and call \u03c1 the interaction probability. If one of the particles is infected and the other is susceptible, the infection takes place upon interaction. We define the completion time of the process to be the time step at which the last infection takes place. Consider that the counter has just changed from time step t \u2212 1 to t. The sequence of actions is as follows: (i)Every particle makes an independent move in its random walk. (ii)A particle x \u2208 I(t \u2212 1) that had reached the end of its infectious period by time t changes from state I to state R, so x / \u2208 I(t) and x \u2208 R(t). Otherwise, it remains in state I, i.e., x \u2208 I(t). (iii)Each pair of particles x, y at the same vertex v interact with probability \u03c1; the particle-pair interactions are independent of each other. If one of x or y is in I(t), and the other was in S(t \u2212 1), the latter becomes infected, and it becomes a member of I(t). New infections are considered to have started at time t; we say a particle is infected at step t, and step t counts as one unit in the infectious period.

In [10] the authors provide a review of the results, techniques and conjectures when the graph is an infinite lattice. In [21] , the authors explore by means of mean-field approximations the evolution of the number of infected individuals when individuals perform random motions on the plane. Recent papers by Peres et al [19] and Pettarin et al [22] both analyse mobile networks modeled as multiple random walks; the former as Brownian motion on R d and the latter as walks on the grid. In each case, there is a parameter r within which distance a pair of walks can communicate, producing a communication graph (which is disconnected below a certain threshold r c ). [19] studies various aspects of the communication graph, such as how long it takes a particular point to become part of the giant component. [22] studies the broadcast time T B of a piece of information and originating in one agent in relation to r. Setting r = 0 means information is passed only when particles are coincident. In this case, T B is equivalent to our completion time and [22] give T B =\u0398(n/ \u221a k). Of closer relevance to this work are [12] and [11] . Both of these papers study infections carried by random walks on graphs. In particular [11] analyses an SI model similar to ours; multiple random walks on a graph G that carry a virus, and the quantity of interest is the completion time. They give a general upper bound E[T k ] = O(m * ln k) for any graph G, where m * is the expected meeting time of a pair of random walks maximised over all pairs of starting vertices. Special cases are analysed too, in particular, they give an upperbound of E[T k ] = O( nr k ln k ln n) for random r-regular graphs. This is a factor ln n larger than the precise value of the process considered in this paper.",

A fixed set of n vertices is part of a dynamic random graph process where each edge is an independent two-state Markov chain, either existing or not existing. A single initial vertex initially holds a message and any vertex which receives this message broadcasts it on existing edges for the next k steps. Although flooding is a different process to multiple random walks, the authors develop a reduction to a weighted random graph with some similarity to the interaction graphs we present. It allows them to derive relations between the edge-Markov probabilities and state asymptotic bounds on the number of vertices that receive the message, as well as the broadcast (equivalently, completion) time.",

We assume the following: A typical graph (formally defined in the appendix) is one that has a number of specific properties. It is connected and non-bipartite, which implies that a random walk will converge to a stationary distribution \u03c0 on the vertex set. Because the graph is regular, \u03c0 will be the uniform distribution. A typical graph also has good expansion properties, meaning that a random walk will converge quickly to the stationary distribution; it will be rapidly mixing. In fact, for all the graph we consider, O(k ln n) steps is sufficient for our results. A typical graph also has most of its vertices treelike. A vertex v is treelike if there is no cycle in the subgraph G[v, L 1 ] induced by the set of vertices within distance L 1 = 1 log r n of v, where 1 > 0 is a sufficiently small constant. The near-uniformity and treelike structure throughout the graph allows us to make precise calculations for the behaviour of a random walk from a treelike vertex within the period of the mixing time. This helps us separete the analysis of the period within the mixing time from the period after it. The rapid mixing means that the dynamics of the process is dominated by the long-term behaviour very quickly, and that essentially, short-term behaviour is restricted to groups of local interactions that don't interfere with each other. This provides a degree of homogeneity to the process.",

We reported approximately 3% of the population in Wales became unemployed during the first 3-4 months of the pandemic, and 32% of those in employment have been placed on furlough. These furlough estimates are comparable to other data from the same time period which indicate 29% of jobs in Wales have been furloughed [23] and 31% of the jobs in the UK overall [24] . Of concern, however, is the disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups in the population that are currently supported by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme ('furlough'). Not all individuals placed on furlough (and subsequent job retention schemes) will ultimately lose their jobs, but there is the potential for the impact on employment and health to be greatest amongst the most vulnerable sub-populations when this scheme and its planned replacement, the Job Support Scheme ceases. Evidence indicates that pandemics have the potential to exacerbate inequalities [11, 25, 26] , especially within the most deprived communities and our findings suggest COVID-19 will have a similar impact.",

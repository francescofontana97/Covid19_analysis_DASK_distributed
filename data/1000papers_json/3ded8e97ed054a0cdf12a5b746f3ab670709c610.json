The impact of these measures is supported by data from the southern hemisphere for the year 2020, where a substantial reduction in flu infections has been registered. On the other hand, the co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses can further impact health systems and the fragile population. For these reasons, WHO has deemed it appropriate to publish a supplementary document to the position paper on influenza dated 2012, confirming health workers, elderly, people with chronic diseases and pregnant women as groups at risk for which vaccination is recommended. In the document dated 21 September 2020, subjects at risk have been further classified, giving priority to healthcare workers and elderly over pregnant women, subjects at risk and children. Healthcare workers and the elderly are among the groups with the highest priority: the former must be vaccinated to avoid work absenteeism and to reduce the spread of viruses within health facilities, and the latter must be vaccinated as they are at a greater risk of severe disease both for COVID-19 and for flu-related complications. It is highlighted that residents in nursing homes and those >50 years of age should be identified as subjects to be urgently vaccinated, particularly in areas at greater risk for COVID-19. However, this new classification of at-risk groups should not negatively impact on already planned flu vaccination programs [17] .",

One of the reasons for this slowdown is linked to the relocation of health personnel and in particular of those involved in this service (more than 33% throughout the national territory) who have been called upon to support the management of the pandemic in the Public Health Departments. In addition to this, the measures of social isolation and distancing initially led to the reduction or even the suspension of vaccination activities. The latter situation in particular involved about a quarter of the country's vaccination centers; this percentage has been even higher in the Lombardy region, an area that has suffered most from the effects of the epidemic due to the high number of people affected by the virus [20, 21] .",

In this sense, rescheduling of appointments has certainly increased the opportunities for contact between users and healthcare providers and for exchanging information and solving doubts. Promotion of vaccinations has involved, in addition to the staff of the vaccination services themselves, other professionals such as general practitioners, pediatricians and other specialists. It has been possible to apply some flexibility in the vaccination schedule to recover unvaccinated subjects, applying the most appropriate protocol based on the available scientific evidence. There has also been an urgent need to expand routine vaccination services through the search for alternative spaces, always in compliance with anti-COVID-19 regulations and by strengthening dedicated staff, also through a progressive autonomy of non-medical staff in the management of vaccination sessions [20, 21, 23, 24] .",

            "text": "One of the crucial points to allow the effective and continuous work of vaccination centers is to find new organizational methods that can support ordinary activities but above all that bring substantial and ready help during emergency situations that no longer seem so rare. Considering the proportion of individuals who have not received the planned vaccinations since the beginning of the pandemic, it is very likely that the overwork due to the accumulation of vaccination sessions will result in another type of emergency that the Public Health Departments will face in a not so far future. In addition, the future availability of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will lead to a further change in the organization of the vaccination centers. The introduction of this new vaccine should not distract attention from the remaining programming, which must absolutely resume at full capacity, recovering all canceled or missed appointments as soon as possible. Given the rapidity with which today's scenarios change, it is essential to train personnel who can help to achieve this goal. It is desirable that with the same promptness with which doctors, nurses and health care assistants have been relocated to deal with the pandemic, the activities of health personnel will be organized to recover the vaccination sessions that have remained pending. To this end, one of the organizational strategies that is already being implemented in Italy for the flu campaign is the involvement of pediatricians, general practitioners and other specialists in promoting and administering vaccines. This is a winning choice not only in times of emergency such as the one we are currently experiencing but also in a future perspective where the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will arrive and will have to be administered to the population. Given the reasons that led citizens to give up vaccination sessions for fear of compromising their safety, it is important to work more on the relationship of trust within which vaccinations should be carried out. For this purpose, the role of trusted doctors (pediatricians, general practitioners and specialists who follow the chronic patient) is once again central, as they are figures constantly present in the lives of citizens and have the best chance of establishing a relationship that makes the individual feel safe even in the most critical moments. Obviously, everything must be developed jointly with the Public Health Departments so that the aforementioned doctors have all the necessary tools to collaborate actively and effectively [25, 26] .",

The law decree of 14 August 2020 already ordered the regions to submit within a month (therefore by mid-September 2020) an organizational plan for the recovery and management of the waiting lists created during the first months of the pandemic. Despite the presence of a national legislative obligation, there is a strong lack of homogeneity in the response of different regions. Currently, not all the regions have drawn up their plans, and this is already indicative of how much the Health System is under pressure. In many Italian regions, the flu campaign started earlier than in previous years in order to have an early and timely immunization. In some regions (Liguria, Lazio and Abruzzo) the free-of-charge vaccination has also been extended to the age group from 6 months to 6 years. In all the regions that drafted a plan for the flu campaign, the vaccine doses forecasted were 20-50% higher than the previous year [27] .",

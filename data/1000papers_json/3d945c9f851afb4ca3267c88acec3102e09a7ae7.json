In this study we aim to understand how different factors (including virus type, 12 surface type, time since last handwash, and direction of transfer) affect virus transfer rates, 13 defined as the fraction of virus transferred, between fingerpads and fomites. To determine this, 14 360 transfer events were performed with 20 volunteers using Phi6 (a surrogate for enveloped 15 viruses) and MS2 (a surrogate for non-enveloped viruses), and three clean surfaces (stainless 16 steel, painted wood, and plastic). Considering all transfer events (all surfaces and both transfer 17 directions combined), the mean transfer rates of Phi6 and MS2 were 0.17 and 0.26, respectively.",

Surface type was a significant 19 factor that affected the transfer rate of Phi6: Phi6 is more easily transferred to and from stainless 20 steel and plastic than to and from painted wood. Direction of transfer was a significant factor 21 affecting MS2 transfer rates: MS2 is more easily transferred from surfaces to fingerpads than 22 from fingerpads to surfaces. Data from these virus transfer events, and subsequent transfer rate 23 2 distributions, provide information which can be used to refine quantitative microbial risk 24 assessments. This study is the first to provide a large-scale data set of transfer events with a 25 surrogate for enveloped viruses, which extends the reach of the study to the role of fomites in the 26 transmission of human enveloped viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. 27 28 Importance 29 This study created the first large-scale data set for the transfer of enveloped viruses between skin 30 and surfaces. The data set produced by this study provides information on modelling the 31 distribution of enveloped and non-enveloped virus transfer rates, which can aid in the 32 implementation of risk assessment models in the future. Additionally, enveloped and non-33 enveloped viruses were applied to experimental surfaces in an equivalent matrix to avoid matrix 34 effects, so results between different viral species can be directly compared without confounding 35 effects of different matrices. Our results indicating how virus type, surface type, time since last 36 handwash, and direction of transfer affect virus transfer rates can be used in decision-making 37 processes to lower the risk of viral infection from transmission through fomites.",

All negative controls had 0 PFU and all viral stock 118 concentrations had an expected number of PFU/mL. 119 The fraction of virus transferred (f) was determined for 360 transfer events for the two 120 viruses. Out of the 360 transfer events for Phi6, all three dilutions plated were TNTC 8 times. All 121 three dilutions were lower than the detection limit 38 times. As a result, 46 transfer events were 122 removed from the data set for Phi6, leaving 314. Out of the 360 transfer events for MS2, there 123 were no instances where all dilutions exceeded the limit of detection. The three dilutions were 124 lower than the detection limit 4 times for MS2. As a result, 4 transfer events were removed from 125 the data set for MS2, leaving 356. The instances where the transfer rate was irrecoverable for 126 Phi6 and MS2 are not limited to a single surface, time since last handwash, or direction of 127 transfer. The instances also make up less than 7% of the total data, and therefore are not 128 anticipated to affect the overall distribution of the data.

A greater transfer 226 from surfaces to fingerpads than from fingerpads to surfaces suggests individuals are able to pick 227 up viral particles from a surface and may not be able to spread them to additional surfaces as 228 easily. As a result, viruses may remain on the skin rather than be transferred off. Presence of viruses on the hands and subsequent interaction with the nose, eyes, or mouth, may lead to self-230 inoculation and subsequent infection.

First, 246 this study controlled contact pressure even though it is understood that this may affect transfer 247 (12, 14) . Additional work to include contact pressure as a variable may be useful. Second, this 248 study worked with clean surfaces and relatively clean fingerpads. In reality, surfaces and 249 fingerpads may be coated with dirt or oil and this could affect transfer rates by changing physio-250 chemical interactions between viruses and surfaces (14). Further work should consider the use of 251 realistically soiled surfaces and hands, which may provide protection to pathogens when the contact event occurs (26). Third, this study was restricted to two viruses and three surfaces. It 253 would be interesting to expand on these in future studies to investigate whether the trends 254 observed here for enveloped viruses can be confirmed with other surrogate, non-pathogenic 255 enveloped viruses. Finally, our surface sampling technique may not recover all viruses from the 256 surfaces swabbed. An inherent assumption in this work is that the recovery efficiency of virus 257 from fingerpads and tested surfaces was not distinct, so that the transfer rate could be calculated Phi6. Virus stock consisted of TSB with ~10 5 PFU MS2 /mL and between 10 8 PFU Phi6/mL and 324 10 10 PFU Phi6/mL. The higher Phi6 titer stock was used for fingerpad and painted wood donor 325 surfaces while the lower Phi6 stock was used for stainless steel and plastic surfaces. The 326 different Phi6 titers were required to obtain countable plaques from the recipient surfaces.",

This might suggest that enveloped viruses are transferred less 197 efficiently than non-enveloped viruses, however, the effect size is small (difference in mean 198 transfer rate is ~0.1). Both experimental and modeling studies suggest that enveloped and non-199 enveloped viruses can be transmitted via fomites, and that this transmission requires transfer via 200 a contact event and subsequent self-inoculation. For example, non-enveloped norovirus was 201 shown experimentally in a case study to be transmitted via contaminated surfaces in a houseboat 202 used by different groups in series (22). Betaarterivirus suid 1, an enveloped virus that infects 203 pigs, was shown experimentally to be transmitted via contaminated fomites in a controlled 204 animal exposure study (23). Zhao et al. (14) indicate fomites can be important in the spread of 205 enveloped influenza viruses. Boone and Gerba (2) summarize evidence on the role of fomite-mediated transmission of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses from experimental studies 207 and conclude its role can be important for both types of viruses. It will be important to repeat our 208 study with a broader range of enveloped viruses to confirm the reduced transferability of 209 enveloped versus non-enveloped viruses. 210 Enveloped virus transfer is higher from smooth plastic and metal surfaces than rough 211 wooden surfaces. Although stainless steel, plastic, and wood are all considered non-porous 212 surfaces, the surface of painted wood is inherently more irregular due to brush strokes. This 213 suggests that the microvariations in the surface of the wood may create a less efficient transfer, 214 and therefore a lower transfer rate of the virus. Such heterogeneities on the surface may prevent 215 efficient contact between fingerpads and the surfaces. Previous studies have modelled that as 216 donor roughness increases, the transfer rate decreases, based on touch probability and adhesive 217 probability (14). However, as recipient roughness increases, the transfer rate correlation is 218 nonmonotonic (14).",

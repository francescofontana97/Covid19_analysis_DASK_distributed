The largest number of students attends classical courses, and a smaller number of students attend distance learning classes. Distance learning is organized as online teaching. Distance learning program attended by students living in other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, neighboring countries (Serbia, Croatia), and other European countries or students enrolled on campuses in other cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina is similar to published research conducted in the United States [1]. Part-time study is attended by students who are already working and are generally older than 30 years. Regular classical classes are attended by students aged between 19 and 30, who live in Banja Luka or have moved to the city during their studies. Advantages and disadvantages of distance learning in relation to classical forms of teaching are a frequent topic of research and analysis of a large number of researchers in the world [1] [2] [3] . Researchers are particularly interested in examining the quality of distance learning and analyzing quality indicator [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

One of the measures refers to the interruption of classical classes and the obligation of the university to provide students with adequate conditions for learning and acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills. The Ministry of Scientific and Technological Development, Higher Education, and Information Society of the Republic of Srpska proposed online teaching, without suggesting specific forms of lectures and exercises. Professors provided various forms of teaching using available video and Internet technology (MS Teams, LMS, Skype, Viber). The Pan-European University Apeiron decided to use the existing resources and materials that are already prepared for distance learning. In this paper, the authors set a goal to make an analysis of the efficiency of the teaching process in the emergency situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Classes at the Pan-European University Apeiron, Banja Luka, are organized in cycles, so that classes in one or two teaching subjects are organized in one cycle. As can be seen from Table 33 .2, this way of organizing teaching has an impact on the first approach and registration in the e-classroom. In principle, students registered in the e-classroom in the month when the classical classes were organized (e.g., FIT 2 just 7.9% of the total number of students, who took the course, joined in November and 13.6% in December). At the end of the cycle, the exam was organized, when these students were probably given a grade. In the months in which the exam period was organized (January and April), the access of new students is visible (3.0% and 2.3%). In other months, this number is negligibly small. After registering a student in the e-classroom, the software does not record subsequent approaches, so it is assumed that students have accessed the e-classroom several times, until they successfully pass the exam (28.7%). A similar analysis can be conducted for other subjects. Furthermore, from Table 33 .2, it can be seen that the largest number of registered students was for the subject FSN 2 (100%) and the lowest for the subject SF 3 (6.7%). If the percentage of students registered in one of the 21 e-classrooms is classified in 4 categories, it looks like this: <10.0% for 6 teaching subjects, 10.0%-20.0% for 8 teaching subjects, 20.0%-50.0% for 6, and > 50.0% for 1 teaching subject.",

This data indicated that more materials available for listed teaching subjects were more interesting for students or were prepared in a more acceptable way. It must not be forgotten that the materials available in e-classrooms are intended for distance learning students. Results of the research indicated that university management and faculty deans should pay attention to these data and in collaboration with professors adapt teaching materials and other teaching tools to students in classical studies.

It seems that the students of classical studies used them by transferring and recording to personal computers and used them on the same way as printed textbooks. Classical students used very little HTML documents (Table 33. 3), which confirmed the previous statement. In order to improve the quality of teaching in an emergency situation, the university management should consider this problem seriously. At the beginning, faster improvement could be proposed to organize training for professors and administration who prepare educational materials and participate in communication with students. In addition, it is necessary to organize IT and other forms of training for students regarding the use of available teaching materials in an adequate manner. Communication between professors and students was two-way. In addition to e-mails, which were regularly used by teachers and students, outside the usual time of lectures, interactions with students also were held by phone, discussions within groups on social networks (Facebook, Instagram), SMS, email, Viber, Skype, telegrams, WhatsUp, and other forms of communication.",

Students most often used documents that are similar to the classic textbooks (PDF and video), and during the preparation of the exam, they kept the learning habits from the classical system. In this case, e-learning is a good addition to classical teaching. In order to increase the use of more forms of e-learning, the university should organize courses for the teaching content development (for professors and administration) and courses for the use of e-materials, Internet, video techniques, and other opportunities for better quality of professor-student interaction (e-mail, telephone, chat rooms, and other available modern tools).",

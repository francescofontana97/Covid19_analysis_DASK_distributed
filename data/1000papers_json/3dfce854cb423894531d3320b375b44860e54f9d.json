Primary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, mechanical ventilation, all-cause mortality and a composite end-point.

Our cohort had lower median age of 34 [28-43] years compared to the previous study (65 [53-76] years). Our median CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 0 was also lower (2 [1] [2] [3] in the cited study) (5) . Seventy-six study participants (13.7%) remained asymptomatic. There was lower prevalence of comorbidities in our cohort compared to the cited study (hypertension 12.3% vs 48.6%, diabetes 5.1% vs 15.7%, ischemic heart disease 1.2% vs 11.2%, stroke 0.5% vs 7.6%, and heart failure 0.7% vs 6.1%, respectively) (5). Chronic medication use was less in our study cohort. In terms of study outcomes, there were 2 deaths in our low-risk group, both of whom were in the CV\u22641 group. There were 19 (3.4%) patients requiring ICU admission, 16 (2.9%) requiring mechanical ventilation, and 59 (10.6%) with the composite end-point. We observed significant increases in ICU admissions (CV\u22641: 2.8%, CV2-3: 11.1%, CV\u22654: 50.0%, p<0.001), mechanical ventilation (CV\u22641: 2.3%, CV2-3: 11.1%, CV\u22654: 50.0%, p<0.001) and composite end-point (CV\u22641: 9.8%, CV2-3: 16.7%, CV\u22654: 100.0%, p<0.001) across the groups ( To date, a clinically simple risk stratification score for COVID-19 patients is lacking. Ruocco et al. has called for an urgent need to characterize these patients to identify the at-risk patients of ARDS (5). Our findings reinforce CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score as a potential tool to identify at-risk COVID-19 individuals in a generally young, low-risk, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cohort. The study demonstrated that CV2-3 and CV\u22654 groups displayed higher rates of mechanical ventilation, ICU admissions and composite end-point, compared to the CV\u22641 group. However, we did not see a trend for all-cause mortality due to the low-risk nature of the cohort with its overall mortality rate of 0.5%.",

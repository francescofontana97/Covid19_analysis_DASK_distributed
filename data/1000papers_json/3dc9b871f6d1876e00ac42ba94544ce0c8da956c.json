In studies in healthy elderly population, discrimination (olfactory thresholds) is the most affected olfactory function. A possible explanation of these differences could be found in the association of executive and memory cognitive domains associated with olfaction, related in part to performance on olfactory tests that involve identification and recognition, both closely linked to semantic memory. The association between olfactory dysfunction and clinical AD is largely due to the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in central olfactory regions, especially the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. The involvement of these sites is very important because they are considered to be among the first areas affected by the pathologic changes of classical AD [10] . In addition, a possible change in components of \u03b3secretase enzymes has been reported to be related to olfactory alterations in patients with recent-onset AD, as well as an influence of tau protein deposits in the olfactory bulb affecting the limbic system directlya finding very frequently found in AD and infrequently in healthy individuals [11, 12] . Moreover, as seen, in patients enrolled in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, the difficulty in identifying familiar odors predicted the subsequent development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a precursor of dementia), robustly correlating with the presence and the level of AD pathology on postmortem examination [13, 14] . A study highlighted that the sensitivity of predicting the conversion of MCI to AD was enhanced combining olfactory function assays to neuropsychological tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex volume [15] .",

A 2004 study demonstrated that people carrying one or two copies of the e4 allele of apolipoprotein E (Apo E4) have significant odor recognition deficits in comparison to those not carrying this haplotype [18] . Notably, the authors reported that this effect was specific to olfactory, but not visual stimuli [18] . Apo E carries triglycerides and cholesterol in multiple tissues by interacting with lipoprotein receptors on target cells. The three common human isoforms (ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4) differ from each other at amino acid positions 112 and 158. In particular, ApoE4 has arginine in both positions. The level of Apo E expression varies by genotype, with E2 typically having the greatest and E4 the lowest expression. ApoE3 is the most frequent isoform being present in 60-80 % of general population whilst Apo E4 is present in 14%. [19] [20] [21] . The Apo E4 allele is a key associated genetic risk factor for late onset AD (LOAD), whilst the Apo E2 allele is considered protective [22] . In particular, Apo E protein levels in human cerebrospinal fluid proved to be reduced up to 30% in E4 compared to E2 carriers [23] . Astrocytes are the predominant producers of Apo E in the brain, but also other microglial cells and neurons can synthesize it. Once synthesized, the apolipoprotein is secreted to the extracellular space where it serves as the primary cholesterol carrier. Other cholesterol transporters such as ApoA1 and Apo B are virtually absent in the brain [24] . A recent study reported that Apo E4 could lead to blood-brain barrier breakdown, especially because of degeneration of brain capillary pericytes that maintain the integrity of this barrier [25] . To date, however, the working-hypothesis on whether Apo E4 cerebrovascular effects contribute to cognitive impairment remains little more than speculative.",

However, how this happens is still debated. For instance, the UK Biobank Community cohort study found that ApoE4 homozygotes had 2.2-fold higher risk for COVID-19 positivity and 4.3-fold more case-fatality after COVID-19 than ApoE3 homozygotes. These strong associations were not diminished by excluding dementia, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or type II diabetes. Based on these reports, the investigators hypothesized that the negative effects of ApoE4 could be independent of these common age-related diseases. Interestingly, Apo E \u03b53\u03b54 COVID-19 positive subjects had a slight increase in mortality, with no statistically significant difference, compared to ApoE \u03b53\u03b53 positive subjects [41] . On the other hands, other investigators suggested that pleiotropies of ApoE4 may mediate multiple morbidities that increase vulnerability, involving genes in the so-called \"ApoE cluster\" on chromosome 19, that may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility [42] . The role of Apo E in modulating immune responses, especially through pro-inflammatory cytokines, could be the common denominator [43] .",

Feedback regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis by glucocorticoids is mediated through two distinct intracellular receptor subtypes referred to as the mineralocorticoid receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor.

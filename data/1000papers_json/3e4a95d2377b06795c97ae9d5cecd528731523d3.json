However, these estimates are controversial and it is unclear if this increased risk applies to patients with hematologic malignancies. One might hypothesize that also patients with hematologic diseases, particularly those undergoing chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, or other immunosuppressive treatments, would be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is striking that this population appears to be poorly represented in the comorbidities reported for patients with COVID-19.

Only 2.5% (3 of 119) of our symptomatic patients screened for SARS CoV-2 were diagnosed with COVID-19. The prevalence of the disease in healthcare providers was 0.9% and, as in our patients, no positivity was found among asymptomatic subjects. These data should be evaluated with caution in view of the following considerations. First, an underestimation of the SARS CoV-2 epidemiology in the general population is more likely than in high-risk subpopulations, such as those affected by hematologic diseases, usually submitted to strict monitoring of any type of infective complication. Indeed, our high-risk population underwent closer monitoring than the rest of the population who, according to the national government provisions, was not subjected to an intensive diagnostic strategy, particularly in the presence of mild symptoms. At least 10% of our patients underwent a virologic exam during the study period, compared to the less than 1% estimated in the population of the Lazio region. Second, the incidence of documented COVID-19 in the Lazio region was not particularly high and a similar study carried out in areas with a greater epidemic impact would provide different results. Third, 3 of the 6 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 acquired the viral infection in other hospitals or in long-term care facilities where local outbreaks were documented. The suggested basic protective measures against CO-VID-19 -i.e., frequent hand washing and disinfection, social distancing, avoiding crowded places, and keeping distance with anyone who is coughing or sneezing -have always been advised to our patients particularly during the periods of higher risk after immunosuppressive treatments. This could be a possible explanation for the contained spread of COVID-19 observed in our hematologic patients despite the scheduled treatment, including intensive chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. Probably, at the beginning of the epidemic, when preventive measures had not yet been disclosed, these historic measures protected our patients from the risk of acquiring the SARS CoV-2 infection. It is also worth noting that our hematology center is detached from the main hospital. This has clearly limited the risks of infections associated with a large multidisciplinary hospital.",

            "text": "Another important issue is represented by the risk of developing more serious SARS CoV-2 infections with a higher mortality than in nonhematologic populations. In our experience, 3 out of 6 patients were in critical care and 2 of them died with persistent positive SARS-CoV-2, but both patients suffered from a very advanced hematologic disease with a long disease history and severe comorbidities. Studies in cancer populations have reported that CO-VID-19 in adult patients with solid tumors has higher rates of severe illness (intensive care unit admissions, invasive ventilation, or death) compared to others, and logistic regression has identified cancer as the highest individual risk factor for severe events (OR = 5.4; 95% CI1.8-16.2; p = 0.003) [4] [5] [6] [7] . In the childhood population, cancer does not appear to be a condition that worsens the SARS CoV-2 infection outcome; in a study on 20 cancer children with COVID-19 most patients had mild symptoms and were managed at home and only 1 required noncritical care hospitalization for COVID-19 symptoms [8] . There are few data on the clinical evolution of COVID-19 in patients with hematologic diseases as mainly case reports have been reported so far [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . In a cohort study at 2 centers in Wuhan, China, hospitalized persons with hematologic cancers had a similar case rate of COVID-19 (10%) compared to normal healthcare providers (7%), but they had more severe disease and a higher case fatality rate (62 vs. 0%) [36] . However, this study has important limitations including the heterogeneous patient population, hematologic diagnoses and disease states, confounding covariates such as therapy of hematologic cancers, hospitalization, and interval to developing CO-VID-19; therefore, the independent role of the underlying malignancy in the evolution of the viral disease could not be documented.",

            "text": "Due to the lack of good-quality data, the question of how to manage hematologic diseases, in particular malignancies, during the COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging issue, even if some not-evidence-based indications have been addressed by scientific societies and opinion leaders [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . A risk-benefit evaluation should consider, on the one hand, that patients may be at a high risk of contracting the infection and dying from it and, on the other hand, that patients may be at a high risk of a fatal hematologic disease progression if not treated appropriately and timely. With the aim of reducing the risk of patient exposition to the viral infection, alternative strategies could be considered while waiting for scientific evidence, i.e., telemedicine services; a reduction of clinic visits; less intensive chemotherapy and immunotherapy regimens; switch to subcutaneous or oral therapies, rather than intravenous ones, when possible; and postponement of stem cell transplant procedures to a more favorable epidemic phase. Based on our institutional experience during the 2 months of the greatest spread of the epidemic in Italy, in which all our organizational care strategies were modified in view of the COVID-19 phenomenon while administration of the standard hematologic treatments was continued, we suggest not changing the treatment strategies of the hematologic diseases and implementing infection control models in the overall patient management. Definition of adapted strategies for healthcare services, including new rules for hospital admission, alternative models of outpatient visits, and dedicated routes for the emergencies of outpatients, represents the crucial challenge for the management of hematologic diseases in the COVID-19 era. A further clinical problem is represented by the interpretation of laboratory data in patients with COVID-19 and an underlying blood disease. Systemic COVID-19 could have a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis [40] . Lymphopenia, elevation of inflammatory indices, and coagulation abnormalities are common among hospitalized CO-VID-19 patients; however, interpretation of these laboratory alterations may be difficult in hematologic patients receiving chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Our 6 patients with COVID-19 showed no particular changes in laboratory parameters at onset and during the viral infection.",

Many clinical trials are underway to investigate the efficacy of vaccines and various antiviral therapies targeting SARS-CoV-2, but the inclusion of patients with hematological malignancies in these trials is variable [41] . Preliminary data suggest that convalescent plasma or concentrated hyperimmune globulin preparations might be beneficial either for prophylaxis of infection or the treatment of COVID-19 [42, 43] , and the case of a patient with follicular lymphoma who endured a protracted course of COVID-19 and rapidly responded after a single 200-mL COVID-19 convalescent plasma infusion was reported [44] . None of our patients was treated with convalescent plasma as this treatment is allowed only in the context of clinical trials in Italy. At the moment there are insufficient data to give specific indications for the prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV2 infection and disease in hematological patients; however, it is reasonable to consider convalescent plasma in patients with a severe viral disease and known B-cell deficiency with hypogammaglobulinemia.",

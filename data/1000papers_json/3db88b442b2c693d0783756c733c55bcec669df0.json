We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy. The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the error function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, that is, to the change in sign of its second derivative (i.e., the change from acceleration to deceleration), as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have also analyzed the predictions of the cumulative number of fatalities in both China and Italy, obtaining consistent results. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease in the number of daily positive cases and fatalities. Although official data have been used, those predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach since they are based on a statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as number of daily nasopharyngeal swabs, medical, social distancing, virological and epidemiological) or models of contamination diffusion.",

By positive cases, we mean the positive cases actually diagnosed plus, for future days, the positive cases that we expect a e-mail: ignazio.ciufolini@gmail.com (corresponding author) to be diagnosed. Indeed, it is well known among the virologists that the actual number of positive cases is much higher than the diagnosed ones [4] . However, it is assumed that the diagnosed cases are a good statistical representation of the entire population of the positive cases. In Fig. 1 , we report the result of our fit of the cumulative diagnosed positive cases in China. We have then applied such a CDF to study the evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy, in the attempt to possibly, statistically, predict the peak in the number of daily positive cases and the possible date of a substantial decrease in the number of daily positive cases. Furthermore, we have also applied our method to the CDF of the number of fatalities in both China and Italy, confirming our predictions obtained with the cumulative positive cases. Finally, in Sect. 4, we have performed a number of Monte Carlo simulations to get a more robust prediction of both the date of the peak in the number of positive cases, diagnosed each day, and in the date after which the number of new positive cases will be below a certain threshold [5] .",

We then evaluated the standard deviation of these 14 points, and we obtained a 1-sigma standard deviation for the flex of 3 days. The 2-sigma (95.5% probability) and 3-sigma (99.7% probability) uncertainties in the day of the flex are then 6 days and 9 days, respectively. In regard to the date of a substantial reduction in the number of cumulative positive cases in Italy (about 100 cases), the standard deviation is 6 days (68.2% probability), 12 days (95.5% probability) and 18 days (99.7% probability). Both the date of the flex and the date of a substantial reduction in the number of cases have a quasi oscillating behavior whose amplitude is decreasing by increasing the final date of the analysis, i.e., increasing the number of points used in the fit. Indeed, using the last seven evaluations out of the 14 ones, the previous standard deviations reduce by a factor of about two. However, using a second more robust method, by a Monte Carlo analysis [8] [9] [10] , we evaluated narrower uncertainties for the day of the flex and for the day of a substantial reduction in the number of diagnosed positive cases, as described in Sect. 4.",

However, the diagnosed cases are hypothesized to be a representative sample of the actual population (i.e., of the total number of positive cases, which is unknown). To get an estimate of the uncertainty in each daily number, we applied the following heuristic approach.

Then, for each of the 150 simulations, these n values (corresponding to the cumulative positive cases of n days) were fitted with a four-parameter function of the type of the Gauss error function, and we then determined the date of the flex with such fitted function for each simulation. Using the fitted function, we also determined the date at which the number of daily positive cases will be at a certain threshold that, for example, we have chosen to be 100. Finally, we calculated the standard deviation of these 150 simulations. In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 , we report the values (red dots) and the mean (horizontal solid line) of the Monte Carlo simulations, respectively, for the date of the flex and for the date of a substantial reduction in the number of daily positive cases. Using n = 41 days (i.e., the number of daily diagnosed positive cases up to March 26, 2020), the mean of the 150 Monte Carlo simulations gives the expected dates of March 25, 2020, and April 22, 2020, for the flex and the day of a substantial reduction in the number of daily cases (about 100), respectively. We then obtained a standard deviation (1-sigma) of 1 day for the date of the flex and of 2.3 days for the date in which a substantial reduction in the number of daily cases would be about 100. This result corresponds to a probability of 68.2% that the date of the flex will be at a certain date plus or minus 1 day and that the date of a substantial reduction in the number of cases will be at a certain date plus or minus 2.3 days. A 2-sigma standard deviation will give a more robust probability of 95.4% of the day of the flex and of the day of a substantial reduction in the number of cases. The 2-sigma values correspond to plus or minus 2 days for the day of the flex and plus or minus 4.6 days for the day of a substantial reduction in the number of cases.

The function used for the fitting is of the type of the Gauss error function with four parameters (a distribution function which well fits the corresponding cumulative diagnosed positive cases in China).

We thought if we could 212 expedite the process by coincubation of hemin and TMB substrate with the PCR 213 product to take advantage of the peroxidase activity as soon as the HRPZyme starts 214 maturing. Upon incorporation of these changes in the protocol we found that 215 coincubation indeed accelerated the process significantly as we could now clearly see 216 stark colorimetric difference between the groups in as early as 120 minutes (Figure 217 ",

To test this, we used primers against ORF-1ab as well as N-gene. We 291 tested two different PCR protocols for this using cDNA from nasopharyngeal swab 292 preparation of SARS-CoV-2 positive patient, SARS-CoV-2 negative patient and non-293 template control (NTC). In one strategy, we used H-inv containing primers for both 294 genes together in one-step PCR for 35 cycles, in another strategy, we used non-H-inv 295 primers for first 10 cycles, followed by another PCR with this product using H-inv 296 containing primers for next 30 cycles. We observed a clean single band corresponding 297 to ORF-1ab as well as N gene in first strategy (both genes yielding almost similar 298 product size 106 and 108 bps) with no amplification either in SARS-CoV-2 negative 299 subject or NTC. These results were reflected in clean colorimetric distinction across 300 samples and in absorption spectra at 450 nm ( Figure 5A) . However, in two-step PCR 301 we observed a lot of background in SARS-CoV-2 negative and NTC samples, which 302 was also reflected in colorimetric readouts and absorption spectra at 450nm. (Figure  303 5B). Thus, we decided to follow the one-step PCR strategy moving forward. 304 305 During initial phases of testing, NP/oral swab suspended in VTM was 306 standard matrix that was used for viral testing using RT-PCR. However, the sample 307 collection method was inconvenient for the sample provider and at the same time 308 posed exposure risk to health personnel. It has previously been reported that saliva 309 can serve as a sensitive specimen for detection of respiratory viruses, (Kim et al. 310 biofluid for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, and it was found to be a better and 312 more sensitive alternative to NP swabs. (Wyllie et al. 2020) 313 314 As salivary components have been shown to severely inhibit other colorimetric NAT 315 detection assay, such as RT-LAMP, we sought to explore if we could use saliva as a 316 specimen for our assay. We spiked serially diluted copies of viral synthetic RNA from 317 10 6 to 10 0 copies in inactivated saliva, performed cDNA synthesis and PCR, followed 318 by detection using HARIOM. While using N-gene alone, we were able to detect 10 3 319 viral copies (Figure 5C, 5D) . Using the protocol optimized above of using both ORF-320 1ab and N-gene in a single-pot reaction, we could bring down our detection limit to 321",

Early detection of infection via 58 mass-screenings of societies is paramount in curtailing viral spread as mounting 59 evidences suggest spread of infections by asymptomatic individuals. (F et al. 2020; 60 Hogan et al. 2021) Such information is also pivotal for defining effective public 61 health policies. (Hinchman et al. 2020) Several methods are being developed for 62 detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These methods rely on either detection of viral 63 nucleic acids using RT-PCR, LAMP, SHERLOCK, (Broughton et al. 2020; Esbin et 64 al. 2020; Park et al. 2020; Shen et al. 2020) viral antigen (Mak et al. 2020; Porte et al. 65 2020) or host's immune response to infection (ELISA, antibody based rapid 66 diagnostic tests). (Kontou et al. 2020; Petherick 2020) Each of these tests has its own 67 utility and utilization window. For example, nucleic acid and antigen-based tests are 68 useful for detection of active infection while antibody-based tests can identify 69 exposure to viruses and may indicate presence of protective antibodies. peroxidase-mimicking DNAzyme (HRPzyme) is a short DNA 73 sequence comprising of guanine (G)-rich sequence, which folds into a G-quadruplex 74 structure which is stabilized upon forming a complex with hemin. (Travascio et al. 75 1998) HRPzyme is able to catalyze the peroxidation of various HRP substrates ) (ABTS) in the presence of H 2 O 2 giving a colorimetric readout. The 78 short sequence of HRPZyme permits the possibility of primer integration in a manner 79 amplification of the target genomic region. Various HRPZyme and G-quadruplex 81 based assays (Xi et al. 2020) have previously been developed for detection of 82 pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, (Mondal et al. 2018) Salmonella enterica 83 Typhimurium, (Kim et al. 2018) norovirus (Batule et al. 2018) and even coronavirus 84 (Anantharaj et al. 2020) However their low sensitivity inhibited human applications. 85 Here we report the use of a modified HRPZyme sequence (Li et al. 2016) with 86 enhanced sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human samples. 87 HRPZyme Assisted Recognition of Infection by Optical Measurement (HARIOM) 88 offers the dual advantages -specificity of PCR and enhanced sensitivity of an enzyme 89 catalyzed reaction. Other notable features of the system include its robustness, 90 requirement of minimal technical knowledge and usage of inexpensive reagents, 91 making it ideal for use in low-resource settings and for mass screenings. 92 93 As HARIOM utilizes the power of oligo-embedded enzymatic activity, it 94 offers the possibility of additive effect from simultaneous amplification of multiple 95",

The reverse primer consists of 161 the HRPZyme complementary sequence (H-inv primer) in a manner that the 162 functional HRPZyme sequence would only be formed upon amplification of the 163 SARS-CoV-2 gene products (Figure 1B).

Despite having a significant amplification product on gel, the colorimetric 198 profile of non-HRPZyme containing product was similar to non-template control of 199 H-inv primer (Figure 2D), suggesting that the colorimetric difference could be 200 attributed to the presence of HRPZyme activity in the amplified product only. The 201 HRPZyme containing product is slightly larger due to 18 bp HRPZyme sequence in 202 the reverse primer. The HRPZyme sequence containing reverse primer was used in 203 non-template control to account for primer dimer formation. 204 205 Though we observe significantly higher peroxidase activity in amplicons 206",

These differences were also reflected in absorption kinetics of these samples at 218 450 nm (Figure 2F) wherein HRPZyme containing product started showing increased 219 absorption after 80 minutes, and peaking around 100 minutes of incubation. This 220 suggested to us that further optimization holds potential for improving this HRPZyme enables colorimetric detection of PCR amplicons.

We used five concentrations of 246 hemin starting from 1 \uf06dM to 50 \uf06dM, keeping TMB volume to 50 \uf06dl, and H 2 O 2 247 concentration as 0.25 \uf06dl of 3% H 2 O 2 . We found that 50 \uf06dM of hemin gave the best 248 resolution after 90 minutes of incubation (Optimization of conditions for best contrast. Hemin concentration ranging 253 from 1-50 \uf06dM was used with 50 \uf06dl of TMB and 0.25 \uf06dl of 3% H 2 O 2 per well. 254 255 Next, we optimized the TMB volume per reaction, as different volumes of 256 substrate may be utilized at differing rate accounting for the difference in reading 257 output. We used TMB volume ranging from 10 \uf06dl to 100 \uf06dl per well, keeping hemin 258 concentration at 50 \uf06dM, as optimized previously, PCR product volume as 20\uf020\uf06dl, H 2 O 2 259 concentration at 0.25 \uf06dl per reaction of 3% H 2 O 2 . This resulted in varying final 260 volumes of reaction for same input ingredients, due to varying volume of TMB. We 261 found that both, 10 and 25 \uf06dl TMB per reaction gave clearly distinguishable output 262 after 60 minutes of incubation, with 25 \uf06dl providing better clarity between amplicons 263 with or without HRPZyme (Figure 4A). 264 265 Finally, we sought to optimize the H 2 O 2 volume per reaction. H 2 O 2 acts as 266 oxidizing substrate for HRP, that reduces colorless TMB to its blue-green (one 267 electron loss oxidation state) or yellow (two electron loss oxidation state) form. We 268 tested different volumes of 3% H 2 O 2 , ranging from 0.1 \uf06dl to 1 \uf06dl per well, keeping 269 of 75 \uf06dl. We found 0.25 \uf06dl of 3% H 2 O 2 to give us the best results in as short as 60 271 minutes post reaction setup (Figure 4B). 272 273 In summary, we identified that 20 \uf06dl PCR product upon coincubation with 40 274 \uf06dl of 50 \uf06dM hemin-MES buffer, 25 \uf06dl of TMB and 0.25 \uf06dl of 3% H 2 O 2 provided us 275 with the best contrast in a span of 60 minutes. At the same time, the modified 276 HRPZyme sequence used provides much better sensitivity in comparison to the 277 conventional sequence (Supplementary figure 1Optimization of conditions for best contrast.

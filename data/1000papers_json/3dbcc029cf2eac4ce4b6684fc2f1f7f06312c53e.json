            "text": "The prominent role for the drug efflux pump ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) in mediating resistance to chemotherapy was first suggested in 1976 and sparked an incredible drive to restore the efficacy of anticancer drugs. Achieving this goal seemed inevitable in 1982 when a series of calcium channel blockers were demonstrated to restore the efficacy of chemotherapy agents. A large number of other compounds have since been demonstrated to restore chemotherapeutic sensitivity in cancer cells or tissues. Where do we stand almost three decades since the first reports of ABCB1 inhibition? Unfortunately, in the aftermath of extensive fundamental and clinical research efforts the situation remains gloomy. Only a small handful of compounds have reached late stage clinical trials and none are in routine clinical usage to circumvent chemoresistance. Why has the translation process been so ineffective? One factor is the multifactorial nature of drug resistance inherent to cancer tissues; ABCB1 is not the sole factor. However, expression of ABCB1 remains a significant negative prognostic indicator and is closely associated with poor response to chemotherapy in many cancer types. The main difficulties with restoration of sensitivity to chemotherapy reside with poor properties of the ABCB1 inhibitors: (1) low selectivity to ABCB1, (2) poor potency to inhibit ABCB1, (3) inherent toxicity and/or (4) adverse pharmacokinetic interactions with anticancer drugs. Despite these difficulties, there is a clear requirement for effective inhibitors and to date the strategies for generating such compounds have involved serendipity or simple chemical syntheses. This chapter outlines more sophisticated approaches making use of bioinformatics, combinatorial chemistry and structure informed drug design. Generating a new arsenal of potent and selective ABCB1 inhibitors offers the promise of restoring the efficacy of a key weapon in cancer treatment -chemotherapy.",

One of the types of adaptation is a network of often synergistic pathways that negate the efficacy of anticancer drugs (12, 13) . These resistance pathways can range from individual factors through to the 3D tissue organization and impact on drug efficacy by alterations to drug distribution within solid tumors, affecting cellular uptake, increasing intracellular metabolism/excretion, specific mutations within target molecules, evasion of repair mechanisms, and dampening of pathways aimed at initiating cell death.

Expression of these proteins at the plasma membrane reduces intracellular drug concentration and is therefore a first line of cellular defense. The mechanism of resistance is a generic one owing to the ability of efflux pumps to transport an extraordinary number and range of chemicals (17) (18) (19) . For example, the multidrug efflux pump ABCB1 is known to interact with over 200 compounds. The broad multispecificity of these transporters is a hallmark of their origin as environmental xenobiotic protection pathways. ABCB1 is normally expressed in a number of healthy tissues, particularly those involved in secretory roles (e.g. liver and GI tract) or in a barrier capacity (e.g. blood-brain and blood-testes) (20-23). Expression of ABCB1 in these tissues is regulated by endogenous transcription factors such as the nuclear orphan receptor family (24). However, cancers arising from these tissues frequently display inherent resistance, which is present prior to chemotherapy exposure. Consequently, overexpression of ABCB1 in cancer cells following exposure to chemotherapy agents is thought to be achieved by virtue of stress response pathways rather than a classical induction process (24).",

The failure of clinical trials thus far has engendered a degree of pessimism regarding the ability to inhibit ABCB1 effectively in vivo, and some skepticism regarding its role in drug resistance. This does, however, seem rather premature given the small number of compounds that have been subjected to exhaustive characterization. In addition, the power of combinatorial chemistry has not been fully exploited and the newest generation of compounds (from natural sources) not yet fully characterized, although there have been suggestions that inhibitor development is redundant because of the recent emergence of novel nongenotoxic anticancer agents that are directed against specific cellular targets rather than the more generic proliferation process. However, the majority of these compounds are cytostatic and many of these novel cytostatic anticancer drugs are themselves subjected to efflux by transporters such as ABCB1 (25, 63, 64). Consequently, the role of genotoxic drugs in cancer treatment in the near future should not be dismissed. Thus the problem of ABCB1 mediated transport appears to be a phenomenon that must be dealt with and the desirability of a clinically useable and efficacious inhibitor remains high in oncological circles.",

The elegantly simple Lock-and-Key model postulated that the enzyme contained a rigid binding pocket that interacted with a specific ligand and allowed subsequent release of the enzymatic product. Although this model has been refined over the intervening decades, classic Lock-and-Key type ligand interactions cannot account for the broad multispecificity exhibited by tranporters such as ABCB1. Currently, there are three general models that address multispecific ligand interactions. The first, proposes that the binding pocket, although still an essentially rigid region, contains different interaction sites that allow a range of structurally distinct ligands to bind (67). The second model, based on Koshland's Induced-Fit model (68), proposes that conformational flexibility within the protein allows the binding pocket to reconfigure and accommodate structurally diverse ligands. The third and most recent model is based on the the observation that a single ligand may bind to a protein in multiple and different orientations (69). The Differential Ligand Positioning model proposes that a single ligand might be able to interact with a number of spatially distinct regions of the binding site thus allowing multiple ligand molecules to bind simulatenously.",

Biochemical studies have established that the drug binding sites show a range of different behaviors with noncompetitive inhibition for certain substrates, indicative of overlapping substrate specificities; competitive inhibition for other drug ligands, such as vinblastine and doxorubicin; and cooperative allostery between certain substrates, e.g. ATP, vinblastine and verapamil (73, 78-81). In addition there appear to be multiple binding sites on individual transmembrane segments that have the ability to simultaneously bind distinct drugs or multiple molecules of the same drug (71, 82-84).

Structure-activity relationships (SAR) have exploited three decades of pharmacological studies on ABCB1 in an attempt to correlate substrate activity with specific molecular descriptors.

These stem from largely technical issues including the use of different assays, parameters reported (e.g. IC 50 , K D , K M & K I ), drug solubilities, and variable drug partition coefficients. Despite this, some general features of ABCB1 substrates that were first noted remain relevant in that they tend to be lipophilic and amphiphilic, have a large molecular volume, contain electronegative and hydrogen bonding groups, and occasionally a weakly cationic group. More detailed molecular descriptors have since been revealed by a number of different approaches (for detailed reviews see (86-88)).",

Various clinically used compounds were investigated for their ability to inhibit ABCB1 in vivo and a number of potential modulators were identified. Early attempts with these compounds to block ABCB1 in cultured cell lines and in vitro assays were highly successful and led to the first phase I clinical trials in 1985 (38). However, this and many subsequent trials with first generation ABCB1 inhibitors were plagued by failure in restoring anticancer drug efficacy. The clinical failure of these inhibitors led to the first SAR studies and provided the first insight into the molecular features crucial for interaction with ABCB1. Zamora and coworkers (89) provided the first SAR derived descriptors, however, these were not sufficiently stringent to be applied to drug development.

Quantitative models such as 3D-QSAR can be applied to de novo computational screening to lead the synthesis of higher potency lead compounds. In combination with in vitro testing and analysis, for refinement of the quantitative model, this technique has been used in the design of improved inhibitors and higher affinity ligands (103) .

The Catalyst/ HypoGen pharmacophore is capable of predicting the potential capacity for a query compound to interact, as in a traditional pharmacophore model. However, it can also estimate its potential activity based on a regression of the training dataset, as with the 3D-QSAR model. Many pharmacophore models reported in current literature claim to be reasonably accurate at predicting ABCB1 substrates. Ekins and coworkers generated pharmacophore-QSAR models to rank ABCB1 inhibitors on the basis of modulating substrate transport (117) . A single substrate pharmacophore was produced by overlaying verapamil and digoxin based structures, followed by fitting vinblastine, and the generated pharmacophore revealed multiple hydrophobic and hydrogenbond acceptor features as important characteristics of ABCB1",

Screening of ligands, also referred to as virtual screening, is a data mining approach that applies the pharmacophoric model to screen commercial chemical compound databases to identify molecules that can potentially interact with the protein. Potential compounds can then be purchased and directly tested using in vitro assays. Consequently, this approach has become a frequently used strategy for the identification of novel lead ligands. Several ABCB1 pharmacophores have been used in screening databases. Rebizter and coworkers used a propafenone based pharmacophore model to screen the Derwent World Drug Index (119) . This identified 19 new potential ABCB1 substrates but the study did not report subsequent experimental verification (120) . More recently, a pharmacophore model generated from 131 propafenone ABCB1 inhibitors was used to screen the SPECS database (134,000 compounds) and successfully identified two lead compounds with submicromolar range affinities (121) .

Four promising lead compounds (Elacridar (50), Zosuquidar (131), Tariquidar (54), and Ontogen (52)) were developed by high throughput screening approaches using SAR analyzes. Their nanomolar potency and efficacy in experimental systems (in vitro and in vivo) led to a rapid progression to clinical trials. Tariquidar garnered the greatest interest because of its high potency (100-1,000-fold greater than the previous generation inhibitors), its discrimination between ABCB1 and ABCC1, and its long effective duration (35, 132, 133). However, despite its success in phase I and II clinical trials, phase III trials were suspended due to unfavorable toxicity reports in the treatments of lung carcinoma and the future of this inhibitor is currently unclear. Clinical trials for other third generation ABCB1 inhibitors are proceeding and although the initial reports are promising, with minimal adverse pharmacokinetic interactions reported, these trials are still at relatively early stages with small patient sample sizes and no unambiguous reports on improvements in anticancer drug efficacy (134) (135) (136) (137) . Although the pharmaceutical armory is small, there remains a paucity of extensive inhibitor characterization in the clinical setting. More attention should be devoted to trials with large patient populations and a broad range of cancer types, with detailed information on the class of resistance and greater use of surrogate assays.",

Unfortunately, the majority of these inhibitors have also been reported to have caused undesirable pharmacokinetic anticancer drug interactions thus limiting their clinical application. Rapid technological advancements have made automated and semiautomated in silico approaches, such as pharmacophore and QSAR modelling, feasible for screening vast compound databases and developing higher potency inhibitors. However, despite the identification of a number of potential lead compounds these approaches have not yet led to the production of compounds for clinical trials. Because of these obstacles to ABCB1 inhibition some recent studies have returned to screening herbal and fruit extracts for lead compounds. These approaches are reminiscent of the first generation inhibitor screening methods of broadly sampling the existing chemical space in an attempt to identify lead compounds.",

The enzyme cleaves sialic acid residues on a surface receptor involved in anchoring newly formed influenza viral particles, thereby facilitating virus release from infected cells. Several high resolution crystal structures of neuraminidase have been solved, but of particular significance were those structures containing bound sialic acid substrate (151) (152) (153) . This provided critical insight into specific residues that interact with sialic acid at the enzyme active site. A combination of computational chemistry and examination of the crystal structures of neuraminidase revealed that the C-4 hydroxyl group of sialic acid provided a significant contact point between the substrate and the protein (154) . Substitution of the C-4 hydroxyl group with a larger, basic guanidinyl group gave rise to 4-deoxy-4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en (commonly referred to as Zanamivir or Relenza), which displayed antiviral activity (155) . Moreover, structural (156) and molecular modelling (157) data of the complex demonstrated that Zanamivir bound directly at the active site of neuraminidase. Subsequent clinical trials demonstrated that Zanamivir is clinically effective for the treatment and prevention of influenza (158, 159) .",

Homology models provide an invaluable starting point for the interpretation of biochemical data in the absence of high resolution structures (130, 173) . The quality and accuracy of a model is entirely dependent on the resolution of the template crystal structure and the template-sample sequence alignment. As a consequence, protein homology models are viewed as approximations of protein structures, comparable to medium resolution images and not suitable for use in structure-informed drug design. Furthermore, the reliability of ABCB1 homology models was recently confounded by the withdrawal of three MsbA structures. In addition, the only available structure for an ABC multidrug efflux pump, namely Sav1866, revealed an unexpected domain organization (65). This called for the refinement and reinterpretation of all previous ABCB1 models (65, [177] [178] [179] . Despite this, the quality of subsequent models has been improved owing to the higher resolution of the Sav1866 structure (~3 \u00c5) and better sequence alignment with ABCB1 (56% and 52.8% for transmembrane domains 1 and 2 of Sav1866 and ABCB1, respectively) (175). Furthermore, crosslinking data suggest that the unusual \"domain swapping\" architecture of Sav1866 is also adopted by ABCB1 (180) . The crystal structure of Sav1866, therefore, appears to provide a more reliable template for the computational modelling of ABCB1.",

For example, (1) how many sites are there, (2) are they located at distinct regions or within a single large domain, and (3) can drugs bind to more than one site? One technique that has proven invaluable in the quest to uncover the drug binding sites is cysteinescanning mutagenesis. This technique requires a cysteine-less protein template, and fortuitously, ABCB1 is fully functional in the absence of cysteine (184) . The substitution of residues at specific positions in ABCB1 with cysteine was used to determine the residues that are critical for protein function and drug binding. Using an array of ABCB1 single-cysteine mutants and thiolreactive substrates, (e.g. MTS-verapamil and dibromobimane), Loo and Clarke outlined a potential drug binding domain within ABCB1 (83, [185] [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] . The investigations suggested that TM helices 4-6 of TMD1 and 9-12 of TMD2 contributed residues to a drug binding pocket in ABCB1 (Fig. 18.2) . This was in agreement with earlier findings, using photoaffinity labeling, which indicated that the N-and C-terminal ends of the TMDs are involved in drug binding (82, 181, 183) . In addition, certain residues (e.g. residue Ser222) are within the binding site of more than one unrelated substrate, suggesting a degree of redundancy between regions of interaction. These combined studies provided the field with valuable information about the drug binding regions and the substrate-induced conformational changes. However, the highly reactive nature of the thiol-labeling compounds used, the",

Furthermore, conformational changes generated by flupentixol binding to ABCB1, as demonstrated by altered susceptibility to proteolytic digestion and UIC2 antibody binding, are distinct from that induced by ABCB1 substrates or competitive modulators (195) (196) (197) . cis-(Z)-flupentixol does not interact with ABCB1 substrates in a classical competitive manner.

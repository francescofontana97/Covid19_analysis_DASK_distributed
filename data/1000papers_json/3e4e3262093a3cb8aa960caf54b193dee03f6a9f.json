We developed a simple, MS-based method to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins from gargle solution samples of COVID-19 patients. The protocol consists of an acetone precipitation and tryptic digestion of proteins contained within the gargle solution, followed by a targeted MS analysis. Our methodology identifies unique peptides originating from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. Building on these promising initial results, faster MS protocols can now be developed as routine diagnostic tools for COVID-19 patients.

These results are in agreement with preceding polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses, exhibiting a higher viral load in the respective samples. We estimate the viral load to be on the order of 10 5 to 10 6 genome equivalents/\u03bcL gargle solution for the two samples, in which we detected SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, whereas the MS-negative sample contains only \u223c10 3 genome equivalents/\u03bcL gargle solution.",

SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein packages the positive-strand viral genome RNA into a helical ribonucleocapsid and plays a fundamental role during virion assembly through its interactions with the viral genome and membrane protein M. 3 It is also important for enhancing the efficiency of subgenomic viral RNA transcription as well as viral replication. 3 The N-gene was found to be the most expressed viral gene, 5 which is in agreement with peptides of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein being detected in our MS analysis. Clearly, further experiments are needed to test larger patient cohorts, but our findings show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be identified from highly diluted solutions. Our current method has the drawback of long analysis times (3 h per sample), requiring significant optimization for future highthroughput measurements of patient samples. Also, alternative MS instrumentation, such as triple\u2212quadrupole instruments, will be required to allow the detection and quantification of a larger number of virus proteins.",

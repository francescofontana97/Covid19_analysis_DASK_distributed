            "text": "DNA is a rapidly developing vaccine platform for combatting cancer, infectious and noninfectious diseases. Plasmid DNA used as immunogens encode proteins to be synthesized in the cells of the vaccine recipients. Introduction of DNA vaccines into the host induces antibody and cellular responses against the encoded protein. In this way, the induction of immune response mimics the events occurring during natural infection with an intracellular pathogen. There are a few distinct ways in which the vaccine antigen can be processed and presented, which shape the resulting immune response and which can be manipulated. Characteristically, the antigen synthesized within the host cell is processed by the proteasome, loaded onto, and presented on MHC Class I molecules. Processing can be re-routed to the lysosome, or the immunogen can be secreted for further presentation on MHC Class II. Vaccine efficacy is also highly dependent on DNA delivery. DNA immunogens are often administered by intramuscular or intradermal injections, but the immune response can be significantly enhanced by subsequent electroporation of the injection site, which enhances the delivery up to 1000-fold, thereby facilitating dose sparing. Other techniques may also be employed. For instance, noninvasive introduction by biolistic devices such as gene guns and biojectors, skin applications with plasters and microneedles/chips, sonication, magnetofection, and even tattooing has been shown to improve the efficacy of delivery. The debate regarding the pros and cons of different routes of delivery is intense but the answer to which route of administration is better for a DNA vaccine is too complex to give a straightforward answer. It depends on multiple factors such as the choice of antigen and vector, expressing tissues and cells, and the disease it targets. A number of studies have compared the effect of delivery methods on the level of immunogen expression, and the magnitude and specificity of the resulting immune response. According to some, the delivery route determines the immunogenic performance; according to others, it can modulate the level of response but not its specificity or polarity. All in all, research on the optimization of DNA vaccine design, delivery, and immunogenic performance has led to a marked increase in their efficacy in larger species and humans. This Special Issue describes the continuing efforts to increase the potency of DNA vaccines by manipulating plasmid DNA, adding adjuvants or immunomodulators (also delivered in the form of plasmid DNA), and by using a wide panel of novel delivery systems. These efforts are described in seven experimental papers and four reviews.",

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has forced vaccinology into a new intense phase of development, transformation, and innovation. Hit by the COVID-19 epidemics, the world has come to realize the importance of efficient vaccines against viral infections. It is comforting that the contributing authors were working hard in this field before the epidemic broke out: all publications of this issue focus on the development of vaccines against viral infections, such as HIV by Kilpelainen et al. [1] , Louis et al. [2] , and Akulova et al. [3] ; human hepatitis C virus by Masalova et al. [4] ; Ebola virus by Bazhan et al. [5] ; Zika virus [2] ; influenza by Hinkula et al. [6] and Louis et al.

A still more efficient way to ensure high-level expression of the immunogen is to use RNA/DNA layered alphavirus vectors, which provide a superior expression of immunogens in comparison with conventional plasmid DNA technology (Lundstrom [9] ). Besides, immunization with alphavirus DNA vectors elicits an immune response compared with the conventional plasmid at a 1000-fold lower DNA dose, allowing for considerable vaccine sparing [9] .",

Rapid publication of data has been a key factor in the battle against the virus and the role of preprint servers such as biorxiv and biomedrxiv cannot be underestimated. For instance, the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was published online less than two weeks after the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission in Wuhan City, China, reported a cluster of 27 pneumonia cases of unknown etiology, and only one day after the Chinese CDC reported that a novel coronavirus had been detected as the causative agent of COVID-19 (https://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319/26). Since then, COVID-19 research has exploded; never before have studies on a previously undescribed disease and disease-causing agent provided so much knowledge in such a short time. The remarkable progress in synthetic biology and manufacturing of DNA sequences, based on the availability of sequences, not biological materials, enabled the rapid development of vaccine candidates against COVID-19.

A concise review by Liu in this Special Issue underpins pre-COVID-19 era efforts to make DNA vaccines more efficient, comparing them with similar efforts made for mRNA vaccines [11] . At the moment, the reader may get an impression that the mRNA vaccines have the upper hand, specifically referring to the many advanced mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidates in clinical trials. However, the INO-4800 DNA vaccine also showed promise in a Phase 1 trial: INO-4800 was safe and well-tolerated and induced immune responses in a majority of participants (https://www.fdanews.com/articles/199278inovios-covid-19-vaccine-trial-placed-on-partial-hold). Taking this stand, we are far from expressing DNA vaccine pessimism. It is likely that the emergence of RNA vaccines as a viable vaccine modality and the technological developments that are driven by this field may also impact the development of new DNA vaccine and related technologies. Given the tremendous need for: (i) high speed in vaccine development relying on the availability of sequence information, (ii) the ease and speed of vaccine production using already established platforms, and (iii) no cold chain to allow for worldwide distribution, which are provided by DNA vaccines, one can be sure that the first vaccines of this type will soon see licensure for human use and find clinical application abroad.",

            "text": "When the smoke of the battle against COVID-19 and the race for an effective vaccine settles, we will face a new normal where the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 is hopefully controlled, although the way we interact with each other and the way we work would be changed once and forever. People would gradually forget the times of hardship that we are currently facing. It may happen that our collective memory will be shorter than the T cell memory. Nevertheless, we hope that the insights gained and lessons learned in vaccinology will prevail and that investments will continue to be made in this domain to further advance vaccinology and prevention of infectious diseases in all corners of the world, since every dollar invested in vaccinology has an enormous potential return in saving lives and improving peoples' health. As scientists and vaccine advocates, we have to act to preserve this momentum. One day, we will be out of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we can be sure that new challenges will appear on the horizon. We have to keep up the pace to be prepared.",

The 27 priority statements listed may help guide the direction of COVID-19related research about people with IDD, as they identify what issues appear to be important in this group.

These include difficulties accessing services, restrictions brought about by lockdown regulations and as a direct effect of fear and anxiety brought about by the pandemic and related media coverage. 8, 9 An increase in the frequency and/or intensity of challenging behaviours may be similarly observed. COVID-19 has also brought about a substantial change in the routines of the general population, but this may be particularly challenging for people with IDD, especially individuals with autism, who may rely on a strict daily routine to maintain a sense of control over their environment, maintain emotional well-being and minimise occurrence of challenging behaviours. 10 Perhaps understandably considering concerns over deterioration in the mental health and challenging behaviours of people with IDD, carer strain was also highlighted as a priority concern. Related to this, COVID-19 has also had an impact on the level of social support for people with IDD, including day centre care and respite arrangements, which will subsequently further increase carer strain. 11 Over-prescription of medication is a long-standing concern among the IDD community. Initiatives such as Stopping Over-Medication of People with a Learning Disability (STOMP) 12 have been implemented to endeavour to reduce medication burden in this group. During COVID-19, some non-medication-based strategies to support people with IDD, such as accessing the community, may no longer be viable. This may potentially lead to the risk of increasing reliance on medication strategies to support mental health and manage challenging behaviour.",

This is especially true during COVID-19, where timely professional intervention could prevent progression to the detrimental sequelae associated with carer strain, including reduced psychological well-being 14 and selfesteem, 15 as well as chronic stress. 16 It is essential that medication is only prescribed where all other viable non-medication-based strategies have been explored. 17 If there is no alternative to prescribe medication for challenging behaviour, it is imperative that the rationale is clearly documented. The response to medication should be regularly reviewed, with a view to discontinuing as soon as safe to do so, in keeping with national guidance. 17 Difficulties in understanding COVID-19 and the related guidance can be addressed through a number of strategies. These include healthcare professionals providing explanations to people with IDD during consultations, tailored to the individual's developmental level, as well as provision of accessible information designed for this group, such as that developed by MENCAP. 18 People with IDD may find the changes in consultations with healthcare professionals particularly challenging, including remote consultations via telephone or video-link, as well as professionals wearing personal protective equipment. A recommendation has been made to include several strategies to mitigate these challenges, such as slowing down your speech, using a positive tone of voice, affixing a photograph to your clothing and avoiding complex sentences. 19 The risks of assuming that an individual's difficulties are because of their IDD can be mitigated via thorough enquiry by healthcare professionals. They should also be prepared to undertake face-to-face consultations where diagnostic uncertainty exists, while strictly adhering to relevant infection control rules.",

The lack of physiotherapy support was mentioned. The sedentary behaviour and risk of weight gain could be particularly adverse for individuals if they develop COVID-19 and attempts to maintain physical fitness should be endorsed.

It is imperative that they do not experience further such discrimination at a time when their support needs are likely to be substantially increased. 41 Digital communication presents a crucial tool in maintaining contact with loved ones, and people with IDD need to be supported to ensure that they can use such technology in order to maintain crucial relationships during the pandemic. 42 There are understandable concerns about financial hardship for people with IDD during COVID-19, as well as for their care providers. For patient-facing third-sector organizations such as charities, particularly those that represent vulnerable and marginalised groups like those with intellectual disability, the World Health Organization recommend that the government provide sustainability grants to help continue their core work of representation of the groups they support. 38 Implications for research and service development Areas for further study in this aspect of care should focus on the experiences of people with IDD during the pandemic, particularly related to social isolation, with a view to developing strategies to maintain social inclusion during such challenging circumstances.",

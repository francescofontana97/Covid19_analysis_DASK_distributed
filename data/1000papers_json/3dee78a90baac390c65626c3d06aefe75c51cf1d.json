The available literature reported a lower burnout levels for PCPs than for 28 other medical discipline (12, [24] [25] [26] [27] . Two recent studies (21,28) reported a burnout frequency among PCPs of 29 about 38%, while the prevalence of burnout widely ranged in the previous literature, based on work context, 30 characteristics of the health care professionals and coping strategies (13) (14) (15) . In their study, Koh et al. (32) found 31 a higher risk of burnout (36.9%) for PCPs worked in home care setting compared to other setting (hospice or 32 hospital). In a health emergency situation, the psychological stress level of health workers is expected to 33 increase, thus facilitating the onset of burnout and other distress-related syndromes (11, 29) . During COVID-19 1 settings, inferring the burden of the pandemic on the PCPs psychological status results a very demanding 2 challenge. For this reason, the present study for the first time aimed to compare burnout level during Covid-19 3 emergency with MBI scores of a similar sample collected four years ago (14) in the same home PC service. 4",

Depersonalization, intended as an attitude of emotional disengagement from one's work, could 11 increase the risk of medical errors and render difficult the adaptivity to change (48,52). Other studies reported an 12 association between burnout and worst indicators of patient safety increasing the risk of adverse events 13 (20,48,53-55). On the contrary, a greater personal accomplishment makes PCPs feeling more self-efficacious in 14 coping with patients' needs, encouraging them to take in charge challenging clinical tasks (48). Although the 15 majority of evidence suggested a negative impact of burnout on the professional performance, the available 16 literature did not provide clear evidence on the relationship between specific burnout dimensions and quality of 17 care outcomes (49,56,57). Starting from these observations, it could be interesting to investigate if home PCPs 18 may have provided a similar, or even better, quality of care during Covid-19 pandemic than in non-emergency 19 situations. 20 During the pandemic the home PC organization did not improve the psychological support for the PCPs. The 21 ordinary measures of support, like the monthly supervision with an external expert psychologist and 22 multidisciplinary weekly staff e-meeting with cases discussions, have been maintained during emergency period. 23 A systematic regular monitoring of burnout and psychological morbidity among the PC staff could become a 24 suitable strategy to early identify signal of distress and to develop additional intervention aimed at the 25 maintenance of the PCPs wellbeing. Further studies should be devoted to this issue. 26 27",

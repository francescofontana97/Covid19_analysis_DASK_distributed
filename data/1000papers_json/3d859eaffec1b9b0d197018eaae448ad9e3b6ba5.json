            "text": "Neurodegenerative diseases are sporadic hereditary conditions characterized by progressive dysfunction of the nervous system. Such conditions are generally associated with atrophy of the affected structures of the central or peripheral nervous system. Among the symptoms, vestibulopathy is one of the causes of discomfort and a decrease in quality of life. Otoneurologic assessments include pathophysiological evaluations of the vestibular system and its relation to the central nervous system, with an emphasis on the vestibulo-oculomotor, vestibulo-cerebellar, vestibulospinal and cervico-vestibular proprioception interrelationships [1] . Balance is essential to maintaining an erect posture and requires information processed by the visual, vestibular and proprioceptive systems. The proper diagnosis of a balance disorder and adequate rehabilitation are essential for avoiding instability, the loss of balance, a floating sensation, vertigo and falls. Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) involving virtual reality training can be a powerful tool for improving balance [2] . VR has been reported to exert a physiologic effect on the vestibular system, and this therapeutic modality based on central mechanisms of neuroplasticity can promote visual stabilization and improve vestibular-visual interactions during head movements as well as enhance static and dynamic balance under conditions that produce conflicting sensory information and diminish individual sensitivity to head movements [3, 4] .",

            "text": "Santos et al. [13] observed that the Soccer Heading, Table Tilt , Tightrope and Ski Slalom games showed significant results in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia. The study was carried out on 28 patients using the Nintendo Wii 1 equipment, twice a week for 50 minutes, totaling 20 sessions. The authors Lee et al. [14] used video game exercises with Sony PlayStation 1 VR equipment on a 27-year-old stroke survivor. The sessions lasted 30 minutes, 3 times a week, totaling 18 sessions, and the authors observed that the patient obtained 14 points more than the pre-assessment score with 34 points on the Motor Evaluation Scale; 16 points more than the pre-assessment score with 48 points on the Berg Balance Scale; 6.85sec less than the preassessment score with a score of 13.58 seconds on the Timed Up and Go test; 5 points more than the pre-assessment score with 13 points on the Tinetti Balance Scale; 5.36 seconds less than the pre-assessment score, with a score of 8.15 sec on the 10 Meter Walk Test; 4 points more than the pre-assessment score with 10 points on the Tinetti Gait Scale and 10 points more than the pre-assessment score with 21 points on the Dynamic Gait Index. This case report suggests that training using a full immersion virtual reality video game may be an effective method to improve motor function, balance and gait in a young stroke survivor. The authors Smits et al. [15] refer to the importance of virtual rehabilitation in post-COVID-19 patients, particularly those who have physical rehabilitation needs. The potential of virtual reality linked to rapid and personalized rehabilitation can be a solution to the imminent increase in demand for rehabilitation after COVID-19. Virtual rehabilitation can take the user through computer generated visuals to a realistic and immersive multisensory environment. Immersion of virtual reality can increase adherence to therapy and can distract the patient from fatigue and anxiety. We argue that the incorporation of rehabilitation on virtual platforms would help to stimulate the spread of therapy for both post-COVID-19 patients and other patients of different etiologies with similar rehabilitation needs in the future.",

The MMSE items were categorized by Folstein et al. [33] into five dimensions based on theoretical analyses and experiences in clinical practice. The Brazilian version of the MMSE was developed by Brucki et al. [35] for use in Brazil, and the authors proposed rules to standardize its application for the assessment of cognitive loss at follow-ups of individuals with diseases and during the monitoring of their responses to treatments. The assessment tool is referred to as \"mini\" because it focuses on only the cognitive aspects of mental function, excluding mood and abnormal mental functions [33] . It provides information on different cognitive variables [37] and contains items grouped into seven categories, each of which is designed to evaluate a specific cognitive function. The total score ranges from 0 points (severe cognitive impairment) to 30 points (best cognitive performance).",

The volunteer begins with the command \"go\", and the time needed to complete the task is timed with a stopwatch. According to the literature, there is no consensus on the results of this test.

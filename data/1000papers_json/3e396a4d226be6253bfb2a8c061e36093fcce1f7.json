The operations are linked together by equalities reflecting their properties. These equalities define a variety of algebras. This algebraic study of \u03c9-words have since been extended to more general structures, such as for example partial words (or equivalently, labeled posets) or transfinite strings (long words). In [8] , shuffle binoids are right binoids equipped with a shuffle operation that enables to take into consideration N-free posets with finite antichains and \u03c9-chains instead of \u03c9-words. In [3, 5] , the structure of right binoids in two parts is modified in order to enable products to extend over \u03c9, ie. small ordinals (\u2264 \u03c9 n , n \u2208 N) and countable ordinals. The latter algebras are enriched in [10, 11] with operations such as for example reverse \u03c9-power in order to take into account countable linear orderings (scattered in some cases). Some of the previous algebraic enrichments were also applied to shuffle binoids [4, 12] . The motivations in [3] [4] [5] 10, 11, 17, 22] are mainly the study of the links between automata, rational expressions, algebraic recognition and monadic second-order logic. In [7] [8] [9] 12, 22] the authors focus essentially on varieties of algebras; for example, free algebras are characterized in the corresponding varieties, and decisions algorithms for equivalence of terms are provided.",

In this paper we focus on algebras equipped with a parallel product, series product, and either \u03c9 and \u03c9 products or \u03c9 and \u03c9 powers. For example, the class SP (A) of N-free posets in which antichains are finite and chains are scattered and countable orderings lies in this framework. In [2, 6] this class has been studied from the point of view of automata, rational expression and logic. We prove here that SP (A) is the free algebra in a variety V of algebras equipped with a parallel product, series product, and \u03c9 and \u03c9 products. By removing the parallel product, it follows that A , the class of scattered and countable words over A, is also a free algebra in the corresponding variety. We also consider the class \u03c9 SP (A) where the \u03c9 and \u03c9 products are replaced by \u03c9 and \u03c9 powers, and show that it is freely generated in the corresponding variety V . Relying of decision results of [2] we prove that the equality of terms of V is decidable.",

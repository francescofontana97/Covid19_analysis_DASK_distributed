Our approach is twofold: a network approach using social network analysis techniques and a social services approach. We seek to analyze the different roles, strategic positions, ego-density and brokerage of the participating organizations. Furthermore, we examine the critical factors for explaining why the different organizations in the ecosystem cooperate. We find that associations and knowledge agents play the most relevant roles. Conversely, local and non-local governments rarely played brokerage roles to coordinate or inter-connect isolated operations of individual organizations. Finally, our results suggest important guidelines for practitioners that may facilitate the collaboration, coordination, and performance of a response network in the future.",

The stagnation on health spending in aging societies and the prioritization of cost saving has revealed the persistence of inequalities in health status and unmet needs for care still persist, especially in crisis contexts such as COVID-19. Quarantine and social isolation have worsened the situation of the most vulnerable social groups of our society. Among others, violence during lockdowns against women and children has risen (Nigam 2020) and an increase in the global poverty at around 0.3-0.7 percentage points in 2020 is expected (World Bank 2020). These facts reinforce the importance of social services to protect and support people against vulnerability.",

Social services comprise a wide spectrum of programs developed by the different stakeholders of a territory for collectives that need assistance or address complex societal outbreaks (Finsterwalder et al. 2017) . Within an increased demand for social services due to an unexpected shock, the development of networks between public, non-profit and private organizations providing essential social services seems crucial to produce collective and cooperative actions (Sanzo et al. 2015) . Interactions within these relational structures facilitate resource sharing and mobilization of stakeholders, making them more responsive to the territory (Proen\u00e7a et al. 2018) . For instance, Echeverri (2018) recently evidenced how voluntary organizations embed themselves in networks to accomplish their social mission and co-create sociality by participating in public dialogues, mobilizing resources of legitimacy, and development of social collaboration.",

An effective response to these unexpected shocks requires the mobilization of knowledge or resources, and the collaboration of an ample scope of organizations to provide the necessary social services to face the challenge. But, differently to the usual contexts (Abbasi 2014) , the magnitude of the crisis may result in a host of non-routine behaviors and new interorganizational arrangements in response to socio-economic needs (Stallings and Quarantelli 1985; Wachtendorf et al. 2006) . To a great extent, how these emergent inter-organizational networks articulate and integrate within the emergency context, shape their results (McGuire 2006) . This is particularly true in health crises which have become more frequent and intense over the last decade (Pan and Meng 2016) , see the SARS, 'avian flu', 'swine flu', and Ebola.",

When doing so, we pay particular attention to the spatial dimension. Geographical aspects have proven to be crucial in the COVID-19 crisis. For instance, a spatial analysis approach conducted in Italy claims the lockdown strategy to be effective to spatially contain the virus (Bourdin et al. 2020) . Even the New York Times (NYT) highlighted how the global pandemic has emphasized the failure of a global response to fight against the virus, denoting a geographical concentration in the countries and a loss of weight of supra-national entities.",

We focus on the mechanisms of linkage creation and the subsequent strategic position due to the expected influence on the final performance of the response system and the specific contribution of each actor.",

This spatial asymmetry when grappling with the pandemic has witnessed a shift in the initial nationwide efforts towards a more regional approach. In Spain, the impact of COVID-19 is tremendous and quite heterogeneous. The contagions are close to 233,037 with 27,490 deaths. However, while Madrid and Catalonia concentrate 56% of the incidence, regions like Murcia or the Canary Islands have been much less affected and experience an earlier epidemic slowdown. The Valencia region accounts for a total of 4.81% positives and 4.84% of deaths over the total cases. This region represents a paradigmatic case for the analysis of the COVID-19 due to its economic openness, international mobility, relative weight of immigrants, sub-regional cultural differences, internal differences in terms of rurality and population density, or the existence of areas with fragile infrastructures and response systems. These factors have proved to be relevant in explaining the incidence and effects of this unexpected health shock (Abedi et al. 2020; Mukherji 2020) .",

In line with methodological calls (Scott and Laws 2010) , social network analysis-SNA tools (see Borgatti et al. 2018 ) are applied to analyze traces of organizations' relationships found in traditional and digital regional media using content analysis. In our view, these are reliable sources as the mobility and business restrictions due to the extremely contagious nature of COVID-19 fostered the social attention to traditional and digital media to visualize the disease evolution and the social response (Gao et al. 2020) . Our analysis of the regional response is conducted by comparing how network members (firms, associations, knowledge agents, local governments and regional government) act differently during the period comprising February to April 2020 in the Valencia region (Spain).",

Thanks to interactions, network members share resources and commonly learn to face the challenges of critical situations. The pressures and evolution of the critical context determine the complexity and changes of these relational architectures in terms of objectives, operational levels or geographies (Guo and Kapucu 2015) . Previous research shows that during critical events, response networks are very sparsely distributed and there are a significant amount of organizations, dyads, or triads isolated from the other actors in the network (Kapucu 2005; Abbasi 2014 ). 2 In ecosystems, organizations strive to form linkages with other actors which may provide knowledge and resources (Provan and Milward 1991) . In this vein, the number of links an actor has will indicate the degree of centrality in a network that may reflect resource strength and generate further gains. However, inter-organizational coordination in response to disasters can better serve the immediate need in society (Hossain and Kuti 2009) . Brokerage is another strategic network position in which an actor connects otherwise unconnected actors (Gould and Fernandez 1989) , favoring network connectedness and coordination. In emerging response networks, isolated organizations need to step up efforts to retrieve the resources and information necessary for the operational effectiveness of the whole response system (Comfort et al. 2010) . In contrast, brokers manage the flow of resources and smooth cooperation among the different members of the response network. Despite their strategic profile, previous research has found that brokerage positions are assumed by relatively few organizations (Lind et al. 2008; Trias et al. 2019) .",

Geographical proximity stresses the role of immediacy and serendipity for the provision of social services through cooperation, while the networking logic refers to non-spatial forms of proximity in the sense of Boschma (2005) . In his seminal contribution, Boschma (2005) delves into the non-spatial forms of proximity. The underlying rationale behind the existence and relevance of the non-spatial dimensions of proximity is that the mere co-location does not necessarily guarantee access to successful interactions for collective action or knowledge sharing. Cooperation with institutional, organizational, social, or cognitive close organizations is more likely compared to collaborations with dissimilar organizations, since dysfunctionalities presumably outweigh decision convenience. Service research has frequently applied this proximity approach to explain networking and interactions (e.g., Gl\u00fcckler and Hammer 2011; Shearmur and Doloreux 2016) .",

But, we cannot rule out the possibility that similar organizations cannot cope effectively with an unexpected or even a forced intense cooperation within distant organizations with different information, skills (Waugh 2003) .

As a final result, the relational database brought together collaborative projects of different types, organizations, and geographical scope. The small scale of the texts allowed us to systematically read and analyze all news in the database, without resorting to software assistance. This allowed us to identify themes (motivation of the collaboration, the nature of the collaboration and its end result and the typologies of actors involved (highlighting similarities among sub-groups and patterns across or within sub-groups).

Again, knowledge agents and associations are the leading intermediaries. Despite some firms holding top positions, in this frame of reference, associations and knowledge agents clearly predominate. Further than a preliminary view of the position in the response network, we delved into brokerage activities of each segment to answer RQ1 and RQ2. Brokers are network members that lie on paths between others and provide bridges to organizations that are otherwise not directly connected to other members within the network. Gould and Fernandez (1989) provided a set of measures for the different brokering strategies to study the implications for resource access and appropriation. Based on these authors, organizations show a high \"coordinator\" score when they act as intermediaries between members of their segment. \"Representatives\" allow members of their group to contact members of another group. A high \"Inter-connector\" score is achieved when relationships are facilitated between different segments and they are not members of any of these groups. Finally, the global brokerage score merges the three aforementioned possibilities. Once the four brokerage scores were calculated using SNA techniques, we applied permutation models for statistical analysis of dependent data and ranked the supporting organizations to statistically observe significant differences between brokerage structures. These procedures are widely used within the field of social network analysis because of their robustness to dependence within the input data (Butts 2007) . Table 5 displays descriptive statistics and permutation test results concerning the brokerage scores hold by organizations of different profiles. It can be observed that associations exhibit a strong preference for inter-connector roles that lead them to establish broker relations between two organizations belonging to another two different segments (p value > 0.05). On the contrary, the group of knowledge agents plays a more important coordination role among other knowledge agents (p value 0.1). Although associations have preference for the inter-connector role, they also exhibit the highest level of the global brokerage score (p value < 0.05).",

First, associations vertically articulate the COVID-19 response network by mobilizing resources and information from one group to another group. For instance, business associations frequently coordinate inter-firm collective actions or connect support firms to re-route their productive capacity to satisfy the health services' or authorities' demands. Second, knowledge agents transfer information and resources from a knowledge actor to another. Conversely to associations which connect different organizations in the COVID-19 response network, knowledge agents search for complementary capabilities available in other actors of the regional system to provide advanced technological solutions. To the extent that the aggregate efficiency of the response network depends on the way these network segments and their members connect between them, it seems that associations and knowledge agents are crucial elements of the COVID-19 in the Valencia region.",

High values of egodensity show that the organization's partners are well connected and the organization's network is cohesive.

Members of networks of local governments and associations tend to stay more linked to their partners compared to the other segments analyzed, p value < 0.05 and p value < 0.1 respectively. Cohesion fosters participation, reduces resistances to cooperate, and enhances the contribution to the global performance of the group Kapucu and Garayev 2016) . Consequently, this finding suggests that local governments and associations tend to combine resources and knowledge from a number of tight interconnected partners to confront the adversity and achieve a positive evolution against the COVID-19 in the Valencia region. Connectedness is the crucial element that favors more basic solutions through widespread dissemination of knowledge and resource sharing (e.g., manufacture of basic IPEs). Surprisingly, knowledge agents do not present a relevant level of connectedness in our COVID-19 response network.

In this vein, administrative laws and regulations are applied to the public sector, while non-public organizations are subject to other laws. Therefore, our institutional proximity variable takes the value of one when both interacting organizations are public or private. When one organization is public and one is private funded, the cell takes the value of 0. Cells in this matrix take the value 1 when both organizations are public or private. The fourth covariate is based on the subdivision between private and non-private actors, accounting for the traditional barriers and lack of interaction. Both types of organizations are seldom represented in the same forums. This makes them unaware of each other's work and potential, often limiting collaboration to financial donations (Zyck and Kent 2014) . A new matrix measures whether organizations follow a profit or nonprofit logic. Cells in the matrix take the value 1 if both organizations follow a lucrative or non-lucrative logic and 0 otherwise.

Model 1 includes the main explanatory variables, confirming the relevance of the cognitive proximity on the creation of linkages (p value < 0.1). Additionally, we observe that profit organizations and non-profit organizations are more likely to connect with similar ones in order to face the challenges of the health crisis (p value < 0.1). This corroborates the endurance of the traditional barriers between both spheres, which is in line with the rationale underlying that shared vision facilitates the creation of collaborative relationships to overcome the coronavirus pandemic, and is consistent with our findings on cognitive proximity. Contrary to our expectations, geographical distance fosters the creation of linkages (p value < 0.05). This unexpected result possibly reflects the counterbalance effect of the cognitive proximity dimension and the need for complementary resources that cannot be accrued locally. Model 2 includes three interaction effects obtained by the cross-product of the four explanatory variables. While our main effects remain robust, the interaction between institutional proximity and geographical proximity achieves a significant negative effect (p value < 0.1). Therefore, institutional proximity and geographical proximity may counterbalance each other in the context analyzed.

Generally speaking, associations and knowledge agents play the most relevant roles. During the early response phase, associations took the roles of representative and inter-connector. From an aggregate perspective, this means that support and knowledge need to pass through these non-profit organizations which connect the public and private spheres of the socio-economic system. Conversely, knowledge agents act as coordinators connecting scientific and technological actors involved in the health crisis outbreak. While associations mediate between organizations of different profiles, knowledge agents mostly focus on organizations providing technologically advanced solutions.",

Consequently, when firms or associations sought to collaborate with institutions or transcend their local context, it was difficult for them to identify contact points that could mediate their operations with non-local actors. One possible explanation regarding the lack of government as brokers in the emerging system comes from the bureaucratic and inefficient attitude of local and regional government in dealing with the private sphere during the early stage of an emergency context. As confirmed by brokerage role analysis, there was no firmly established consensus on shared goals that could be activated to facilitate collaboration for social service provision in the early stages of the response network. From a regional perspective, these findings endorse previous results on brokerage analysis in collaborative emergency systems that highlight the ineffective role of certain organizations due to lack of a pre-existent social capital and the need for organizational resources to serve as brokers (Lind et al. 2008; Oh et al. 2014) .",

A dense ego-network indicates that close inter-organizational contacts among partners determine the number of resource needs, which is related to how organizations exchange assistance in the aftermath of a crisis or disaster. Results show that both associations and local government have denser ego-networks compared to other groups of actors. These findings complement Sadri et al. (2017) and Sadri et al. (2018) who evidenced that the density of an actor's networks is especially important. Not necessarily associated with density in physical space, they highlight that a highly inter-connected ego-network indicates close contacts among network members and can potentially facilitate information and resource sharing among them that it is critical for recovery. Also, we are in line with the growing relevance of non-profit organizations on disaster response. As indicated by Kapucu et al. (2011) , there has been an increase in the involvement of non-profit organizations in the national disaster planning and response process. Besides, these non-profit organizations experience enhanced communication and resource acquisition through strong network connections, allowing them to successfully accomplish their missions and social service provision. Finally, local governments are highly engaged in the implementation and integration of social practices (Jiang and Ritchie 2017) . Their network structure favors collaborative knowledge and resource sharing during and soon after the disaster within the locally affected areas .",

The coefficient for the cognitive proximity confirms the relevance of this aspect for the creation of linkages. Thus, organizations that are close in their knowledge, informativeness or vision, such as profit organizations and non-profit organizations, are more likely to connect with similar ones. This is reinforced by the fact that the results point to knowledge agents as coordinators in the brokerage positions. Geographic proximity or distance proximity usually plays an important role in boosting linkages and supporting social and cognitive proximities (Boschma 2005; Boschma and Frenken 2010; Shearmur and Doloreux 2015) However, our results show that geographic distance favors collaborations. The nature of collaborations to overcome the health emergency and the scarcity of local resources may be behind this result. Possible explanations for this fact may be the need for complementary resources which are not available locally or the fact of the predominance of rural areas or regions, which makes the presence of specialized resources more difficult and, therefore, in these cases, collaborations with locations with different possibilities may become more important . In short, our findings align with those arguing that geographical proximity may have detrimental effects when there are limited resources and a lack of variety and knowledge.",

This result is in line with growing literature on the interactions between different dimensions of proximity (Mattes 2012) . Particularly, we back Hansen (2015) who pointed out that institutional proximity acts as substitute for geographical proximity. In this vein, the existence of a common set of rules and regulations in the Valencia region diminish the need of being closely located to interact under a trustful atmosphere. Institutional proximity circumvents the lack of the trust fostered by the pervasive face-to-face interactions based on geographical proximity.

Knowledge agents, broker resources and knowledge between similar entities haste technological solutions. Associations connect different actors with complementary resources to deliver non-technological solutions. These actors complementarily organize their engagement in the provision of collective services.

Additional efforts should be devoted to improving the network structures of other actors involved in the response network. Particularly, attention should be paid to the implementation of tools and mechanisms capable of generating trust and smooth cooperation. Perhaps, targeting and acting on pre-existing social capital may represent a powerful mechanism to foster an immediate response. We also encourage the promotion of team-based structures as powerful inter-organizational tools that should lead to higher cooperation rates. These structures would smooth cooperation between groups and help to overcome institutional or organizational linkages, accelerating the growth and cohesiveness of the whole response network. However, programs should be tailored according to the specificity of each place. Note that either the role of brokerage or the proximity dimension may change according to each context. This research has certain limitations that open avenues for future research. Two main considerations limit the generalizability of our results. First, we focused on firms located in a region during the early stage of the crisis. Therefore, while our results hold for this region and period, care should be taken when extrapolating to other contexts or another temporal dimension. The intense effect of COVID-19 across many geographies calls for an extension of the scope of our research. To the extent that this paper provides a valid and replicable methodology, comparisons between regions at national or international scale represent attractive research opportunities. Particularly, extending our research to all Spanish regions and the subsequent comparison between them would allow to identify significant differences and commonalities to establish concise prescriptions for response strategy across geographies. Also, networks are built between individuals rather than at the inter-firm level. Future research should consider more refined approaches based on multi-level networks.",

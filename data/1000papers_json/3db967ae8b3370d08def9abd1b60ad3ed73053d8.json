The NIH has adopted multiple strategies to increase the role of patient and public involvement in dementia priority setting. ADRD national research priority summits include sessions led by nongovernmental organizations to increase non-expert stakeholder input and public-private partnerships [5] . The 2017 National Research Summit on Care, Services, and Supports for Persons with Dementia and Their Caregivers included \"persons living with dementia\" and family caregiver stakeholder groups as two of the six stakeholder groups informing summit planning and recommendations [6] . One aim of the planned 2020 National Research Summit on Care, Services, and Supports for Persons with Dementia and their Caregivers was to develop recommendations for research priorities to inform federal agencies and other research funders, but the in-person meeting was cancelled due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The summit will now occur via a series of virtual meetings in summer 2020.",

Through participation, representatives have an active and equal voice in the process. Participation strategies usually rely on small numbers of representatives, potentially missing other perspectives. Consultation strategies (e.g. surveys, interviews, focus groups) collect a variety of views from larger groups of people, but fail to give patient representatives an active voice in the process. Employing participation and consultation approaches as complementary may be the optimal approach to incorporate the views of a diverse group while also giving patient representatives an equal and active voice in decision making [7] .",

However, no prior research investigates the research priorities of individuals and caregivers living with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). DLB is a subset of Lewy body dementia, the 2 nd most common neurodegenerative dementia in the United States [8] . DLB is a dementia with clinical and pathological overlap with Parkinson disease (PD) and both fall in the pathological category of Lewy body diseases. However, DLB has important differences from both PD and AD/other dementias which could meaningfully impact research priorities. For example, symptoms such as cognitive fluctuations, hallucinations, and dream enactment behavior distinguish individuals with DLB from AD [9] . Individuals with clinically-diagnosed DLB survive a median of 3-4 years after presentation [10] [11] [12] , shorter than individuals with PD [13, 14] or AD dementia [11, 15] . Caregiver burden in DLB may be similar to PD dementia [16] , but it is higher in DLB compared to AD dementia [17] [18] [19] . Quality of life is also worse in DLB compared to AD dementia [20, 21] . Given these and other important differences between DLB and other dementias and parkinsonisms, prior publications reporting on research priorities in PD [22, 23] and dementia in general [24] [25] [26] [27] may not capture the priorities of individuals with DLB. We thus aimed to identify the research priorities of individuals with DLB and caregivers, particularly to guide research at our center.",

The care summit also identified the need to understand what outcomes are important to persons living with dementia and to engage persons living with dementia and caregivers as part of research teams [31] . Nearly half of the final research recommendations expressed ideas contributed by the persons living with dementia summit working group [6] . This emphasizes the need for funders (federal and otherwise) to consider research priorities from both dementia summits (ADRD and caring) when developing funding announcements and selecting projects to support.",

For example, the need for more education across populations was a common theme. Many participants mentioned needs relating to daily life (decision making, independence including driving, socialization), practical caregiving considerations, when and how to obtain and use extra support, and finances. These practical research priorities are consistent with previously published research priorities of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. The top six overall research priorities identified through modified Delphi consensus involving participants from dementia advocacy organizations were (1) cure and treatment, (2) caregiving, (3) education and training, (4) quality of life, (5) complementary therapies, and (6) care settings [25] . Similarly, dementia priority setting through the James Lind Alliance identified 10 research priorities, including maintaining independence, optimal care, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic care, and caregiver support [24] . A more recent dementia priority setting process in Canada identified 10 research priorities including investigating stigma, supporting emotional well-being, early treatment, health system changes, caregiver support, connection to education and support, necessary dementia-related skills and knowledge for healthcare professionals, dementiafriendly communities, best dementia practices, and non-pharmacologic treatments [27] . Research priority setting for people with PD identified needed research on physical functioning, symptoms, coping, stress, socialization, relationships, support, autonomy, and good care and communication alongside prioritizing research addressing PD causes, diagnosis, subtypes and medication for both motor and non-motor symptoms [22, 23] .",

The current results could serve as background for such a project specific to DLB.

This study can inform survey development to identify research priorities of a larger group of individuals living with DLB, serve as the background for formal research priority-setting in DLB, and help guide research planning. The study recruited individuals with DLB and caregivers from a single United States-based center of excellence, affects generalizability, though the identified topics were consistent with publications enrolling stakeholders with other dementias and PD. It is plausible that a different cohort could have identified different or additional themes. For example, because enrolled individuals with DLB had to have mild-moderate dementia (such that they could participate), they and the caregivers who enrolled with them as part of dyads may not have considered end of life research questions, which could potentially be a priority for families dealing with advanced DLB. Furthermore, interview questions were open-ended within categories and additional prompting regarding research topics could have resulted in different responses. The study specifically sought the opinions of individuals with DLB to give them an active voice and role, but several of the participants struggled to understand and answer the questions or perseverated on certain answers, limiting the information that could be gained from those interviews. Most participants were of white non-Hispanic backgrounds and had high educational attainment, potentially affecting generalizability. Similarly, most participating caregivers were wives and it is plausible that other caregiving roles (e.g. husbands, children caring for parents) would have different priorities.",

These findings support the research priorities defined in the NIH care summits in addition to the NIH ADRD summits. Further research is needed across all domains of DLB.

Specific categories of research included focusing on awareness, determining the cause, improving diagnosis, investigating what to expect (i.e. natural history) and disease stages, DLB symptoms needing additional research, the need for therapies to prevent, cure, or slow DLB, daily function, daily life, and quality of life, caregiving, and improving education(Fig 1). Exemplar quotes supporting these themes are provided below.Multiple caregivers described a desire to see research focus more on increasing awareness of DLB:So research I think could focus more on awareness. . . give it the same attention or least some of the attention that they do other areas that seem to overshadow this. Cuz I'd never heard of it. When I went in there and they said he had Lewy body, and I'm like, \"What is that?\" \"What does that mean?\" You know? It was like some rare disease I'd never heard of, and I know now a lot of people have it.One individual with DLB and approximately half of caregivers discussed the need for more research on the cause of Lewy body disease:Maybe this is where we should be starting first, maybe step back a little bit and say, you know, \"Let's look at maybe this'd be the cause of the-if a light went out, what made the light go out?",

A small minority of individuals with DLB and caregivers desired screening tests to identify at-risk individuals.Investigating what to expect and disease stagesA common theme amongst both individuals with DLB and caregivers was the need for research into what to expect with DLB progression: l-looks at-would predict accelerating dementia so that it gives me a little bit of time in my pocket, if I'm progressing, to know that, and to know what to anticipate. So the big statistical analysis might be the right thing. . . this is what we expect his or her course will be. I guess more on the stages, an' I don't know that they really know for sure, stages of it, how it progresses, an' progression time. In addition to desiring information on what to expect with disease progression in general, multiple participants described wanting research to identify stages of DLB. I see that literature about the seven stages of dementia with Lewy body, and I think knowing more about the later stages now would be helpful. Researching other people and see what stages-you know, seeing what stages their loved one is in and comp-, I mean, not compare but see, you know, the number of years. . . They say every person is different, but I guess if you gathered research and looked at it, you would see and kinda know what to expect, you know, at certain stages.",

Guidelines for when you should do different things, you know. Like, when is it appropriate to take over the decision-making? How can I tell when one of these [fluctuation] episodes is coming on?

This can be considered a limited degree of integration (Ahgren & Axelsson, 2005; Leutz, 1999; Valentijn, 2013) . This situation is partially due to the fact that nursing homes and hospitals fall under the jurisdiction of different governmental levels, complicating integrated care and making efficient cooperation difficult, (Eeckloo et al., 2011) . During a pandemic crisis in particular, a strong healthcare system with a 'one health' approach and with efficient leadership and a clear crisis policy is indispensable (De Ceukelaire & Bodini, 2020) . Moreover, increased privatisation has perhaps stressed the nursing home system even more, as demonstrated in other countries (Harrington & Pollock, 1998) .",

In this particular crisis, Belgian hospitals, including Ghent University Hospital, were able to provide the necessary support by requiring postponement of non-urgent admissions and procedures from the beginning of March.

            "text": "mid-March, alarming signals and support questions reached the hospital from these nursing homes. In order to meet the needs of the nursing homes, a partnership was set up to cover the different phases of the crisis, resulting in a collaboration that fulfils needs that normally would have been covered by an integrated care model involving different levels of health care. This response to the COVID-19 nursing home crisis had a number of different phases with steps that are also seen in other healthcare system responses (Figure 1; Kim et al., 2020; Stall et al., 2020). In the initial phase, interventions were set up (a) to create an easily accessible single point of contact (a contact centre) where all questions and needs were collected and monitored, (b) to gain insight into the specific characteristics of the nursing homes (such as numbers of residents and staff, and of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases, and the existing support from other healthcare organisations), and (c) to detect any lack in resources and equipment (including personal protective equipment and testing material) or in the clinical expertise needed to manage outbreaks.The second phase involved an assessment of the specific situation for each nursing home: an immediate response to prevent the further spread of the virus. Between April 10 and May 29, a total of 26 hospital nurses from staff and management were employed in eight care homes. These provided support for several weeks in the regular and cohort wards, based on the expertise they had gained in the hospital. In addition, several workplace visits were performed by staff members with clinical expertise in infectious diseases, geriatricians and psychologists. The purpose of these visits was to obtain the information needed to tailor existing procedures to the nursing home context and its specific population. Depending on the situation of the individual residential care centre, this could involve architectural advice, treatment of laundry, infection prevention training and testing protocols.",

Maybe that's the question-the last one-before we breathe our last breath.'' Achile Mbembe (2020) At the time of writing this editorial, more than 13 million people have been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in the world, more than half a million have died, and the transmission does not reach its peak (WHO 2020). Latin America and the United States are the current epicentre of the pandemic today. Once again, a catastrophic fact shows us the fragility of human life. This pandemic, coupled with climate change, reminds us that we cannot continue believing and acting as if human beings were out of nature, and that nature is a storehouse of unlimited resources that some can harness more than others.",

Thus, its negative consequences are most acutely borne by populations facing a greater social, economic, and political disadvantage. Hence reproducing in this pandemic historical socio-sanitary inequities. It is only enough to see what is happening with the sick and dead from COVID-19 in Brazil, or with black and indigenous populations with historically precarious living conditions in Colombia, or with Latinos and immigrants in the United States; all of them are less likely to face the pandemic today and in the future. Oxfam (2019) estimated that billionaires had increased their wealth by US$ 2.5 billion a day, while the poorest half of the world's population had reduced it by 11%. This huge concentration of wealth is, in part, the result of an increase in job precariousness, which leads to precarious lives and a new social class: the precarious.",

However, the neoliberal onslaught of health systems has been difficult to break. Therefore, returning to a ''normality'' cannot be what we yearn for. It is precisely that ''normality'' which imposes us restrictions on a life worth living. The discourse of the return to ''normality'' must be confronted with an emancipatory praxis. There is an urgent need to focus politics on protecting life on the planet for the present and future generations, recovering solidary, popular, and barter economies, transforming ways of making nature a constitutive part, in order to guarantee decent living conditions for all people, and to strengthen democracy.",

The papers reflect the particular dimensions of this complex relationship and show the vulnerability of health systems to market influence by calling for an ethical approach to the commercial determinants of health, by revealing the strategies of the food industry to influence public health decisions in Mexico or South Africa, or by questioning researchers on their sources of research funding. If this pandemic has taught us anything, it is that public health needs cooperation, social solidarity, state responsibility, and strong democracies. This special issue draws attention to the fact that the health of populations cannot depend on market-driven forces because these have left behind millions of people who are now in precarious conditions to face this emergency.",

Since the beginning of the pandemic, governmental agencies around the world, nonprofit organizations, and various vaccine developers have committed vast resources to COVID-19 vaccine development. Despite the high speed, safety standards for the development and approval process of the recently available vaccines were consistent with those for previous vaccines, with rigorous review of their clinical data by government regulatory agencies and external review panels such as the U.S. Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). 13 Many COVID-19 candidate vaccines were designed to use the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) or part of it as the immunogen, an agent capable of inducing immune responses. The S protein is the viral surface protein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein receptor on the surface of human cells that mediates entrance of the virus into the human cells. The S protein, with a total of 1273 amino acids, consists of two major regions: the S1 and S2 domains. The S1 domain, where the receptor-binding domain (RBD) resides, is responsible for the binding of S protein with the ACE2 receptor. 14, 15 The use of S protein as the immunogen was supported by evidence from previous SARS and MERS vaccine development; vaccines that can induce strong antibody responses against the S protein often have a significant effect on blocking viral entry into host cells during natural infection. 16 This observation was further validated in studies in which most of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent patients were against either the S protein or its RBD domain. 15, 16 Previous research experience with SARS and MERS coronaviruses identified two proline substitutions on S protein, which stabilize the antigenically optimal prefusion conformation of this protein and were employed in the COVID-19 vaccine design. 17, 18 The prior vaccine research with SARS and MERS also helped establish suitable animal models for vaccine efficacy testing. 19, 20 Technologies for mRNA and vector vaccines allowed researchers to precisely design the antigen yet avoid complicated protein purification steps and a high-risk viral culture process. 21 In this report, we first provide an overview of the vaccine development landscape with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of different vaccine platforms. We then focus on vaccine adjuvants as well as nanotechnology in vaccine delivery systems, as both are relatively underdeveloped areas. Lastly, we analyze the research trends in published documents related to COVID-19 vaccine development and provide a landscape of these documents with highlights on the most notable journal articles. We hope this report can serve as a useful resource for people who want to get a quick understanding of the technologies involved in COVID-19 vaccines, as well as an appreciation of the global effort of COVID-19 vaccine development.",

In addition, the United States and China have the highest numbers of vaccines in clinical trials, and they both cover a diverse range of platforms, although no live attenuated or inactivated vaccine is being developed in the United States.

South Korea and Canada seem to have devoted their efforts to developing protein subunit-, viral vector-, and DNA-based vaccines, although these are still in early clinical trial stages.

            "text": "Conventional whole virus vaccines, including live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines, are the oldest and most well-established types of vaccine, used in smallpox, BCG, and measles vaccines. In the case of vaccines developed against COVID-19, the attenuated or inactivated whole SARS-CoV-2 virus is administered to individuals to elicit the immune responses. The immune responses are likely to target not only the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, but also many other viral proteins. Manufacturing of these COVID-19 vaccines is more time-consuming and difficult because it takes time to grow the virus into large quantities and requires dedicated biosafety level 3 production facilities. 23 3.1.1. Live-Attenuated Vaccines. Live-attenuated vaccines are traditionally produced by serial passage of diseaseproducing viruses in cultured cells with selection for a weakened replication capability and thus reduced virulence. The virulence of viruses in live-attenuated vaccines is reduced, but the viruses still retain the ability to replicate. These vaccines usually produce strong and long-lasting antibody-mediated (humoral) and cell-mediated immune responses by mimicking natural infection, but extensive safety evaluation is required. Although live-attenuated viral vaccines do not normally cause disease, they are rarely used in immunocompromised patients because of the possibility of infection by the live viruses in the vaccine. Interestingly, a live-attenuated candidate vaccine against COVID-19 was developed via codon deoptimization by Codagenix/Serum Institute of India. It has entered into Phase 1 clinical evaluation with a single dose administered intranasally (Table 2) . 24 Four other candidates are undergoing preclinical studies. However, it is worth noting that concerns have been raised that such vaccines may revert to virulence in some cases. 25 3.1.2. Inactivated Vaccines. Inactivated vaccines, also called killed vaccines, are produced by first growing the virus in a culture medium and then inactivating it by treatment with (Table 2 ). For example, CoronaVac from Sinovac was developed with \u03b2-propiolactone as an inactivating agent and formulated with aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant (more details in the adjuvant section). With encouraging safety and immunogenicity results from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, 26 this vaccine has achieved an overall efficacy of 50.7% in the Phase 3 trial and has received conditional marketing authorization (CMA) in China. 27, 28 Another vaccine, BBIBP-CorV produced by Sinopharm in China, exhibited satisfactory early clinical trial results and has transitioned into Phase 3 clinical trials. 29 It has been reported to have a 79.3% efficacy and has received CMA approval in China. 30 BBV152 from Bharat Biotech is presently in a Phase 3 clinical trial and has received EUA in India. 31 3.2. Recombinant Viral Protein-Based Vaccines. Although the whole virus vaccines represent a well-established platform, they require stringent production standards and procedures.

Because it is inherently safe and uses well-established techniques of protein purification, these vaccines comprise the largest category in COVID-19 vaccine development, as shown in Figure 2 . Most of these vaccines utilize either the S protein or its receptorbinding domain (RBD) as the antigen. Because the S protein is membrane-bound with multiple subunits, the expression and production of the full-length S protein can be challenging. The RBD fragment, like the full-length S protein, elicits potent neutralizing antibodies and is much smaller and easier to produce. However, it lacks other potentially important epitopes presented by the full-length S protein. As a result, the RBD-based vaccines may not be as effective as the S protein-based vaccines. 23 Similar to inactivated vaccines, protein subunit vaccines elicit mainly antibody-mediated immunity with a weak induction of T-cell response. Adjuvants are usually needed for this type of vaccine to boost the immune response and enhance vaccine efficacy (more information in the adjuvant section).",

These particles are composed of viral capsid/coat proteins that, when recombinantly expressed from a host cell, can selfassemble into a capsid-like structure in the absence of the viral genome and other nonstructural virus proteins. As such, these noninfective particles provide a scaffold onto which multiple copies of an antigen (or epitope) can be chemically coupled or arrayed. This clustering of antigens/epitopes on the VLP surface allows for enhanced cognate activation of B-cells and antibody responses. 36 Of the two COVID-19 VLP vaccine candidates in clinical evaluation, one is a vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 from Medicago Inc., and the other is from SpyBiotech/Serum Institute of India (Table 3) .",

In contrast to conventional whole virus vaccines and protein-based vaccines that directly introduce antigenic proteins to stimulate host immune responses, vector vaccines use nonpathogenic viral vectors to deliver antigen-coding DNA fragments to host cells for expression of the antigen using cellular protein-making machinery. The decision to use a particular viral vector initially depends on the size (in base pairs) of the antigen gene to be inserted as some viral vectors are more accommodating than others. There are also concerns as to pre-existing immunity and safety in the target population as well as genetic stability of the vector and issues related to manufacturing. 37 They can be broadly divided into two types: nonreplicating viral vector vaccines and replicating viral vector vaccines. Because viral vector vaccines result in endogenous antigen production, they are more likely to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. Viral vector vaccines can be developed and produced quickly on a large scale and do not require very low temperatures for transportation and storage. However, pre-existing immunity to the vector can limit the ability of the vector to deliver genetic material to host cells and thus reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine.",

Many of them use genetically modified adenoviral (Ad) vectors that are unable to replicate in the human body. This is typically achieved by deletion of a gene within the vector that encodes a viral structural protein, thus preventing virion assembly in an infected cell. Assembly of the vaccine vector requires providing the missing structural protein through use of a helper virus or a transgenic host cell.

DNA vaccines use plasmid DNA containing a mammalian expression promoter and a transgene encoding the protein antigen, such as S protein in the case of COVID-19 vaccines. They are easy to produce in vitro and are very stable at room temperature, which simplifies the storage and distribution of this type of vaccine and may be more practical for use in endemic areas of developing countries. 52 The platform can also be easily adapted to produce a new vaccine for another antigen. In early clinical studies, DNA vaccines are associated with low immunogenicity when they were delivered by traditional needle injection without the use of adjuvants or other delivery instruments. 53 To compensate, physical delivery devices such as electroporators or gene guns, have been introduced during vaccination to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. 54 No DNA vaccine has yet been approved, but 11 candidates against COVID-19 are in clinical trials ( Table 5 ). The intradermally delivered DNA The mRNA vaccines are comprised of mRNA carrying the genetic instruction of the protein antigens with the mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Upon vaccination, LNP-mRNA is delivered to the cytosol of the host cells and the mRNA is subsequently used as a template for protein antigen synthesis. In many COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidates, the genetic code of the full-length S protein is delivered and translated into S protein using the host cells' protein-making machinery within the cytosol. 57\u221259 Analogous to the vector vaccines and DNA vaccines, the mRNA vaccines also have the capability to induce both antibody production and T-cell responses, since the protein antigen is produced in the cells of the vaccinated person. In addition, antigen expression after mRNA vaccination is transient, limiting its persistence in the body. These features suggest that mRNA can be a fast, safe, and efficient platform for vaccine development. 21 Currently, two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer/ BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273), have been conditionally approved in multiple countries. Six more vaccines are undergoing clinical evaluation (Table 5) . Remarkably, it took Moderna only 2 months since the release of the viral genomic sequence to develop mRNA-1273 for clinical trial. In July 2020, the company confirmed its safety and protective immune response after the conclusion of the Phase 1 trial. 57 Meanwhile, Pfizer/BioNTech confirmed BNT162b2 safety and immunogenicity data from a Phase 1 trial and moved this vaccine to a Phase 2/3 trial. 60 In November, both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech announced excellent results for their mRNA vaccines' efficacy (94.1% 61 and 95%, 62 respectively) and safety from their Phase 3 trials. In addition, Moderna's vaccine exhibited 100% efficacy against severe COVID-19. 63 Given the unstable nature of RNA molecules, some mRNA candidates require strict cold chain management for distribution and storage. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines require storage at \u221270\u00b0C 64 and \u221220\u00b0C, respectively. However, the German company CureVac announced that their mRNA vaccine candidate CVnCOV, currently in Phase 2 study, is stable for three months at 5\u00b0C. 65 In addition, Arcturus Therapeutics has developed a single-dose, self-amplifying mRNA vaccine, ARCT-021, that can be stored at a normal refrigerator temperature as a freeze-dried formulation. 66 3.5. Summary of the Most Promising COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates. Table 6 summarizes the key features of selected vaccine candidates that, with the exception of NVX-CoV2373, have been conditionally approved by at least one country. Interestingly, the vaccine platforms for these vaccines include only mRNA, nonreplicating viral vector, inactivated, and protein subunit. All these need to be administered via intramuscular injections. Whereas most listed vaccines require two doses, the viral vector-based vaccines developed by Johnson & Johnson and CanSino Biologics need only one dose. Although mRNA vaccines were the first kind to be conditionally approved, their stringent temperature storage condition limits the deployment of these vaccines in rural or undeveloped areas. All other types of vaccines have relatively permissive temperature requirements, which allow them an easier deployment process in less developed areas.",

Adjuvants contribute to the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of vaccines by decreasing the amount of antigen required to elicit a durable immune response, eliciting an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine milieu, and polarizing the helper T-cell response along type 1 vs type 2 differentiation pathways. They are mostly used for protein subunit vaccines. The mechanisms by which these occur are not yet elaborated but are generally recognized to involve a promotion of antigen uptake, an increase in antigen presentation, recruitment of immune cells, and stimulation of the innate immune system via Toll-like receptors that function as a warning system against microbial infection. The adjuvants utilized in most vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, are shown in Table 7 . The adjuvants of Table 7 represent traditional and wellestablished agents. However, many natural products (e.g., polysaccharides, \u03b1-galactosylceramide), 67 endogenous cytokines (e.g., interleukins, interferons, GM-CSF), 68 and synthetic compounds (e.g., saponin derivatives) 69 have been examined in preclinical and experimental settings. As the molecular pathways underlying the effects of these adjuvants have been investigated, it has become clearer that the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) system of the innate immune system is targeted by many of these agents.",

Modifications of IVT mRNA Sequences to Enhance the Functionality of mRNA Vaccines. Many strategies have been introduced to optimize mRNA sequences to increase their stability and translational efficiency and to minimize intrinsic immunogenicity. Like mammalian mRNA, mRNA vaccines produced by in vitro transcription (IVT) contain an open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs), a 5\u2032-cap, and a 3\u2032 polyadenylation (poly(A)) tail, as shown in Figure 5 . The cap, poly (A) tail, and UTRs are crucial for ribosome-mediated translation and stability of mRNA.",

The process of 5\u2032 capping is crucial for initiation of mRNA translation. 77,78 Indeed, mRNA cap analogues have been explored and developed to increase the stability and translational efficiency of mRNA vaccines. In addition, without a cap, the IVT mRNA would be recognized as foreign RNA by the host immune system through a mechanism mediated by Toll-like receptors 7/8. 79 Capping of IVT mRNA would prevent its recognition by the host immune system and reduce immunogenicity caused by mRNA molecule itself. 77, 80 The elongated poly (A) tail at the 3\u2032 end is important for the stability and subsequent translation of mRNA. 81 Incorporation of UTR sequences enhances mRNA half-life and translation efficiency. 82 For example, incorporating a human \u03b2-globin UTR to both 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-UTR of the mRNA has been shown to enhance the stability and translational efficiency, 83 whereas insertion of an \u03b1-globin UTR to the 3\u2032-UTR region increased the mRNA stability. 84 Both 3\u2032-and 5\u2032-UTR regions can also inhibit decapping and degradation of mRNA. 83, 84 As such, sequence modifications in both 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-UTRs have been explored to enhance the mRNA vaccine functionality. 85 In addition, unmodified IVT mRNA sequences can stimulate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activate the innate immune system. 86 To reduce immunogenicity of the IVT mRNA, a variety of modified nucleotides have been introduced into the ORF region. 86, 87 For instance, designed incorporation of pseudouridine (\u03c8) (Figure 6 ) has been shown to reduce immunogenicity and improve translation. 88 Additionally, mRNA containing N1-methyl-pseudouridine (m1\u03c8) (Figure 6 ) exhibited an increase in translational efficiency. 89 Recent studies have shown that this increase is related to N1-methyl-pseudouridine induced enhancement of ribosome recycling to the same mRNA. 90 Aside from the nucleotide modifications, optimizing the codons with GC-rich sequences may also reduce mRNA immunogenicity. 91 In an erythropoietin production model without chemical modification, the ORF of mRNA was engineered by adapting GC-rich codons used for each amino acid. The result showed GC-enriched mRNA may achieve meaningful biological effects without causing inappropriate immunostimulation. 91 4.3. Nanoparticle-Based Delivery Vehicles for COVID- 19 Vaccines. Recent progress in nanotechnology has significantly advanced the development of novel vaccine delivery systems and adjuvants. A major challenge in successfully achieving the full potential of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics is ensuring their efficient delivery. The physicochemical features of nucleic acids, such as negative charge and hydrophilicity, impede passive diffusion across the plasma membrane. Additionally, a series of barriers, such as association with serum proteins, uptake by phagocytes, and degradation by endogenous nucleases, obstruct efficient delivery of nucleic acids. Thus, they require a delivery vehicle for efficient cellular uptake and degradation protection.",

            "text": "Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines are formulated with lipid nanoparticles as the delivery vehicle for the mRNA, with formulations including ionizable cationic lipid. Lipid nanoparticles comprising synthetic cationic lipids, which form nanoscale complexes with polyanionic nucleic acids, are presently the most widely used nonviral nucleic acid carriers. Draped by positively charged lipids, the mRNA is more stable and resilient to RNase degradation and forms selfassembled nanoparticles (Figure 7) . Once endocytosed, the lipid nanoparticles escape the endosomes and deliver their cargo in the cytosol, where the mRNA is translated into antigenic proteins, prompting the immune system to produce antibodies. Thus, the basic steps of the nucleic acid delivery include (i) adsorption and endocytosis of lipid nanoparticles inside the cell, followed by (ii) release of the nucleic acid. The lipid nanoparticles' adsorption and fusion with the cell membrane is electrostatically promoted since the biomembranes commonly bear a negative charge. The unbinding of the nucleic acid from a cationic lipid carrier when the nanoparticles get inside the cell has been identified as one of the key steps in the nucleic acid delivery. It is supposedly a result of charge neutralization by the cellular anionic lipids, which triggers unbinding of nucleic acid from nanoparticle carriers in two distinct ways: by neutralizing cationic lipid charge, thus eliminating the nucleic acid\u2212lipid electrostatic attraction and by disruption of the nanoparticle architecture and formation of nonlamellar structures. It has been suggested that the delivery efficacy of the cationic lipids correlates with their ability to modulate the phase behavior of the biomembrane lipids, specifically to induce formation of nonlamellar lipid phases. 92, 93 The compositions of the lipid nanoparticles of the Pfizer/ BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines are similar: ionizable cationic lipid, PEGylated lipid, cholesterol, and the phospholipid distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) as a helper lipid, 11,12,94\u221296 as shown in Figure 7 . Cationic lipids, as mentioned above, are key components in the nucleic acid nonviral drug delivery vehicles as they form complexes with the anionic nucleic acids. PEGylated lipids confer longer systemic circulation of the vehicles by reducing uptake by the macrophages (\"stealth\" liposomes). Cholesterol and phosphatidylcholines are common biomembrane components and are the most widely used constituents of the lipid drug delivery systems.",

This system was used to prepare multimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD nanoparticles that elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies. 109, 111, 112 Another kind of nanoparticle vaccine was produced using self-assembling ferritin nanoparticles to display SARS-CoV-2 S protein or its subunits. 113, 114 This type of vaccine may prompt robust neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses in animal models.

            "text": "At the beginning of the pandemic, researchers noticed correlations between COVID-19 severity and morbidity and the status of previous vaccinations. As Figure 9 shows, there is a significant number of publications regarding vaccine crossprotection. According to a Mayo Clinic research study, various vaccines, from influenza to measles, etc., appear to provide partial protection against COVID-19. 115 The exact mechanisms underlying the beneficial off-target effects of the vaccines are not well understood, but it is believed that vaccines induce metabolic and epigenetic changes that enhance the innate immune response to infections, a process termed trained immunity. 116, 117 Those documents related to COVID-19 cross-protection by other vaccines, as shown in Figure 9 , were further analyzed to illustrate the distribution of publications per existing vaccines ( Figure 11 ). Bacillus Calmette\u2212Gue\u0155in (BCG) is a live-attenuated vaccine against tuberculosis. Epidemiological analyses have suggested a negative association between national BCG vaccination programs and the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 disease. 118\u2212120 Analysis of the CAS content collection identified 212 documents indicating a possible epidemiological correlation. More than half of these documents suggest that routine BCG immunization programs correlate with lower case fatality rates for COVID-19, while 36 documents assert there is no such correlation. It is noteworthy that virtually all documents, even those advocating the ability of BCG to confer protection against COVID-19, emphasize that convincing proof from extensive preclinical and clinical studies is required. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines may have a beneficial effect in minimizing the severity of COVID-19. 121\u2212124 It has been suggested that influenza vaccination could act as a nonspecific immunity stimulator in patients with COVID-19 leading to early activation of the immune system to attack SARS-CoV-2 before it invades cells. Here again, more than half of the documents discussing the relation of influenza vaccine and COVID-19 disease severity ascertain a positive effect. Further studies are needed to advance our understanding of the role of influenza vaccines in controlling the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence indicates that countries with recent vaccination campaigns against MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) have fewer COVID-19 deaths. 125 Sequence homology has been identified between the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein and both the measles virus fusion (F1) glycoprotein and the rubella virus envelope (E1) glycoprotein, suggesting that the MMR vaccine may mitigate COVID-19 spread and severity. 125, 126 Although several COVID-19 vaccines have already been approved, the accumulated evidence suggests that vaccines can have cross-protective effects on unrelated infections and diseases as additional routes to prevent and reduce the spread of diseases in the future. This could also buy time for targeted vaccines or effective therapies to be developed or identified. In addition, exploring the mechanism of cross-protection may provide valuable information on the molecular bases of diseases. Previous studies have shown that RNA viruses, especially those responsible for respiratory diseases, pose a significant threat to global health. 127 The spread of these RNA viruses among the population may select for mutations that change these viruses' pathogenesis, virulence, and transmissibility, or a combination of these. 128 As Figure 9 shows, there are a significant number of publications regarding SARS-CoV-2 mutations in the context of vaccine development. It is not surprising to see that this virus, after over a year circulating in the global population, has accumulated mutations that have produced several variants with stronger transmissibility and possibly altered S protein antigen. Most of the leading COVID-19 vaccines, including those from Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax, were developed based on the genetic sequence of the prototype S protein published in January 2020, with minimal amino acid substitutions for conformation stabilization and establishing protease resistance. 33,57,58,60,106,129\u2212136 Studies have shown that the variant that emerged in early 2020 with the D614G mutation was recognizable by the antibodies elicited by mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna. 106 In addition, three recently emerged variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1) associated with D614G mutation have raised concerns about the effectiveness of certain approved COVID-19 vaccines. The B.1.1.7 variant, also known as 501Y.V1 with key mutations of N501Y, A570D, D614G, and P681H, emerged in September 2020 in southeast England. Because of its enhanced transmissibility and possibly higher virulence, this variant quickly dominated the UK and has spread to more than 50 countries. 137\u2212140 Although this new variant has accumulated several mutations on the S protein, including the most significant N501Y mutation, recent studies demonstrated that sera obtained from individuals vaccinated with mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 showed similar neutralizing activities against B.1.1.7 variant when compared to the wild type form. 141 The B.1.351 variant, also known as 501Y.V2, with key mutations of K417N, E484K, N501Y, and D614G, emerged in late 2020 in South Africa, and since then has become the dominant variant locally. 140 A recent study showed that the two leading mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2) may not have comparable effectiveness to this variant as compared to the wild type form. 141 Further studies showed that the E484K mutation acquired by this variant on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein may be the major contributor of the antigenic change leading to the loss of neutralizing activity of the current leading vaccines. 141 Another variant, known as P.1 or 501Y.V3, with key mutations of K417N/T, E484K, N501Y, and D614G, is rapidly emerging in Brazil and contains the similar key mutations to the B.1.351 variant. 142, 143 It is anticipated that this variant may escape the protective effects of the leading mRNA vaccines like the B.1.351 variant. 141 Interestingly, recent studies done in South Africa suggested that the antibody response in patients infected with B.1.135 variant has a broad specificity and that vaccines designed with this variant sequence may elicit more cross-reactive responses. 144 To cope with the mutations accumulated on the S protein, several leading vaccine developers are already in the process of The New England Journal of Medicine (December 10, 2020) result from a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded clinical trial for a two-dose regimen of BNT162b2",

Within one year of the outbreak of this disease, many COVID-19 vaccine initiatives are underway worldwide, and more than 70 vaccines have proceeded into clinical trials. A few of these have obtained conditional approval, and more hold the promise to gain such approval in 2021. Whereas many vaccines under development use traditional approaches, several innovative technologies, such as mRNA vaccines and nonreplicating adenovirus vaccines, have quickly risen to a prominent position by leading the race for mass production and distribution and securing conditional approvals. Such achievements can be attributed collectively to decades of pioneering research, timely sharing of the critical information about the virus genome, heightened collaboration among various research entities including universities and pharmaceutical/biotech companies, increased governmental support, and most importantly, the tireless Despite such remarkable progress in COVID-19 vaccine development, many issues remain to be addressed. 163 Although clinical trial data have shown that the COVID-19 vaccines approved so far are able to elicit immunity with a high degree of efficacy, it is not yet known how durable the immunity will be. A recently published study examining multiple components of adaptive immunity in COVID-19 infection cases indicated that SARS-CoV-2 immunity may last at least 8 months following symptom onset. 157 On the other hand, a modeling study predicts decay of neutralization titer over the first 250 days after immunization with seven conditionally approved vaccines, although protection from severe disease may be retained. 164 More longitudinal studies of immune responses following vaccination will be needed to provide a more definitive answer. 165 Since deployment, COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated protection in vaccinated individuals against the development of COVID-19.",

            "text": "Recently released data strongly suggest that certain vaccines can also prevent asymptomatic infection in most cases. 166 Finally, mutations of SARS-CoV-2 S protein have been reported, and some variants that bear these mutations may be more infectious or resistant to neutralizing antibodies. 141, 167, 168 Thus, how mutations and the resultant variants would affect the effectiveness of vaccines is a critical issue. Studies addressing this issue have been reported. For example, clinical studies of Johnson & Johnson's JNJ-78436735 vaccine showed an efficacy of 57% in South Africa where most of the COVID-19 cases were caused by the B.1.351 variant. 39 The Novavax vaccine NVX-CoV2373 appeared to have an overall efficacy of 48.6% against key variants, of which the B.1.351 variant was the predominant form. 34 In addition, a recently published paper reported that the AstraZeneca/Oxford University ADZ1222 vaccine exhibited only 10.4% efficacy against the B.1.351 variant. 169 It is encouraging to know that both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have developed variant B.1.351-specific vaccines which will be tested in clinical trials as booster shots of their variant-specific vaccines. 170, 171 It is also encouraging that the COVID-19 vaccine pipeline currently features many platforms. Despite high efficacy and relative ease in mass production of mRNA vaccines, the two leading mRNA vaccines still need to be stored and transported at stringent temperatures. This requirement may prevent effective distribution of such vaccines to less developed areas where specialized freezers may not be readily available. Thus, vaccines based on other types of platforms that do not need such stringent storage and transportation conditions are still very much needed. Also, most of the leading vaccines require a booster shot, and therefore effective administration procedures need to be in place to ensure that correct booster shot schedules are followed for widespread vaccination to be accomplished. Vaccines that can elicit durable immunity with a single dose may offer logistical advantages and be more easily adopted in some parts of the world.",

The nonreplicating viral vector, mRNA, DNA, replicating viral vector, and inactivated vaccines account for 13.3%, 12.1%, 10.2%, 9.8%, and 8.2%, respectively.Figure 3 lists the top seven countries according to the number of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in clinical trial. The United States, China, the UK, and Germany have the vaccines in the most advanced clinical trial stage, Phase 4 (post market studies). Individual vaccines as represented by colored dots showing the stages of clinical trials are displayed among different vaccine platforms by country. India is the only country where a live-attenuated COVID-19 vaccine is being developed. China, India, and the UK each has inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidates.

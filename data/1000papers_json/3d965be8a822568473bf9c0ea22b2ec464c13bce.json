The aromatic Louisiana Clearfield Jazzman (CJ) and Thai Jasmine (TJ), and a non-aromatic parboiled (PB) rice were hydrated during the first 10 min of processing with reciprocal agitation followed by static retort processing. The aroma compound, 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) was more heat-stable in CJ than TJ rice but decreased 15-fold compared to the rice cooker method. Pareto analysis indicated that rice type and agitation had the main effect on amylose and total starch and chroma and hue. Color differences of rice agitated during hydration and between rice cooker or static retort processed rice, indicated only slight differences for each rice variety. Hydration of dry rice during retort cooking and similar starch, color, and aroma quality were achieved with reciprocal compared to static or rice cooker methods. Survey responses categorized consumers into three, mindsets driven by rice consumption, convenience, or packaging.",

New main dishes and cuisine pairings that feature diverse cuisines offer the opportunity to catalyze the growth of the stagnant rice market if healthier attributes are leveraged. In the U.S. and worldwide, cooking behavior dramatically shifted during the Covid-19 pandemic and consumers made meals from scratch (49%), used precooked and packaged foods (46%), were willing to spend 15-30 min (46%) or 30-60 min (44%) to cook, and ate meals immediately (84%) [17] .

Ready-to-eat rice presents a food engineering challenge due to hydration and gelatinization properties. A second challenge to the successful adoption of ready-to-eat rice is the lack of knowledge on consumer mindsets about ready-to-eat rice. Conjoint analysis is a statistical tool to identify aspects of a topic that drives consumer interest and how consumers vary in response to the topic [27] . The conjoint analysis identified consumer mindsets and messaging for insect-based protein [27] , effective food safety educational programs [28] , messaging to increase fruit and vegetable consumption [29] , and messaging to identify acceptable healthier fried chicken alternatives [30] . The objectives of this study were to determine the potential benefit of reciprocal agitation on heat penetration and rice quality, using semi-rigid plastic retort trays with three rice varieties-Clearfield Jazzman CLJ01 (CJ), Thai Jasmine (TJ), and parboiled (PB) rice-to identify consumer segments and drivers around cooking methods, rice use, packaging types, and convenience. The results have an application to improvement in the technology to improve the quality of ready-to-eat rice and to develop strategies to identify key variables relevant to consumers' preferences for healthier food. the CJ rice, and PB and TJ rice were purchased from a local grocery store. An aliquot of 128 g (\u00b11 g) dry rice was added to a rigid Silgan package (inner dimensions: 12.5 \u00d7 9.5 \u00d7 3 cm; Woodland Hills, CA, USA). An aliquot of 141 g (\u00b11 g) of deionized water was added and packages were sealed with a semi-automatic Control GMC PL200G (Boucherville, QC, Canada), using Bemis retort grade L7288 film (Neenah, WI, USA). The settings included a heat seal of 204 \u2022 C, a film length of 15.2 cm, a nitrogen gas flush duration of 1.5 s, and a gas pressure of 241 kPa.

The heat penetration profile with reciprocal agitation of 45, 90, and 130 SPM for CJ rice showed that with increasing reciprocal agitation, the temperature increased more rapidly with agitation during the 10 min hold for CJ rice (Figure 2A-C) . A similar trend was observed for TJ and PB rice (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ). The retort temperature was held at 60 \u2022 C, a temperature lower than gelatinization, with reciprocal agitation to enhance hydration prior to gelatinization and potentially shorten the processing time.

Heat transfer was not improved if reciprocal agitation was continued during the cook and cool.

See bolded values that highlight significant differences. The amylose content of CJ-0 and CJ-45 was not significantly different from CJ-RC. Amylose content in the current study was higher than the value of 12.8 g/100 g amylose for CJ [36] . Amylose content of TJ or PB retort processed rice was not different from the control rice cooker rice ( Table 2 ). The amylose content of uncooked CJ, TJ, and PB rice was 14, 17, and 36 g/100 g, respectively. Cooking rice resulted in an increase in amylose for all cook processes for all rice. Retorted TJ rice and PB rice, purchased at a retailer, had an amylose content of 34 g/100 g and 36 g/100 g, respectively, and was within the range of this study. For each rice type, the resistant starch, non-resistant starch, and the sum were not significantly different. The starch analysis suggests a minimal effect on starch composition by retort processing compared to electric rice cooker prepared rice. PB rice had consistently higher values for resistant starch than CJ or TJ rice. In the direct measure of total starch (TS), there was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in total starch in PB-130 relative to PB-RC. Overall, the resistant starch values between 1.29 and 1.87 g/100 g, were slightly lower in the current study than reported for retort processed brown rice of 2.03 and 2.54 g/100 g [13] . Increased resistant starch was attributed to the hydrothermal process and pre-gelatinization of starch [37] . The direct measure of total starch of most rice ranged between 60 and 72 g/100 g. The sum of resistant starch and non-resistant starch closely approximated the empirical measure of total starch within 10 g/100 g, with an exception for CJ-0, PB-130, and PB-45 rice with no discernible trend.",

Greater 2-AP retention suggests a more buttery popcorn aroma profile [40] . The aroma of rice is a particularly important quality attribute and increasingly popular with consumers and part of the local and national identity [16] , but the volatile aroma compound, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP), is heat-sensitive [39] .",

Collective changes in L*, a*, and b* can be used to estimate h*, the color perceived by the consumer and C, the saturation of color. The h* and C values for CJ rice were not significantly affected by the cooking method. The h* and C values of TJ rice showed that retort cooking and agitation decreased h* and increased C (p < 0.05) (Table 3) . Likewise, h* and C of PB rice showed a significant decrease in h* and an increase in C at intermediate to high agitation speeds. TJ rice was the only rice with significantly lower saturation C values for rice cooker than any retort cooked rice ( Table 3 ). The higher b* values in retort cooked TJ likely account for lower C values. Higher b* values indicate a shift towards the yellow from the blue quadrant in the color diagram, resulting from the more severe thermal treatment of the retort and differences in perception of color or colorant compounds in retort cooked rice.",

The plot of the main effect showed that the agitation effect was almost parallel with the X-axis, indicating minimal impact and supported that rice type was the main effect for C ( Figure 4C ) and h* ( Figure 4C ). The aromatic rice, CJ and TJ, had negative a* and h* values. Since PB rice and aromatic rice cross quadrant boundaries, measuring the relationship between variables is not practical [41] . However, the aromatic rice (CJ and TJ) were close in the pure spectrum of color. The \u2206E RC values are shown for rice cooked in the retort relative to rice cooked in an electric cooker and \u2206E SPM values of rice cooked by retort with agitation relative to rice cooked with a static process ( Table 3 ). The \u2206E RC values for CJ rice relative to the electric rice cooker ranged between 4.1 and 4.7.

The greater the \u2206E values, the greater the difference in perception of color. The \u2206E value of 2.0 or less is considered the threshold for perception of color differences to consumers; tolerance for instrumental color differences may be established by calibration against a standard, but \u2206E values between 2 and 10 are considered perceptible at a glance [42] .",

            "text": "In this study, feasibility was demonstrated for the preparation of quality, ready-to-eat aromatic rice without previous cooking or hydration using reciprocal agitation retort processing. Dry rice was hydrated and retort processed within the sealed package. Reciprocal agitation decreased the temperature differential between retort and product temperatures during the hydration step at 60 \u2022 C and temperature differential varied with reciprocal agitation speed and rice type. Reciprocal agitation facilitated in-package hydration and maintained rice quality. Further optimization of hydration conditions, specific to rice cultivars, would likely improve the uniformity of hydration, gelatinization, and eating quality of retort rice. An additional limitation of the study is the absence of an evaluation of the textural quality of the retorted rice. Instrumental and sensory assessment of texture is needed for the full application of the technology. Cultural and regional preference must be identified that influence liking of rice textures from sticky to individual kernel. The aroma of CJ and TJ rice was adversely affected by retort processing. Minimal changes in quality of starch physico-chemical characteristics or color attributes were observed for retort processed rice relative to electric rice cooker rice. The concept of ready to heat and eat rice is not new. Mind Genomics addresses the issue of understanding specific messages, ideas, and communication which interest the respondent. Mind Genomics indicates that consumers distribute into groups embracing traditional methods of cooking rice, easy meals, or driven by packaging and not the rice product. Awareness of drivers and detractors of consumer choice of processed foods, assist in the further development of viable, innovations in thermal processing methods, packaging choices, and ready-to-eat food products. Development of long shelf life, high-quality foods that are part of a healthy diet addresses sustainable nutrition and food security.

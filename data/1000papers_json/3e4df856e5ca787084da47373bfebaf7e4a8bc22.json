Assuming that all these secondary cases were infected by their index cases, a realistic assumption given a time lag of symptom onset between them, we observed an SIR of 32.4% for RT-PCRconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 with 62.9% of households having one or more secondary cases. This SIR we observed is comparable to secondary attack rates from Wang et al (30%) [12] and Liu et al(35%) [13] , but it is substantially higher than data published by WHO (3-10%) [4] or those reported in Shenzhen, China (15%) [14] , or in the United States (10.5%) [15] . Several differences between our study and those published may have contributed to our higher SIR, including approaches of identifying or defining secondary cases, features of the cases investigated, environment and behavioral differences, and interventions for mitigating virus spread. Moreover, we systematically screened all household contacts (symptomatic or not) by laboratory testing and active follow-up, with respiratory specimens being collected at 3-7 days intervals. Another possible reason leading to overestimation of the SIR is that some of the infections in household contacts were acquired from outside the household or from second or higher cases. Any inferences about SIR must be made with caution owning to the fact that SIR within household changes with the varying probability of infection outside the household in our study. However, high SIR could be associated with the lack of preexisting immunity against this emerging virus.

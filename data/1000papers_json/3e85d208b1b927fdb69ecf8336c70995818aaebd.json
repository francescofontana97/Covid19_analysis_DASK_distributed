While reinforcement learning provides a powerful framework for acquiring individual behaviors, the time needed to acquire each skill makes the prospect of a generalist robot trained with RL daunting. In this paper, we study how a largescale collective robotic learning system can acquire a repertoire of behaviors simultaneously, sharing exploration, experience, and representations across tasks. In this framework new tasks can be continuously instantiated from previously learned tasks improving overall performance and capabilities of the system. To instantiate this system, we develop a scalable and intuitive framework for specifying new tasks through user-provided examples of desired outcomes, devise a multi-robot collective learning system for data collection that simultaneously collects experience for multiple tasks, and develop a scalable and generalizable multitask deep reinforcement learning method, which we call MT-Opt. We demonstrate how MT-Opt can learn a wide range of skills, including semantic picking (i.e., picking an object from a particular category), placing into various fixtures (e.g., placing a food item onto a plate), covering, aligning, and rearranging. We train and evaluate our system on a set of 12 real-world tasks with data collected from 7 robots, and demonstrate the performance of our system both in terms of its ability to generalize to structurally similar new tasks, and acquire distinct new tasks more quickly by leveraging past experience. We recommend viewing the videos at karolhausman.github.io/mt-opt",

While existing methods are effective and able to generalize, they require considerable on-robot training time, as well as extensive engineering effort for setting up each task and ensuring that the robot can attempt the task repeatedly. For example, the QT-Opt [36] system can learn vision-based robotic grasping, but it requires over 500, 000 trials collected across multiple robots. While such sample complexity may be reasonable if the robot needs to perform a single task, such as grasping objects from a bin, it becomes costly if we consider the prospect of training a general-purpose robot with a large repertoire of behaviors, where each behavior is learned in isolation, starting from scratch. Can we instead amortize the cost of learning this repertoire over multiple skills, where the effort needed to learn whole repertoire is reduced, easier skills serve to facilitate the acquisition of more complex ones, and data requirements, * Equal contribution Fig. 1 : A) Multi-task data collection.

            "text": "Prior work indicates that multi-task RL can indeed amortize the cost of single-task learning [20, 56, 60, 80, 30] . In particular, insofar as the tasks share common structure, if that structure can be discovered by the learning algorithm, all of the tasks can in principle be learned much more efficiently than learning each of the tasks individually. Such shared representations can include basic visual features, as well as more complex concepts, such as learning how to pick up objects. In addition, by collecting experience simultaneously using controllers for a variety of tasks with different difficulty, the easier tasks can serve to \"bootstrap\" the harder tasks. For example, the task of placing three food items on a plate may be difficult to complete if the reward is provided only at the end, but picking up a single food item is considerably easier. By learning these tasks together, the easier task serves to aid with exploration for the harder task. Finally, by enabling the multi-task RL policy to learn shared representations, learning new tasks can become easier over time as the system acquires more skills and learns more widely-useful aspects of the environment.",

First, multi-task reinforcement learning is known to be exceedingly difficult from the optimization standpoint, and the hypothesized benefits of multi-task learning have proven hard to realize due to these difficulties [64, 87] . Second, a real-world multi-task learning framework requires the ability to easily and intuitively define rewards for a large number of tasks. Third, while all taskspecific data could be shared between all the tasks, it has been shown that reusing data from non-correlated tasks can be harmful to the learning process [21] . Lastly, in order to receive the benefits from shared, multi-task representation, we need to significantly scale up our algorithms, the number of tasks in the environment, and the robotic systems themselves.",

            "text": "Combining multiple task policies has been explored in reinforcement learning by using gating networks [76, 50] , conditioning policies on tasks [15] , mapping tasks to parameters of a policy [13, 38, 82] , distilling separate task policies into a shared multi-task policy [40, 77, 62, 53, 27, 5] . In this work, we concentrate on directly learning a shared policy to take advantage of the shared structure which as we find in our experiments significantly improves the training efficiency. Advantages of multi-task learning for visual representations has been explored in [57] . Similar to our method, Pinto and Gupta [56] use a shared neural network architecture for multitask learning with shared visual layers and separate taskspecific layers that are trained with task-specific losses. In contrast, in our work, we concentrate on sparse-reward tasks with a common loss structure within a Q-learning framework. Several works explore how to mitigate multi-task interference and conflicting objectives when optimizing a single model for multiple tasks [31, 85] . In our experiments, we find that better data routing and grouping of tasks training data helps with not only better mitigating conflicting objectives but also improving learning efficiency through data reuse.",

A range of works employ various forms of autonomous supervision to learn diverse skills, e.g. by scaling up data collection [55] , sampling suitable tasks [68] or goals [51] to practice, learning a task embedding space amenable to sampling [30] , or learning a dynamics model and using modelpredictive control to achieve goals [23, 19, 42, 73] . Riedmiller et al. [60] learn sparse-reward tasks by solving easier auxiliary tasks and reusing that experience for off-line learning of more complex tasks. Their SAC-X framework shares data across tasks to learn and schedule many tasks, which eventually facilitate the complex task. In Cabi et al. [9] , previously collected experience is relabeled with new reward functions in order to solve new tasks using batch RL without re-collecting the data. In our work, we similarly design techniques for reusing experience between related tasks, which helps us to solve longhorizon problems and learn new tasks by training new success detectors without re-collecting the data. We expand on this direction by providing an in-depth analysis of various datasharing techniques and applying these techniques to a number of complex tasks and large-scale data collection on real robots.",

We devise a distributed, off-policy multitask reinforcement learning algorithm together with visual success detectors in order to learn multiple robotic manipulation tasks simultaneously. Visual success detectors are defined from video examples of desired outcomes and labelling prior episodes ( Fig. 2A) . These success detectors determine how episodes will be leveraged to train an RL policy (Fig. 2B) . During evaluation and fine-tuning (Fig. 2C ), at each time step, a policy takes as input a camera image and a one-hot encoding of the task, and sends a motor command to the robot. At the end of each episode, the outcome image of this process is graded by a multi-task visual success detector (SD) that determines which tasks were accomplished successfully and assigns a sparse reward 0 or 1 for each task. At the next step, the system decides whether another task should be attempted or if the environment should be reset. The abovedescribed setup can scale to multiple robots, where each robot concurrently collects data for a different, randomly-selected task. The generated episodes are used as offline data for training future policies (Fig. 2D) and are available to improve success detectors.",

The episode finishes when the policy selects a TERMINATE action or reaches a pre-defined maximum step limit.

For example tasks such as place-object-on-plate and placeobject-in-bowl belong to the same skill. Our impersonation function f Iskill allows us to impersonate an episode e (i) only as the tasks belonging to the same skill as T i . This strategy allows us to keep the benefits of data sharing via impersonation, while limiting the \"dilution\" issue. While in this work we manually decide on the task-skill grouping, this can be further extended by learning the impersonation function itself, which we leave as an avenue for future work.

We further highlight the imbalancing challenge in the Appendix, where Fig. 12 shows how much \"extra\" data is created per task thanks to the impersonation algorithm. In practice, this imbalance can severely hinder learning progress.

In this work, we aim to learn a discrete set of tasks that can be evaluated based only on the final image of an RL episode. This sparse-reward assumption allows us to train a neuralnetwork-based success detector model (SD), which given a final image, infers a probability of a task being successful. Similarly to policy learning, we take advantage of the multitask aspect of this problem and train a single multi-task success detector neural network that is conditioned on the task ID.

Over time, this allows us to start training an MT-Opt policy now for the harder tasks, and consequently, to collect better data for those tasks. To kick-start this process and bootstrap our two simplest tasks, we use two crude scripted policies for picking and placing (see Sec. X-B for details) following prior work [36] . In addition, in order to simplify the exploration problem for longer-horizon tasks, we also allow the individual tasks to be ordered sequentially, where one task is executed after another.

A wide range of manipulation behaviors fall into this category, from simple bin-picking to more complex behaviors, such as covering items with a cloth, placing noodles into a bowl, and inserting bottles into form-fitted slots. In the following experiments, we use a set of 12 tasks for quantitative evaluation of our algorithm. These 12 tasks include a set of plastic food objects and divided plate fixtures and they can be split into 'object acquisition' and 'object manipulation' skills. Our most general object acquisition task is lift-any, where the goal is to singulate and lift any object to a certain height. In addition, we define 7 semantic lifting tasks, where the goal is to search for and lift a particular object, such as a plastic carrot. The placing tasks utilize a divided plate where the simplest task is to place the previously lifted object anywhere on the plate (place-any). Harder tasks require placing the object into a particular section of a divided plate, which could be oriented arbitrarily. See Fig. 6 for a visualization of the tasks.",

The resulting policy is deployed on 7 robots attempting each task 100 times for evaluation. In order to further reduce the variance of the evaluation, we shuffle the bins after each episode and use a standard evaluation scene (see Appendix, Fig. 16) , from which all of the 12 evaluation tasks are feasible. Fig. 7 shows the success rates of MT-Opt on the 12 evaluation tasks. We compare the MT-Opt policy to three baselines: i) single-task QT-Opt [36] , where each per-task policy is trained separately using only data collected specifically for that task, ii) an enhanced QT-Opt baseline, which we call QT-Opt Multi-Task, where we train a shared policy for all the tasks but there is no data impersonation or re-balancing between the tasks, and iii) a Data-Sharing Multi-Task baseline that is based on the data-sharing strategy presented in [9] , where we also train a single Q-Function but the data is shared across all tasks. Looking at the average performance across all task, we observe that MT-Opt significantly outperforms the baselines, in some cases with \u2248 3\u00d7 average improvement. While the single task QT-Opt baseline performs similarly to MT-Opt for the task where we have the most data (see the data statistics in Fig. 5) , lift-any, its performance drastically drops (to \u2248 1%) for more difficult, underrepresented tasks, such as lift-can. Note, that we are not able run this baseline for the placing tasks, since they require a separate task to lift the object, which is not present in the single-task baseline. A similar observation applies to QT-Opt Multi-Task, where the performance of rare tasks increases compared to QT-Opt, but is still \u2248 4\u00d7 worse on average than MT-Opt. Sharing data across all tasks also results in a low performance for semantic lifting and placing tasks and, additionally, it appears to harm the performance of the indiscriminate lifting and placing tasks. The MT-Opt policy, besides attaining the 89% success rate on (lift-any), also performs the 7 semantic lifting tasks and the 4 placing and rearrangement tasks at a significantly higher success rate than all baselines. We explain these performance gaps by the way MT-Opt shares the representations and data, and provide a more comprehensive analysis of these factors in the following experiments. Due to the offline nature of the experiment, this comparison does not take into account the fact that the data for all tasks was collected using the MT-Opt policy. Considering the significantly lower success rates of other methods, it is likely that if the data was collected using these approaches, it would yield much lower success rates, and the gap between MT-Opt and the baselines would further increase.",

In addition, we note that semantic picking and placing performance differs substantially between the different tasks.

To examine this, we refer to Fig. 5 lift-bottle, which have more data, especially on-policy data, have higher success rates than underrepresented tasks, such as lift-box.

Table I shows results of the comparison between 12-task and 2-task policies. The 12-task policy outperforms the 2task policy even on the two tasks that the 2-task policy is trained on, suggesting that training multiple tasks not only enables the 12-task policy to perform more tasks, but also improves its performance on the tasks through sharing of representations. In particular, the 12-task MT-Opt policy outperforms the 2-task policy by 7% and 22% for the tasks lift-any and place-any, respectively.

In addition, there are 11200 episodes of successful sausage lifting and as many as 740K failures that were collected during the lift-any task. Combining the liftsausage data and the extra successes from lift-any yields 16600 episodes (12000 successes and 4600 failures). To investigate the influence of MT-Opt and task impersonation on the taskbootstrap problem, we compare our 12-task MT-Opt policy to a single-task policy trained on these 16600 episodes. These include the exact same set of successful lift-sausage episodes as MT-Opt, but does not include the failures from other tasks.",

Second, the less obvious conclusion can be drawn based on the additional failures impersonated from all other tasks. This large set of failures, which often include successful grasps of non-target objects, when further re-balanced as described in Sec.

VI: we define and train the success detector for the new tasks, collect initial data using our lift-any and a place-any policies, and fine-tune a 14-task MT-Opt model that includes all prior as well as the newly defined tasks. While the new tasks are visually and semantically different, in practice the above mentioned policies give reasonable success rate necessary to start the fine-tuning. We switch to running the new policies on the robots once they are at parity with the liftany and place-any policies. After 11K pick-cloth attempts and 3K cover-object attempts (requiring < 1 day of data collection on 7 robots), we obtain an extended 14-task MT policy that performs cloth picking at 70% success and object covering at 44% success. The policy trained only for these two tasks, without support of our offline dataset, yields performance of 33% and 5% respectively, confirming the hypothesis that MT-Opt method is beneficial even if the target tasks are sufficiently different, and the target data is scarce. By collecting additional 10K pick-cloth episodes and 6K cover-object episodes, we further increase the performance of 14-task MT-Opt to 92% and 79%, for cloth picking and object covering respectively. We perform this fine-tuning procedure with other novel tasks such as previously unseen transparent bottle grasping, which reaches a performance of 60% after less than 4 days of data collection. Note that in this experiment, we additionally take advantage of the pre-trained MT-Opt policy for collecting the data for the new task.

Scripted Placing Policy: The scripted policy programmed to perform placing would move the arm to a random location above the left bin that contains a fixture.

In this manner, the original set of labelled data shown in Fig. 14 could act effectively as a much larger dataset for all tasks, where successes of one task often worked an interesting negatives for other tasks. Additionally we balanced the proportion of success and failure examples per task seen by the model during training.",

IV: Quantitative evaluation of MT-Opt with different data impersonation and re-balancing strategies. This table reports performance of 7 different models on the 12 ablation tasks, trained on identical offline dataset, with identical computation budget, and evaluated executing 100 attempts for each task for each strategy on the real robots (totaling to 12*100*7=8400 evaluations). In all cases a shared policy for all 12 tasks is learned. The difference across the strategies is in the way the data is impersonated (expanded), and in the way the impersonated data is further re-balanced. The last column is our best strategy featuring skill-level data impersonation and further data re-balancing. This strategy outperforms other strategies on many different percentiles across all 12 tasks; however the effect of that strategy is even more pronounced for the tasks having scarce data, e.g. lift-can, lift-box, place-top-right, see Mean (low data) statistic. The column #2 indicates the number of episodes which were collected for each task.",

Our data collection started in an original physical lab location, was paused due to COVID-19, and the robots were later setup at a different physical lab location affecting lighting and backgrounds. Initially scripted policies were run collecting data for the lift-anything and place-anywhere tasks. Once performance of our learned policy for these tasks out-performed the scripted policy we shifted to a mix of epsilon greedy and pure on-policy data collection. The majority of our episodes were collected for the lift-anything and place-anywhere tasks with learned policies. It is worth mentioning that over the course of data collection many good and bad ideas where tried and evaluated via on-policy collection. All of these episodes are included in our dataset.

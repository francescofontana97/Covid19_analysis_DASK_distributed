The first emergence of SARS-CoV-2 was in Wuhan, China in December 2019 which caused pneumonia in patients and then spread rapidly to multiple countries (Zhou et al., 2020) . Recently, SARS-CoV-2 infection has continued to increase the mortality rate around the world. Epidemiological studies revealed that the virus is easily spread by droplets in human-to-human transmission (Shereen et al., 2020) . Consequently, rapid detection is crucial to monitor and limit the spread of infections.",

            "text": "The WHO recommends a viral detection protocol based on quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal (NP) or throat swab that is collected in a viral transport medium (VTM). Extracted viral RNA from specimens are reverse transcribed and amplified within specific genes for detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on qRT-PCR (Corman et al., 2020; Radbel et al., 2020) . However, only 4 commercial reagents have been approved for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Esbin et al., 2020) . Meanwhile, the limitations of qRT-PCR include the need for expensive instruments, a specialized molecular laboratory, appropriately trained staff, and approximately 4 h turnaround time for detection. Therefore, several studies have attempted to develop rapid nucleic acid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 such as Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and CRISPR-based diagnostic test (Kilic et al., 2020) . Interestingly, the CRISPR-based diagnostic method was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Joung et al., 2020) The CRISPR-based diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-2 detection consists of DNA Endonuclease Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter (DETECTR) (Broughton et al., 2020) , SHERLOCK Testing in One Pot for COVID-19 (STOPCovid) (Joung et al., 2020) , specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK) (Patchsung et al., 2020) based on CRISPR-Cas12a, CRISPR-Cas12b and CRISPR-Cas13, respectively. However, only Cas12a is commercially available to allow researchers to perform the CRISPR-based diagnosis. The Cas12a recognizes and cleaves double stranded DNA target that complement with the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) called \"cis-cleavage activity\". After that, Cas12a randomly cleaves single stranded DNA probes conjugated with fluorescence-quencher called \"trans-cleavage activity\" (Broughton et al., 2020) (Fig. 1) . Several studies were developed on the CRISPR-Cas12a platform for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, the validations of the CRISPR-Cas12a assay with RNA extracted from clinical specimens were limited. Therefore, this study aims to perform clinical sample evaluation of CRISPR-Cas12a based COVID-19 diagnostic assays.",

Clinical performance of the assay in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy was calculated by a diagnostic test evaluation calculator (https://www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_test.php) based on the formula and calculations as shown in Supplementary Table 1. RPA primers and crRNAs specific to target genes including E (envelope), S (spike) and N (nucleoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2 were validated with clinical specimens obtained from the same cohort. Interpretations of the CRISPR-Cas12a assays were performed based on fluorescent intensities as negative (0) and positive (+1, +2 and +3) (Fig. 2) . The qRT-PCR results showed that 44 and 63 samples were detected as positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The correlations between fluorescence score based on different CRISPR-Cas12a assays and the mean Ct obtained from qRT-PCR are shown in Fig. 3 . In general, the samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 yielded Ct higher than 40 from qRT-PCR and no fluorescent signal from CRISPR-Cas12a assays. On the other hand, the samples positive with higher titers of SARS-CoV-2 yielded lower Ct values from qRT-PCR and higher fluorescent signals based on N1 and S genes of CRISPR-Cas12a assays ( Fig. 3A and D) . There were 6 false-positive samples (scored as +1) obtained from the N2 gene of CRISPR-Cas12a assay, but these samples were negative (Ct > 38) based on qRT-PCR (Fig. 3B ). In addition, 17 false-positive samples (scored as +1 (N = 8), +2 (N = 2) and +3 (N = 7)) obtained from E gene of CRISPR-Cas12a assay yielded a negative result (Ct > 38) based on qRT-PCR (Fig. 3C) . A few false-negative results (scored as 0) were also obtained from all the CRISPR-Cas12a assays, while these samples yielded Ct values lower than 38 based on qRT-PCR (Fig. 3) .",

            "text": "In the current pandemic, there is no vaccine available to prevent against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, rapid and accurate viral detections could decrease the spread of infections. Several studies have attempted to develop CRISPR-Cas12a based detection methods suitable for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2. Broughton et al. developed the CRISPR-Cas12a assay to detect E and N genes of SARS-CoV-2 by using a pair of primers and a crRNA for each gene (Broughton et al., 2020) . Meanwhile, Ding et al. established the method based on a pair of primers and 2 regions of crRNAs within the N gene (Mayuramart et al., 2020) . The current study evaluated the performance of these primers and crRNAs for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on CRISPR-Cas12a assays with RNA extracted from the same clinical specimens. Although the conditions of RPA, Cas12a reaction, fluorescent detection and signal scoring system used in our study were slightly different from the optimal conditions described in previous reports (Broughton et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Mayuramart et al., 2020) , all the assays were performed under the same conditions and tested against samples from the same cohort to ensure appropriate evaluation of the assays. According to our study (Table 2 & Supplementary Table 1) , the CRISPR-Cas12a assays based on N1 (Ding et al., 2020) and S (Mayuramart et al., 2020) genes yielded diagnostic accuracy (\u2265 95 %) comparable to the qRT-PCR results). The CRISPR-Cas12a assays within E, N2 (Broughton et al., 2020) and S (Mayuramart et al., 2020) genes provided suitable sensitivity of detection (\u2265 95 %) while N1 (Ding et al., 2020) and S (Mayuramart et al., 2020) genes provided excellent specificity of detection (100 %). Ideally, multiple target genes should be detected by using CRISPR-Cas12a to ensure the most effective SARS-CoV-2 detection. Therefore, the N1 and S genes might be attractive target genes for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on CRISPR-Cas12a.",

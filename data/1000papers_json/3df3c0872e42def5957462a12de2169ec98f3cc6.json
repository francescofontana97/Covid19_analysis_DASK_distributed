For this purpose, we developed a specific methodology that combines an epidemiological model, known in the literature as \"SIR\" (Susceptible -Infected -Recovered), and a probabilistic state model, also known as \"multi-state\". The model thus conceived was then parameterized using the dataset published by the Italian Government through the Civil Protection and the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0. We therefore estimated the duration of the disease and the related costs, with reference to the strategy currently under discussion between government institutions and social organizations involved. Given the flexibility of the adopted approach, the tool will also be able to provide useful indications in relation to any alternative strategies that the Government could adopt in the near future, as well as being the starting point of an analysis of the epidemic indirect costs such as losses of GDP fractions.",

Defined \u03021 ( ) the time series of the cases observed by the Civil Protection, the fitting procedure seeks the minimum value of the norm \u2211 | 1 ( ) \u2212 1 ( )|. A commonly used approach is the maximization of the log-likelihood of the increases: it is assumed that the quantities \u0394 1 ( ) = 1 ( +1 ) \u2212 1 ( ) represent the expected values of a random Poisson variable whose corresponding observation is \u0394\u03021( ) =\u03021( +1 ) \u2212\u03021( ) = and then the fitting procedure look for the minimum of the norm \u2211 [ \u2212 log(\u03bb i ) + log ( !)]. In principle, different combinations of the two approaches are possible by performing steps I and II for one norm or the other:",

[1] Since then, the World Health Organization has declared a global pandemic, with 1,051,635 global cases of COVID-19, resulting in 56,985 deaths as of April 4, 2020. [2] The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are varied, ranging from mild symptoms such as fever, dyspnea and cough to more severe complications in the case of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and death. Pathogenesis of the disease likely involves initiation of an immune response, resulting in the production of cytokines in a \"cytokine storm\" that damages healthy lung tissue of the host. [3] Future clinical trials are being arranged to determine if bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), an attenuated version of Mycobacterium bovis and vaccine against tuberculosis, has the ability to upregulate the immune system against the novel coronavirus. [4] Furthermore, BCG immunotherapy is often utilized in the field of urology for the treatment of bladder cancer. It is not yet determined if intravesical therapy will have a positive or negative effect on the immune system in bladder cancer patients with COVID-19.",

[3, 10] Stages I and II require a specific adaptive immune response in healthy hosts to eliminate the virus and prevent progression to stage III; thus, strategies to boost immune responses may play a role in the early stages of COVID-19. [10] When this immune response is impaired, the virus will propagate and result in massive destruction of hostaffected tissues. [10] If the disease progresses to stage III, the severe respiratory phase, lymphocytopenia and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been observed, suggesting a \"cytokine storm\" plays a major role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. [3, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Interestingly, a review by D'Antiga [16] of the current and past coronavirus outbreaks found that immunosuppressed patients are not at increased risk for more severe pulmonary disease compared with the general population and concluded there is no reason to postpone life-saving treatments such as transplantation or chemotherapy for cancer. This may be related to the implications of the host immune system response leading to tissue damage in healthy patients that advance to the severe stage of COVID-19, whereas those who are immunocompromised may have a weakened response that could be protective.",

It is thought that the instillation of intravesical BCG results in a large local immune response by induced expression of cytokines in the urine and bladder tissue. [9] BCG first attaches to the urothelium via fibronectin and integrins and is then internalized by urothelial cells and captured by the initial innate immune response. [17] It is then that antigen presentation and cytokine release results in the upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, IL-6, Il-8 and granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). [17] This stimulates local recruitment of immune cells such as granulocytes, CD4 and CD8 T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages that produce TH-1 cytokines. [17] According to Prescott et al., [18] the antitumor activity of BCG in bladder cancer appears to be a local phenomenon confined to the site of administration. In another study, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), urine and serum were obtained from patients with superficial carcinoma at various times during the course of BCG instillation, and found an increase in systemic immune activity. [19] Further research is required to determine the precise mechanisms of action of BCG and advance our current knowledge of the immunological processes involved.",

One major drawback of intravesical BCG is that it is associated with more side effects when compared with intravesical chemotherapy, though more serious adverse outcomes are encountered in less than 5% of patients. [6] Though still debated, pulmonary complications appear to be of two categories: hypersensitivity reactions and mycobacterial pneumonia. An interstitial pattern on chest radiography, lymphocytosis on bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) and absence of granulomas on lung biopsy, as well as negative sputum and tissue cultures, are indicative of hypersensitivity response. [20] Mycobacterial pneumonia is characterized by biopsies revealing granulomata and radiographic evidence of consolidation, although testing for acid-fast bacteria (AFB) may be negative. [20] A large analysis of 2602 patients treated with intravesical BCG revealed 0.4% of patients developed life-threatening BCG sepsis, and 0.7% developed granulomatous pneumonitis. [21] With regard to other intravesical therapy, MMC has little systemic absorption due to low molecular weight, and chemical cystitis is common. [22] ",

            "text": "Intravesical BCG is generally considered to be a relative contraindication and used with caution in immunocompromised patients based on current guidelines. However, there have been few studies that have examined the use of intravesical BCG in bladder cancer patients that are concurrently immunosuppressed. In addition to concerns of disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients, BCG is dependent on an effective immune response to exert its mechanism of action in the case of bladder cancer. This has raised concerns that even if instillation is safe in the immunocompromised population, treatment may be ineffective. Herr and Dalbagni [23] discovered that BCG therapy was safe in immunocompromised patients with high-risk bladder tumours and may achieve similar results to non-immunosuppressed patients. However, the sample size was small, and generalization was cautioned. A retrospective chart review of 24 immunosuppressed patients (e.g. concurrent lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or on corticosteroid therapy) receiving intravesical BCG concluded that the side effects profile associated with BCG therapy in these patients was comparable with those in patients with no evidence of immunosuppression. [24] Additionally, a number of studies have demonstrated safe use in transplant patients, [25, 26] and in patients with concurrent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. [27] Therefore, the use of intravesical BCG may be feasible in patients that are concurrently immunocompromised, but larger trials are required for definitive answers. Though immunosuppressed patients with COVID-19 are not at increased risk for more severe pulmonary disease compared with the general population [16] , intravesical BCG should be used on a case by case basis in this population until definitive outcomes are determined with further studies.",

There has been promising research in recent years exploring the use of BCG against viruses and other immunological disorders with which to build from and guide future studies. Additionally, new clinical trials are being planned to explore the efficacy of boosting immune responses with BCG in the fight against COVID-19. [4] Recently, a study published in 2019 by Gofrit et al. [28] followed 1371 patients for 1 year after their diagnosis with bladder cancer. During follow-up, 65 patients developed Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition in which the immune system is a major contributor to pathogenesis. Of the patients who developed AD, 21 (2.4%) were treated with intravesical BCG, while 44 (8.9%) did not receive BCG therapy. It was determined that patients treated with intravesical BCG manifested more than 4-fold less risk for AD than those not treated with intravesical BCG.",

Descriptive statistics are presented for categorical variables as frequencies and for continuous variables as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs). Pearson's Chi-Squared test was used to evaluate for significant differences in hospital admission by DNR status. Kaplan Meier, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to calculate the hazard ratios of all of the factors. To identify whether recovery or death were independent risk factors associated with the DNR status, univariable and multivariate logistical regression models were analyzed for all the variables. Risk factors were defined as statistically significant with hazard ratios (HR) not including 1.00 in their 95% confidence interval (CI), which indicate an alpha of < 0.05. In order to evaluate the relationship between DNR status and the type of comorbidity, we quantified each comorbidity in the cohort relative to the DNR status and we calculated the hazard ratios in univariate and multivariate Cox regression models to assess their influence on mortality for DNR patients.",

Males were significantly more frequent than females overall in this cohort, and males with DNR were significantly more numerous than males with non-DNR status. Older patients (> 60 yr) had significantly higher DNR rates than younger patients (< 60 yr). Recovered patients with positive SARS-CoV2 had significantly higher non-DNR status compared to the DNR counterpart, and vice versa in those who died. There was no statistical significance in terms of presenting with COVID19 symptoms between DNR and non-DNR patients. However, DNR patients were more likely to present with a non-related (to COVID-19) chief complaint. Patients with DNR had significantly higher numbers of comorbidities ( > 3 comorbidities) compared to patients with non-DNR status. However, there was no statistical significance between the two groups when comparing the average number of overall comorbidities. Further analyses revealed that, as expected, comorbidities emerged to be higher in DNR than non-DNR patients with cardiovascular diseases displaying the greater difference between the two groups Figure 2 . All comorbidities increased the hazard of dying with variable significance Table 2 . Lung, CNS, metabolic, cancer and immune deficiency diseases increased the hazard significantly in the univariable model. Lung, CNS, Cancer and immune deficiency diseases remained significant in the multivariable model.

            "text": "The term \"Exosomes\" defines small extracellular vesicles, ranging from 30 to 150 nm in diameter, secreted by most eukaryotic cells into surrounding body fluids including blood, saliva, urine, bile and breast milk. Extracellular vesicles, which used to be considered a garbage disposal pathway, are getting increasing attention from biomedical investigators, and reports demonstrating the role of these factors in multiple physiological and pathological events keep accumulating. Exosomes were first discovered in reticulocytes from sheep in 1983 by two independent groups [1, 2] . Exosomes are produced by virtually all cells and can carry numerous cell-derived proteins, DNA, RNA, miRNA [3]. These biologically active molecules are protected by the exosomal membrane from degradative enzymes in the blood, allowing delivery of these molecules to cells located far away from the exosome-producing cell. The exosomal membrane is a lipid bilayer containing proteins, cholesterol, phosphatidylserine, ceramide, sphingolipids, and lipid rafts. The proteins identified in exosomes are mainly involved in multivesicular body formation, membrane transport and fusion (e.g., TSG-101, ALIX), adhesion, and antigen presentation (i.e., MHC class I and II molecules). Additionally, tetraspanins, including CD9, CD63, and CD81, heat shock proteins, principally HSP70 and HSP90, and lipid metabolism-related proteins are often present in exosomes (Figure 1) . Exosomes also carry a range of host cell-derived metabolites, DNA fragments and non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), Y-RNAs, fragments of tRNAs, small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs, and piwi-interacting RNAs, and can contain viral RNAs. The ability of exosomes to fuse with target cells facilitates delivery of the exosomal cargo to distant recipients.",

Exosomes released from cells infected with such viruses as HIV, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV), and Dengue Virus (DENV) harbor and deliver many regulatory factors, including viral RNA and proteins, viral and cellular miRNAs, and other host functional genetic elements to neighboring cells, helping to establish productive infections and modulating anti-viral cellular responses [10] . Therefore, targeting exosomes carrying pathogenic viral factors is another, yet unexplored, therapeutic strategy.",

However, studies of body fluid-derived exosomes still remain a challenge, since the isolated exosomes are derived from many different cell types and contain components of body fluids (\"contaminants\"), which have to be removed during exosome isolation. The utility of exosomes as disease markers is challenged by multiple factors that can influence exosome production and properties. For example, hypoxia has been reported as an important environmental factor that affects exosome production [11] . The field of exosomal research is rapidly advancing, but recent technological progress in exosome isolation and their analysis has not yet led to a universally accepted recommendation for exosome isolation [12] .

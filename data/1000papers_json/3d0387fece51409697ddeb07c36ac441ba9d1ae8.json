Of the many factors contributing to the level of transmission of the virus, the weather appears to be significant. In this work, we analyze the impact of weather factors such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and ground-level ozone concentration on the number of COVID-19 cases in Warsaw, Poland. The obtained results show an inverse correlation between ground-level ozone concentration and the daily number of COVID-19 cases.",

The World Health Organization announced COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 12, 2020. Until now (September 10, 2020), over 27 million cases and nearly 900,000 deaths caused by this disease were reported worldwide. In Poland, these rates amounted to over 70,000 cases and over 2000 deaths. Each COVID-19 case follows an individual course. Most infected people develop symptoms that can be described as mild to moderate. Such people recover without hospitalization. However, severe symptoms of the disease are shortness of breath, high fever, cough, loss of sense of smell, and muscle pain. The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 6.4 days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (Lauer et al. 2020 ).",

(2020) found that only daily average temperature was significantly correlated with number of COVID-19 cases in Jakarta. Luo et al. (2020) reported a positive correlation between absolute humidity and case increase, and a weak negative correlation between weather temperature and case increase in several regions in Asia. A study on the effects of temperature and humidity on the daily new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 in 166 countries revealed that both factors were negatively related to the daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19 (Wu et al. 2020) . Poirier et al. (2020) indicated that higher temperatures and locations with higher absolute humidity appeared to have lower COVID-19 transmission. The authors have also identified potential confounders, suggesting that changes in weather alone may not lead to changes in case count without the implementation of public health interventions. Jiwei et al. (2020) proposed that a decrease in the transmissibility of COVID-19 is likely with the arrival of spring in the north hemisphere. However, temperature and humidity were found to contribute to a maximum of 18% of the variation, the remaining 82% to social factors. In their study, Bu et al. (2020) found that the suitable temperature range for SARS-CoV-2 survival is 13-24\u00b0C. Unfortunately, the authors have not identified any confounders and potential strategies to deal with them. Shi et al. (2020) in their retrospective observational study concluded that both low and high temperatures might decrease the COVID-19 incidence, but the duration of the outbreak would depend on the safety measures introduced by particular countries. Ran et al. (2020b) found that the ambient temperature has a nonlinear negative association with COVID-19 transmission. It is also remarked that control strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic barely relying on environmental factors are unlikely to succeed. On the other hand, Yao et al. (2020) showed no association of COVID-19 transmission with temperature or UV radiation in China.",

            "text": "Ozone is generally considered an antiviral agent that damages the viral capsid and upsets its reproductive cycle (Elvis and Ekta 2011) . However, a review of the literature shows that ozone doses that have a virucidal effect range from 0.6 to 6.0 ppm for 20-112 min (Tseng and Li 2008; Yano et al. 2020) . Commercial ozone generators guaranteed antiviral efficacy at 10-20 ppm for 10 min (Dennis et al. 2020; Grignani et al. 2021) . It is therefore clear that the ambient ozone levels are several orders of magnitude lower than the doses used to eliminate respiratory viruses. However, we propose a mechanism that may explain the inverse correlation described above based on alterations of immune system functions. There are a number of reports suggesting that both innate and acquired immunity are regulated by ambient ozone. In general, environmental ozone modifies cell types required for priming innate immunity and contributes to innate-adaptive immune system cross-talk (Al-Hegelan et al. 2011) . The alterations are visible both in the number and type of cells of the immune system and in the substances produced by these cells. For example, increased level of ambient ozone was found to activate innate immune signaling in airway epithelia (Gribar et al. 2008) and to suppress T-lymphocyte-dependent immune response (Al-Hegelan et al. 2011). Moreover, changes in production of proteins involved in immune signaling (interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-17, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1) were observed (Al-Hegelan et al. 2011) . We propose that the activity of another cytokine, interleukin-33, could be a potential explanation of the observed inverse correlation. According to the literature, interleukin-33 is induced by ozone and further activates Th2 phenotype cytokines in the respiratory tract (Ali et al. 2018 ). On the other hand, there is an emerging evidence that Th2-skewed immunity might be protective in COVID-19 patients. This phenotype is able to downregulate the late phase of disease which is typically associated with uncontrolled inflammation (Carli et al. 2020) . The protective role of Th2 phenotype is probably mainly due to the eosinophils. Increase in the number and activation of these cells have traditionally been linked to allergies and asthma, but it turns out that eosinophils, besides their proinflammatory effects, play a crucial role in antiviral responses (Franceschini et al. 2020) . Our candidate, interleukin-33, regulates eosinophils at three stages: development within the bone narrow, activation of matured cells, and activation of mature eosinophils within the tissue (Johnston and Bryce 2017) . Therefore, we suggest that the increased activity of interleukin-33 under the influence of ambient ozone may be responsible for the creation of an immune microenvironment that protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In the described period, the Polish government did not provide the daily number of tests performed, but only informed about the number of positive cases. Moreover, we suspect that asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic cases may have missed the tests for fear of worsening the quality of life (due to quarantine or domestic isolation). Secondly, confounding variables must be taken into consideration. General health policies for a given period, containment measures, public health interventions, population density, and cultural aspects-all of these can contribute to the spread of the virus. Warsaw, as the largest city in the country, is the main communication hub, and the mobility of its inhabitants is at a high level-many of them are commuters from surrounding regions. The inhabitants are characterized by different hygienic habits, lifestyle, profession, etc. Thus, we believe that weather factors cannot be considered separately from social factors.",

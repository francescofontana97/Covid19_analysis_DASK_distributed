Although age, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, and diabetes mellitus seem to represent the main risk factors for worse outcomes in COVID-19 (1), a possible role has also been ascribed to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) (2) (3) (4) . A recent preliminary study collecting questionnaire data in a case series of COVID-19 pneumonia showed that 25% of patients presented a history of SDB (5) . It has been hypothesized that SDB might predispose patients to COVID-19 severe pneumonia and that the coexistence of these two respiratory conditions might worsen patients' prognosis (2, 4) .",

            "text": "Consecutive patients who were hospitalized at our institution in Milan because of COVID-19 over a 1-month period, from April 8 to May 8, 2020, underwent an SAT. The test was performed either at entry or at any time during the course of hospitalization, provided that the patients were breathing spontaneously. Those who had previously required ventilatory support because of COVID-19 respiratory failure underwent an SAT only after weaning from either noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation after improvement of their clinical conditions within the recruitment period. Outcomes were evaluated at the time of patients' discharge and defined according to the two types of treatments needed during hospitalization: 1) none or oxygen support or 2) NIV, including continuous or bilevel positive airways pressure, or mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Owing to the severity of COVID-19, many patients who were hospitalized required NIV or mechanical support at the time of admission and for a long time, or they eventually died, so they could not be included in our study. The SATs were scored after the recruitment period by a sleep clinician who was blinded to hospitalization outcomes. The patients were treated according to their clinical conditions and following the local guidelines for COVID-19. Based on the international criteria and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) calculation, we defined the disease as 1) \"none\" if AHI , 5/h, 2) \"mild\" if 5/h < AHI , 15/h, 3) \"moderate-to-severe\" if 15/h < AHI , 30/h, and 4) \"severe\" if AHI > 30/h. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the SDB presence was calculated through the exact Clopper-Pearson method. A Poisson regression model with robust error variance was implemented to estimate the prevalence ratio and its 95% CI to receive mechanical or nonmechanical ventilation. The model included as covariates sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) as continuous variables and those variables that presented P < 0.15 in the univariate analysis.",

Moreover, the design of our study does not allow us to conclude a causal link between OSA and COVID-19 severity nor to define the direction of such a link. This is because of the different time points at which SAT was performed in different subjects, because of the observational nature of our study, and because of the lack of comparison with a control group. Despite these limitations, however, our study offers, for the first time, information on the prevalence of OSA in patients with COVID-19 by means of a proper objective testing. This high rate of underdiagnosed SDB, particularly OSA, might act as cofactor in the elevated susceptibility for worse COVID-19 sequelae, independently of BMI. An appropriate assessment of SDB presence, type, and severity in patients with COVID-19, also in the hospital setting, might thus favor a more accurate risk stratification and also help decision-making in therapeutic interventions (9, 10) . The possible role of SDB treatment in prognosis improvement of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 needs to be further investigated through properly sized intervention studies. n Author disclosures are available with the text of this letter at www.atsjournals.org.",

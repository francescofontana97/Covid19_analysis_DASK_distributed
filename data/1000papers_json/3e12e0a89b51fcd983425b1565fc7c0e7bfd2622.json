            "text": "T he American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend exercise training (typically in a cardiac rehabilitation [CR] setting) to improve functional status in patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) able to participate (Class I recommendation, level of evidence A). To date, few studies have determined CR referral and enrollment rates in heart failure (HF) patients. [1] [2] [3] [4] These studies have found that CR referral and participation rates for HF patients are low (10.4% and 2.6-41%, respectively). [1] [2] [3] [4] A major barrier to CR referral was the lack of insurance coverage. 5, 6 In 2014, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated coverage of CR for selected patients with HFrEF (ie, those who meet CMS referral criteria). It would be expected that the introduction of this CMS coverage would result in greater CR referral and participation rates. To this point, a previous study reported that CR participation rates were 41% in patients with HFrEF following CMS coverage 3 ; however, referral rates were not reported. Other studies reporting CR referral and participation rates following CMS coverage approval have found low CR participation rates 1, 4 ; however, it is unclear whether these patients met CMS entry criteria for CR. Thus, we sought to assess CR referral, enrollment, and graduation rates in patients with HFrEF following introduction of CMS coverage for CR.",

The 2009-2012 cohort was included to establish a baseline estimate of CR referral, enrollment, and graduation prior to CMS approval of CR. Patients were initially identified using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9/10) code 428/I.50 (HF) and were excluded if they had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >35%, history of stroke with persistent and debilitating symptoms (eg, paralysis), or lacked valid research authorization as required by the Minnesota statute. An LVEF >35% was used as exclusion criteria, as the CMS has approved coverage for CR for HFrEF patients with an LVEF \u226435%.

This finding suggests that referral is a major barrier limiting HFrEF patients from enrolling (and graduating from) CR. An additional important finding of the present study was that the CR graduation rate was 41% in the 2014-2019 cohort. In contrast to coronary artery disease, 7 older age (ie, \u226575 yr) was the only significant predictor of completing \u226525 CR sessions in the 2014-2019 cohort. In conclusion, we found that CR was underutilized and that participation rates did not significantly improve following the introduction of CMS coverage, suggesting the presence of T he global crisis of COVID-19 has highlighted how the health care system needs to adapt. Telemedicine services have proven to be essential during this time. 1 Previous studies have shown that telemedicine reduces hospitalizations, enhances care, and increases treatment compliance. 2 During the pandemic, Israel had a partial lockdown (January 15, 2020, to May 10, 2020). Extreme restrictions were implemented, which are shown to have an adverse effect on physical and mental health in patients with chronic diseases. 3, 4 Remote cardiac rehabilitation programs (RCRP), however, continued. Previous studies have shown that RCRP are effective, safe, and equivalent to institutional rehabilitation. 5 So far, few have analyzed the susceptibility of patients to telemedicine programs during COVID-19.",

In the last decades, CPX has received increasing attention as a tool to determine readiness for major cancer surgery, becoming a fundamental test to risk stratify patients undergoing evaluation for major thoracic resections. The examination is conventionally performed stressing the patient on a bicycle or a treadmill, using a tight-fitting face mask for the analysis of ventilation and gas exchange. Certain groups of patients present a challenge for conducting CPX, for example those with permanent tracheostomy postlaryngectomy. [1] [2] [3] [4] The lack of an upper airway represents the main problem, especially considering that the CPX system is specifically designed for use with a unique face mask.

The CT-driven fine-needle biopsy of the lesion revealed a primitive adenocarcinoma of the lung. Once the clinical staging, according to positron emission tomography (PET), confirmed the single pulmonary location without obvious nodal involvement or disease outside the chest, the patient was referred to our division for thoracic surgery evaluation. According to tumor location and current clinical practice guidelines (IA), a right lower lobectomy and mediastinal nodal dissection was suggested. 5 Pulmonary function test (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec [FEV 1 ]/forced vital capacity = 65% and diffusion lung carbon monoxide [DLCO] = 51%) and the cardiology assessment suggested the completion of pre-operative work-up with a CPX. 3 Based on experience, we found that the standard cycle-based CPX set-up in the cardiac rehabilitation unit Gerathem Respiratory (Ergostik) was not compatible with the tracheal cannula, neither with a tracheostomy tube nor a silicon laryngeal ring on stoma adhesive support.

While there are currently no effective treatments for AD, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids have the potential to provide a better understanding of Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Nevertheless, developing brain organoid models is expensive, time consuming and often does not reflect disease progression. Using accurate and inexpensive computer simulations of human brain organoids can overcome the current limitations. Induced whole brain organoids (aiWBO) will greatly expand our ability to model AD and can guide wet lab research. In this study, we have successfully developed and validated artificially induced a whole brain organoid platform (NEUBOrg) using our previously validated machine learning platform, DeepNEU (v6.1). Using NEUBorg platform, we have generated aiWBO simulations of AD and provided a novel approach to test genetic risk factors associated with AD progression and pathogenesis.",

This landmark paper demonstrated conclusively that human fibroblasts could be transformed, with four transcription factors and optimal conditions, into cells closely resembling human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). These transformed cells have become widely referred to as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Since 2007 iPSCs have become a mainstay technology for disease modeling, stem cell therapies, drug discovery and specific cell line differentiation. More recently iPSCs have been used to develop tissue specific spheroids and more complex organoids show some early promise both as research tools and disease specific transplant options (Hattori, 2014; Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014; Lancaster and Huch, 2019 ). An organoid has been defined as an artificially grown mass of cells or tissue that resembles an organ. While still in its infancy, the science of human organoids has been used successfully to develop multiple organoid types including intestine, heart, pancreas, liver, lung, and brain to name a few (Kim et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Cerebral organoids have been produced with some early successes (Hattori, 2014; Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014) . Cerebral organoids continue to evolve as useful tools for modeling more common chronic and degenerative neurologic diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and rarer neurological disorders like RETT syndrome, Huntington's disease and Zika microcephaly are also amenable to cerebral organoid modeling (Logan et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2019) . In general, any neurologic disease that can be represented in an induced stem cell model can theoretically also be represented in a cerebral organoid. To date, two main approaches have been employed to produce cerebral organoids from human stem cells (Qian et al., 2019) . These two methods have been labeled as unguided and guided. The unguided approach relies on the tendency of iPSC to develop toward neural precursors if given enough time and an optimal cellular environment. The guided method uses sequential combinations of small molecules and modified media to generate cerebral organoids. Both methods produce organoids that take many months to mature, result in recognizable and semi-organized cerebral tissue with similar limitations. Growing cerebral organoids in vitro has been challenging in several important ways. For example, modeling cerebral vasculature and a functional blood brain barrier remain problematic (Zhao et al., 2015; Lancaster and Huch, 2019; Qian et al., 2019; Marx, 2020; Workman and Svendsen, 2020) . In addition, the in vitro organoids lack a blood supply and this important deficit results in a variable amount of central necrosis as the organoids outgrow the ability of diffusion to deliver oxygen, nutrients, and remove toxic waste by products (Wang, 2018) .",

This technology attempts to reproduce forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain structures with rostral-caudal as well as ventral-dorsal organization. The development of whole brain organoids has been advanced by combining regionally specific organoids in vitro like cerebral, cerebellar, retinal organoids, and directing the development of functional vascular elements (Chen et al., 2020) . Rotating bioreactors with complex media have provided additional improvement in evolving whole brain organoids (Qian et al., 2018) . Overall, this process is technologically demanding and requires considerable time and expense to achieve modest results. A recent study has concluded that at present, whole brain organoids do not faithfully reproduce all elements of the human brain (Bhaduri et al., 2020) . This is particularly true regarding the internal architecture and neural connections. One suggested explanation for the observed differences could be the significant and multiple stresses that occur during the growth and development of iPSC and avascular organoids over protracted periods of time. This suggestion is supported by the observation that transplanted brain organoids tend to become more organized and representative of the native neural tissue (Bhaduri et al., 2020) .",

AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death among seniors (Alzheimer's Association, 2020). Increasing evidence has suggested that loss or dysfunction of different brain cell types likely contribute to AD progression (De Strooper and Karran, 2016) . Thus, modeling these cells and examining their interactions will shed mechanistic insights into AD pathogenesis.

Several important modifications to the original 2007 protocol were required to promote differentiation from aiPSC to aiWBO. The modified protocol began with the activation of four transcription factors OCT4, cMYC, KLF4, and SOX2. In addition, we used a simulated B27 neural media with supplementary zinc and ascorbic acid in the presence of doxycycline and normal levels of ambient oxygen (21%) and increased carbon dioxide (5%). The aiPSC to aiWBO transformation using the above cocktail was carried out in a simulated slow rotating low shear bioreactor, which has been shown to improve the production of WBO from iPSCs. A bioreactor is a vessel that creates an optimal environment that facilitates biological reactions and is used to culture aerobic cells and organoids. The simulated bioreactor environment used in this project was based on protocols for organoid development described in detail elsewhere (Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014; Qian et al., 2018) . For all simulations age was fixed at 65 years. AGE is an input value that varies between \u22121 and +1 and can be set by the experimenter or evolved by the simulation. A value of \u22121 represents time of birth, 0 represents 50 years and +1 represents an age \u2265 100 years of age. All aiWBO simulation experiments were carried out in triplicate. The complete cocktail is summarized below in Table 1 .",

The spinal cord was not simulated in the current project. The main cell types included are neural precursor cells (NPC/NSC) found primarily in the radial glial (RG) layer, neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursors (OPC), oligodendrocytes, interneurons, and microglial cells. Additional cell types include endothelial cells and pericytes which are important components of the blood brain barrier (BBB). The rostral caudal regions simulated include forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. The ventral dorsal regions include ventral forebrain, etc. The horizontal layers of the cerebral cortex arranged from outer to inner include Layers 1-6 and the 4 main layers of the cerebellar cortex from outer to inner are also simulated. NEUBOrg platform, aiWBO simulations, was built based on the following comprehensive literature to provide genotypic and phenotypic markers for identifying cell types, brain regions and cortical layers (Ahn et al., 2004; Logan et al., 2011 Logan et al., , 2020 Santos et al., 2011; Kirsch et al., 2012; Hattori, 2014; Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014; Lippmann et al., 2015; Zemke et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2015; Tkachenko et al., 2016; Espuny-Camacho et al., 2018; Krefft et al., 2018; McKenzie et al., 2018; Qian et al., 2018 Qian et al., , 2019 Wang, 2018; Chen et al., 2019 Chen et al., , 2020 Do and Hong, 2019; Gerakis and Hetz, 2019; Kim et al., 2019 Kim et al., , 2020 Lancaster and Huch, 2019; Velasco et al., 2019; Bhaduri et al., 2020; Papaspyropoulos et al., 2020) .

This test provides an exact probability, can compensate for prediction bias, and is ideal for determining the statistical significance of experimental deviations from an actual distribution of observations that fall into two outcome categories (e.g., success or fail or agree or disagree). For all aiWBO simulations, the null hypothesis (H 0 ) states that there is no significant relationship between simulation predictions and published wet lab data. The H 0 is rejected if the p-value is <0.05 and is interpreted to indicate that the observed relationship between aiWBO predictions and actual outcomes is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. For other between group (e.g., aiWBO vs. aiWBO-APOE4) comparisons, the Mann-Whitney U test of significance was used (Addinsoft, 2019) .

Our unguided approach toward brain organoid development relied on the natural tendency of iPSC to differentiate toward complex neural outcomes given enough time and optimal physical and environmental conditions. When we evaluated the aiWBO simulations by applying the wet lab, published genotypic and phenotypic features of a whole brain organoid, the results confirm that the simulations performed well in that they reliably reproduced the wet lab profile. The probability that the expression of all (N = 46) features were predicted by chance alone using the binomial test is <0.00000001. The important anatomical and regional aspects of the neonatal brain were all predicted accurately. In addition, the simulations appear to have evolved rudimentary elements of a functioning microcirculation and blood brain barrier. Both elements are limited by the absence of a functioning systemic and cerebral circulation. Importantly, the current level of sophistication of these aiWBO simulations has been achieved without expensive or demanding and timeconsuming protocols or the need to grow and then combine individual organoids like cerebral, cerebellar and blood brain barrier into more complex whole brain like structures.",

While more advanced disease largely results in neuronal loss, the current results would suggest that the AD simulations represent an early/milder form of the disease. This conclusion is supported by several other factors. Firstly, Age was arbitrarily set at 65 years for the simulations. Based on the available data this age is widely suggested as a reasonable lower limit for late onset AD (LOAD) and above the upper limit for early onset AD (EOAD). In addition, we wanted to explore the impact of an isolated increase in APOE4, so other factors which are known to exacerbate the disease including diabetes, tobacco abuse, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and advanced age were all turned off during simulation generation. Finally, this conclusion is supported by the prediction of a significant decline in new synapses formation and loss of synaptic function in AD simulations.

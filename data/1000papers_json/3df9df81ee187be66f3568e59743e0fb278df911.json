RT-PCR depends on the exponential amplification of template to form product, which is measured using a fluorescence signal that is directly proportional to the concentration of product (e.g. an intercalating fluorophore). Fluorescence signal is monitored over time as repeat cycles of PCR are performed. In the early cycles, the signal is typically below the detection threshold and so appears as a flat baseline; this is the lag phase. As exponential amplification continues, the signal crosses the detection threshold and exponential growth becomes apparent; this is the log phase. As amplification continues further, formation of double-stranded product and primer consumption inhibit the amplification reaction [1, 2] , causing the growth of the signal to stall; this is the plateau phase. Typically a signal threshold ( ) is chosen within the region where the log phase is apparent; the cycle at which the signal crosses is called the Ct value. Note that because monitoring is continuous, the Ct value can be fractional (e.g. 6.54 cycles, as opposed to cycle 6 or cycle 7).",

Because PCR results in a doubling of product in each cycle (at maximum efficiency and ignoring measurement error, inhibitors, and other extenuating factors), we know that e k will have a value in the vicinity of 2. However we also know that inhibition of the polymerase by PCR product will make this ratio fall with each cycle, and we will need to measure this fall or else risk underestimating the amount of starting material.

However, within this range, the model and calibrator show almost an identical slope and nearly complete overlap. Therefore, we conclude that Eq. 6 is highly predictive of the relationship between Ct and viral load. We expect that significant deviations from model predictions are less likely to occur at very early cycle thresholds, i.e., greater than 10 6 genome copies/mL, as PCR reaction inhibition observed at high cycles numbers is limited and therefore amplification parameters are more predictable. Therefore, we predict that the extension of model predictions to 10 9 genome copies/mL is likely to be reasonably accurate.",

Validation. The model was validated using calibration control material obtained from the United States Food and Drug Administration. The inactivated, tissue culture cell-grown SARS-CoV-2 reference material was provided with virus quantified in arbitrary units/mL rather than in viral genome copies/mL. Therefore, to aid in comparison of model predictions and the calibration standard, serial 10-fold dilutions of the standard were prepared in quadruplicate and finer dilutions prepared surrounding the assay limit of detection (LoD) in replicates of ten. The dilutions were then tested using the Abbott M2000 RealTime PCR assay to correlate LoD with Ct. The LoD was determined using simple logistic regression (Prism 8.0 for MacOS, Graphpad Software, LLC, San Diego, CA) based on the detection percentage at each dilution. The LoD of the Abbott assay was also determined by testing serial dilutions of the SeraCare standard (see Materials and Methods,",

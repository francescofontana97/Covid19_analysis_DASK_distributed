In French and Spanish, the name of the disease resulting from the virus (COVID-19) is grammatically feminine, whereas the virus that causes the disease (coronavirus) is masculine. In this research, we test whether the grammatical gender mark affects judgments. In a series of experiments with French and Spanish speakers, we show that grammatical gender affects virus-related judgments consistent with gender stereotypes: feminine-(vs. masculine-) marked terms for the virus lead individuals to assign lower stereotypical masculine characteristics to the virus, which in turn reduces their danger perceptions. The effect generalizes to precautionary consumer behavior intentions (e.g., avoiding restaurants, movies, public transportation, etc.) as well as to other diseases, and is moderated by individual differences in chronic gender stereotyping. These effects occur even though the grammatical gender assignment is semantically arbitrary.",

There is some indirect evidence consistent with this reasoning. Using archival data, Jung et al. (2014) showed that hurricanes with feminine names caused more deaths than hurricanes with masculine names. Although the underlying process was not tested, the authors proposed that the effects occurred because the femininenamed hurricanes were considered less risky because of gender-stereotypical associations, resulting in less preparedness for potential negative consequences. However, it is also important to note that the archival results have been strongly contested (Christensen & Christensen, 2014; Malter, 2014; Smith, 2016 ).",

First, we extend previous linguistic research (Konishi, 1993) showing that grammatical gender influences perceptions of masculinity and femininity in gender-stereotypical ways by showing that these perceptions influence downstream judgments (perceptions, behavioral intentions). To our knowledge, this is the first research to show such downstream consequences, suggesting that the effects of grammatical gender on gender-stereotypical perceptions happen spontaneously, rather than only when the perceptual judgments are explicitly elicited (cf. Konishi, 1993; Sera et al., 1994) . Second, we extend the findings of Jung et al. (2014) , showing the effects of name gender on risk perceptions by explicating the underlying process, demonstrating the generalizability of the effect, and with a more subtle activation of gender stereotyping (grammatical gender). Finally, we contribute to research on the intersection of language and consumer behaviour (Pogacar et al., 2018) by showing that in gendered languages, although Accepted Article grammatical gender of nonhuman nouns is an irrelevant contextual cue, it nevertheless affects consumer judgments by activating gender stereotypes.",

Although the masculine form for is grammatically incorrect, French speakers more often than not mistakenly use it (see MDA, Part 7 for examples). Thus, the manipulation also has ecological validity.

First, the research contributes to the literature documenting the effects of seemingly irrelevant information on important consumer judgments. Assignment of grammatical gender is arbitrary, and thus should not logically influence judgments; speakers of gendered languages are well-aware that grammatical gender has no meaning for nonhuman entities. Second, our findings extend research on grammatical gender effects, and contribute to the larger debate as to whether language influences thought (Lucy, 1997; Whorf, 1952) . Our research further confirms and extends the findings on the implicit nature of grammatical gender effects (Boutonnet et al., 2012; Cubelli et al., 2011) by showing that grammatical gender can influence judgements and decision-making, even if such information is irrelevant and not explicitly elicited.",

For one, although our research focused on specific virus-related judgments, grammatical gender is likely to influence other types of consumer judgments. For example, to the extent that grammatical gender nonconsciously activates gender-related concepts, it may influence judgments of gendermarked brand names and products. Further, to the extent that grammatical gender imparts human-related information (either masculine or feminine), the gender mark of a product (or the absence of gender marks in genderless languages) may influence how consumers interact with products, such as the extent to which they anthropomorphize them.",

Given that grammatical gender effects are more likely to occur in languages with only two grammatical genders (Maciuszek & \u015awi\u0105tkowska, 2019) , one avenue for future research is to test the generalizability of the effect in languages with more than two grammatical genders.",

We tested for mediation with the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrapping samples(Hayes, 2017), with grammatical gender as the independent variable, future behavioral intentions as the dependent variable, and future danger perceptions as the mediator. Grammatical gender condition significantly predicted future danger perceptions, \u03b2 = -0.38, SE = 0.16, t(145) = -2.348, p = .020, 95% CI = [-0.70, -0.06], and future danger perceptions significantly predicted future behavioral intentions, \u03b2 = 0.42, SE = 0.08, t(144) = 5.504, p < .001, 95% CI = [0.27, 0.57]. When we controlled for future danger perceptions, grammatical gender condition no longer predicted precautionary behavioral intentions (p = .124). Moreover, the indirect effect of grammatical gender on future behavioral intentions was significant, \u03b2 = -0.16, SE = 0.08, 95% CI = [-0.34, -0.02], indicated by the 95% CI not including zero, which suggests the effect of grammatical gender on precautionary behavioral intentions was mediated by perceived future danger. 1b. We tested for mediation with the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrapping samples (Hayes, 2017), with grammatical gender as the independent variable, future behavioral intentions as the dependent variable, and future danger perceptions as the mediator. Grammatical gender condition significantly predicted future danger perceptions, \u03b2 = -0.38, SE = 0.16, t(149) = -2.342, p = .021, 95% CI = [-0.69, -0.06], and future danger perceptions significantly predicted future behavioral intentions, \u03b2 = 0.48, SE = 0.07, t(149) = 6.653, p < .001, 95% CI = [0.34, 0.62]. The effect of grammatical gender on precautionary behavioral intentions was again mediated by perceived future danger (\u03b2 = -0.18, SE = 0.08, 95% CI = [-0.36, -0.03]). 1c. We tested for mediation with the PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrapping samples (Hayes, 2017). Grammatical gender condition significantly predicted future danger perceptions, \u03b2 = -0.33, SE = 0.15, t(148) = -2.176, p = .031, 95% CI = [-0.62, -0.03], and future danger perceptions significantly predicted future behavioral intentions, \u03b2 = 0.51, SE = 0.09, t(148) = 5.711, p < .001, 95% CI = [0.33, 0.68]. The indirect effect of grammatical gender on future behavioral intentions was significant, \u03b2 = -0.17, SE = 0.09, 95% CI Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright.

For the diseases that were included in the masculine and the feminine set, fatality risk rates for each are indicated in the table below. The difference between the masculine (M = 26.61, SD = 37.08) and the feminine set (M = 26.72, SD = 40.47) in terms of objective fatality rates was statistically not significant; t(16) = 0.006 , p = .995.

The death rate is not indicated in the Global Burden of Disease Index. However, based on the mortality statistics from the early 20 th century the rate appears to be 0.1. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsushistorical/mortstatbl_1908.pdf (page 102) [open access]. c Global mortality associated with seasonal influenza epidemics: New burden estimates and predictors from the GLaMOR Project (Paget et al., 2019). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6815659/ [open access].",

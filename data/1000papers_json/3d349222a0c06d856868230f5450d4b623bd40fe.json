In the United States, 2% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 were aged <18 years as of April 2, 2020 [3] . From March 1 to December 12, 2020, among the laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in the United States in children, adolescents, and young adults aged 0-24 years, 42.6% were aged 0-17 years and 0.3% had severe obesity defined as body mass index (BMI) of \u226540 kg/m 2 [4] . Illness among pediatric cases appears to be mild. The predominant signs and symptoms are similar to other viral respiratory infections including fever, cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting are less common manifestations [5] . According to data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions such as cancer, chronic kidney disease, immunocompromised state from a solid organ transplant, sickle cell disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, serious heart conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. However, at the onset of the pandemic, obesity was not a commonly recognized risk factor in the pediatric population. While it is now specified as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection in children, the associated severity of disease and clinical course is not yet well established.",

Echocardiogram was normal. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Due to continued hypoxemia, respiratory support was escalated to bi-level positive airway pressure.

It has been postulated that chronic inflammationhypercytokinemia, endothelial dysfunction, cardiac abnormalities, and pro-thrombotic environment are the possible mechanisms through which obesity leads to worse COVID-19 outcomes [10] . The dysfunctional hypertrophic adipocytes in obesity produce an excessive amount of cytokines leading to the increased recruitment of macrophages which, in turn, produce high amounts of pro-inflammatory molecules. A published study looked at the immune responses of 54 COVID-19 patients, 28 of whom had severe respiratory failure (SRF). It was observed that all the patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 who developed SRF displayed hyper-inflammatory responses with features of either immune dysregulation or macrophage activation syndrome, both of which are characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes and dysregulation of lymphocytes, characterized by CD4 lymphopenia and subsequently B cell lymphopenia, are the two key features of this immune dysregulation [11] . A case series of three patients suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes the induction of endotheliitis in several organs as a direct consequence of viral involvement and the host inflammatory response; as shown by the presence of viral elements within endothelial cells and an accumulation of inflammatory cells, with evidence of endothelial and inflammatory cell death [12] .",

However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to reopen the economy. The accuracy of the model is good (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "There is a critical need to understand public sentiment concerning post-COVID-19 economic reopening, and the associated socioeconomic factors. Since being first documented in the mid-1960s, there have been seven identified Coronaviruses in the world that can infect humans. Within the human population, Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) which causes the disease known as COVID-19 is the fifth endemic Coronavirus including 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 [1, 2] . COVID-19 is the highly infectious disease caused by the third identifiable Coronavirus that emerged among humans in the last two decades. Among the three most recent Coronaviruses, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in China between November 2002 and July 2003 spread in 17 countries with a fatality rate of 9.6% [3, 4] . In 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was discovered in the Middle East affected 24 countries with a fatality rate of 34.4% [4, 5] . COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China, by the end of December 2019, already affected over 10 million people in 213 countries of the world with a fatality rate, that had reportedly almost reached 10% among the closed cases [6] . It is a highly infectious and deadly disease, with widespread transmission and significantly negative impacts on physical, emotional and mental health, economy, and peoples way of living [7, 8] . To control the spread of COVID-19, federal government declared statewide emergency and states governments implemented stay-athome-order, imposed restriction on mass gathering and non-essential movements. Consequently, people are confined at home with constant fear and uncertainty. Additionally, the unemployment rate showed an increasing trend. To tackle economic depression, many people are arguing to reopen the economy. This study investigates the sentiment of people towards reopening the US economy and finds the underlying socioeconomic factors that are associated with prominent public sentiment. We combine the US public Twitter sentiment and the US demographic information from the US Census Bureau. The studied US Census regions are shown in Fig. 1 . Continuous lockdown is not a long-term solution for any country. Deliveries of necessary medical supplies including personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and lab equipment are hindered because of the travel restrictions. The supply of necessary foods and household necessities has been halted due to the affected global supply chain system. According to the US Department of Labor, the US economy has lost about 20.5 million jobs with a surge of the unemployment rate to 14.7% in April 2020 which surpassed the post-World War II record of 10.8% in 1982 [9] . Labor Body of the United Nations (UN) reported that the world is expected to witness a 6.7% elimination of working hours, which is equivalent to 195 million jobs, in the second quarter of 2020 due to economic disruption triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic [10] . This economic downfall describes the depth of the economic recession worldwide caused by COVID-19 and related lockdowns and travel restrictions. Moreover, the persistence of the Coronavirus outbreak is posing a threat to the education systems. Schools, colleges, and universities are closed because of the virus which is hampering in-seat education and hands-on laboratory work severely [11] . Many local, as well as international students, are the worst victims because they are considered as the potential risk of COVID-19 importation [12, 13] . However, taking into account the adverse effects of COVID-19, people are craving to go back to normal life and regular activities. The emotionally challenging but true reality is that, amidst the fear of pandemic, people need to go out, do their jobs and run the economy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 477, "end": 480, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 481, "end": 483, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 833, "end": 836, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 837, "end": 839, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 993, "end": 996, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 997, "end": 999, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1235, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1428, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1431, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2747, "end": 2750, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3008, "end": 3012, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3402, "end": 3406, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3552, "end": 3556, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3557, "end": 3560, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2187, "end": 2193, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Past research investigated fear and trust sentiments of the people towards reopening the economy in the US using exploratory textual analytics, textual data visualization, and hypothesis testing techniques [8] .

ACS is conducted by the US Census Bureau each year to collect vital information about the citizens. The data is free, publicly available, and considered as an important source of information for researchers from different disciplines.

The model assessed that imposing lockdown one week earlier in all the three states could have saved hundreds of lives from COVID-19. However, to reopen the economy even with a limited capacity it is required to reduce the population contact down to 20-25% and implement strict social distancing measures along with the use of personal protective equipment [47] . Besides, a robust testing capacity would help the policymakers to estimate more precise reopening dates and it would be beneficial to detect and isolate asymptomatic carriers in a quicker manner after reopening. Various empirical evidence, trials, and observations suggested that the proper use of medical masks, combined with other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as thorough handwashing and strict social distancing, testing, contact tracing, and quarantine, is an effective way to reduce or interrupt the transmission of respiratory infections of COVID-19.

A total of 293,597 tweets with 90 variables were downloaded using the keyword reopen. The detailed methodology of data acquisition, saving, cleaning, and filtering for obtaining a subset of them that were generated from different states of the US has been described in Section 3.2. After systematic cleaning and filtering, a final dataset consisting of 2507 tweets and twenty-nine variables were used for sentiment analysis and exploring the socioeconomic factor associations that influence sentiments of the people towards reopening the economy. Fig. 2a shows total number of tweets collected from each states in the US. The figure demonstrates that a large number of tweets were generated from the Western and Northeastern regions of the US. Most of the tweets were collected from California, Texas, New work, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, Arizona, and Nevada. In contrast, no tweets were collected from North Dakota. Sentiment analysis is a popular topic of research among the researchers after collecting data from Twitter, webpage, product reviews, newspaper etc. [26, [50] [51] [52] . The primary objective of the sentiment analysis is to investigate opinions, attitudes, and emotions of the users (i.e., positive or negative feeling) towards a subject matter of interest (e.g., entity, person, issue, event, and topic). Sentiment analysis is beneficial for both customers and service providers to improve the mutual relationships [26] . In this study, Twitter data was analyzed to understand the sentiments of the Americans towards the new normal reopening amidst COVID-19 outbreak. Using R packages Syuzhet and sentimentr, sentiments were classified and assigned a score based on matching keywords, word sequences, and prewritten lexicons. Sentiment score was assigned within a range of -2 to +2. The maximum negative value indicates negative sentiment, whereas the maximum positive value indicates positive sentiment, with a score 0 indicates neutral sentiment. Results from a preliminary analysis showed that about 48.27% of the users expressed positive sentiment. In contrast, about 36.82% and 14.92% of the users expressed negative and neutral sentiments, respectively.

We collected data from Twitter to understand feelings of the people by using the rTweet package in R and associated Twitter API. However, this method is generally applicable for collecting data from any social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and news agency) regarding any real-world social events (e.g., manmade and natural disasters, political affairs, religious and racial conflicts). After filtering the tweet's information, the data is saved in CSV format for subsequent prepossessing. Data preprocessing (e.g., cleaning, removing noises) is an important step in text analysis and classification. In the data preprocessing steps, unnecessary words, such as stop words (i.e., pronouns, articles, prepositions such as the, a, about, we, our, etc. that do not have any significant contribution to text classification), noises (i.e., punctuation, special characters), and abusive words (i.e., slang words) were removed from the text to improve the efficiency of the system [53] , [54] . Moreover, tokenization and normalization techniques are applied to process the text. Tokenization is the process of dividing texts into words, phrases, and symbols which are known as tokens [55] . The main goal of the tokenization is to find out the words or group of words in a sentence, which is the foundation of text analysis. Tokenization is very important for text analysis because a meaningful computation primarily depends on the components (tokens) of the text, not on the full text. For example, if there is a sentence like we have collected data from twitter. After tokenization, the set of tokens will be: {we, have, collected, data, from, twitter}. Normalization transforms words into a common form that allows the computer to identify the same words with similar meaning and remove one of them [54] , consequently significantly reduces data size and increases computational efficiency. Lowercasing, stemming and lemmatization are three important and useful methods of text normalization. Lowercasing converts every letter to lowercase and make similar words consistent to each other [53] . For example, lowercasing converts each letter of An and an to lowercase and helps the computer to identify the two words are identical. Stemming converts words to their base form (stem) [56] . The same word appears in different forms in the texts that are consolidated into the same features [57] . For example, the semantic meaning of read and reading is the same, thus they are combined as read to avoid any confusion. Lemmatization is the most advanced method of text normalization, which replaces words with their same morphological root using a dictionary [54] . Lemmatization is very similar to stemming. However, the basic difference between them is that lemmatization does not produce a stem but replace the suffix of the word to normalize it with usually a different word suffix [58] . Normalized words with both stemming and lemmatization could be the same. For example, normalized word of reads, reads, and reading is the same in both methods.

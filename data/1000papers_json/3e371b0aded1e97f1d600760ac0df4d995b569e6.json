Decision regret is one of the most prevalent outcomes reported by informal caregivers who have made such decisions. Objective. To examine levels of decision regret and its predictors among informal caregivers who have made health-related decisions for a loved one. Data sources. We performed a systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to November 2018. Participants were informal caregivers, and the outcome was decision regret as measured using the Decision Regret Scale (DRS). Review methods. Two reviewers independently selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We performed a narrative synthesis and presented predictors of decision regret using a conceptual framework, dividing the predictors into decision antecedents, decision-making process, and decision outcomes. Results. We included 16 of 3003 studies identified. Most studies (n = 13) reported a mean DRS score ranging from 7.0 to 32.3 out of 100 (median = 14.3). The methodological quality of studies was acceptable. We organized predictors and their estimated effects (b) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) as follows: decision antecedents (e.g., caregivers' desire to avoid the decision, OR 2.07, 95% CI [1.04-4.12], P = 0.04), decisionmaking process (e.g., caregivers' perception of effective decision making, b = 0.49 [0.05, 0.93], P \\ 0.01), and decision outcomes (e.g., incontinence, OR = 4.4 [1.1, 18.1], P \\ 0.001). Conclusions. This review shows that informal caregivers' level of decision regret is generally low but is high for some decisions. We also identified predictors of regret during different stages of the decision-making process. These findings may guide future research on improving caregivers' experiences.",

Family caregivers (or informal caregivers) include family, close relatives, friends, and/or neighbors who provide unpaid care to someone close to them, in contrast to a formal caregiver, who provides paid care services. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Family caregivers 11 play an invaluable role in the health care system and benefit society and government budgets by providing unpaid care and psychological support to a person in need with whom they maintain a personal relationship. 10 They may also help care recipients make preference-sensitive decisions in a variety of clinical contexts. 10, 16, 17 Research has characterized the experience of informal caregivers as stressful and burdensome, [18] [19] [20] including when serving as health care decision makers for care recipients. 21 In addition, evidence has shown that whenever decision outcomes fail to satisfy patients, those involved in the decision-making process may experience decision regret. 2, 22 Informal caregivers are thus at increased risk of experiencing decision regret. 23, 24 Although there have been studies on decision regret following health-related decisions, few studies have shown how decision regret affects informal caregivers who make health decisions for their loved ones. 4 Evaluating regret among informal caregivers could help determine where additional support is needed. 1, 2, [25] [26] [27] We therefore aimed to review levels of decision regret among informal caregivers making proxy health-related decisions and to identify predictors of this regret.",

Fifth, we compared levels of decisional regret reported (no regret, mild regret, and moderate to strong regret). Lastly, we used a conceptual framework of the decision-making process designed by Sepucha and Mulley to classify the various potential predictors of decisional regret (decision antecedents, decision-making process, and decision outcomes). 35, 36 We also explored individual studies to contextualize results at each step.",

They included from 15 to 444 caregivers (median = 83) of both sexes, except for 1 study conducted exclusively with women. 23 The mean age of the caregivers ranged from 30.9 to 62 y (median age = 54 y). Decisions were made in a variety of contexts: intensive care, 24 49 cardiology, 40 and primary care. 35 The most frequently reported psychometric characteristic of the DRS was the Cronbach's alpha coefficient, which ranged from 0.44 to 0.92 (median = 0.75). Only 3 studies assessed the decisional regret score longitudinally over a 6-mo period, 41, 42, 48 finding no significant change overall. One of these, a randomized controlled trial comparing a letter of condolence (control) to the letter and storytelling (intervention), showed some decrease in the DRS score in some patients in the intervention group. 42 ",

Second, few studies reported negative outcomes as a result of the decision-making process, so it is possible the others reported outcomes that were mostly satisfactory and led to lower levels of regret. 23, 44, 45 For example, one study reported a significantly higher level of regret following screening decisions when the result was not satisfactory. 23 In addition, some studies reported categorical values that may lead to confusion between no regret (DRS = 0) and a low level of regret.

In our review, we found few studies measuring regret longitudinally at multiple time points, and none measured regret over more than 6 mo. One study reported that even with no significant change between groups, the intervention was beneficial in some cases but only to patients who initially presented highest regret. Furthermore, another study specifically on values clarification showed that regret significantly decreased over time (.1 y) when values were clarified. 52 Our study did not give us much insight into repeated measurement of regret over a long period. Further research is required to better understand the evolution of regret over time.",

            "text": "Measuring decision regret among informal caregivers appears to be a new outcome of interest, as studies are few and recent. Moreover, the topic has been studied exclusively in high-income countries. This finding may be explained by the fact that in low-income countries, it is taken for granted that the burden of caring for the incapacitated is mainly carried by family members and caregivers. 53, 54 In high-income countries, where the proportion of the population that is older is increasing, policy makers are beginning to notice family caregivers as playing a crucial role in caring for older adults and often in making health-related decisions on their behalf. If these unremunerated caregivers are no longer able to play this role for some reason, their replacement with paid workers can pose significant problems for health care systems. The staffing problems due to the exclusion of informal caregivers from visiting long-term care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic made this abundantly clear. Moreover, if family caregivers fail to receive the care they need, it is likely that they, too, will need additional health care services. 16, 35, [55] [56] [57] [58] In our review, most identified predictors of regret were evaluated in the context of a medical or surgical decision made by a parent caregiver for their child. 44, 45, 47 The highest DRS scores were reported by a study conducted among parent caregivers. 23 Medical or surgical decision making in pediatric care is particularly psychologically burdensome for parent caregivers. 59, 60 Furthermore, pediatric decision making is complex because of the involvement of parents, health care professionals, and children. 21, [59] [60] [61] Providers must give specific attention and guidance to parent caregivers, especially when involving them in surgical decision making.",

Before decision making occurs, predictors of decision regret may derive from caregivers and/or care recipients. For example, in studies conducted among parent caregivers, increased decision regret was associated with older childhood age. 44 Furthermore, our results also show that caregivers' increased decision regret is associated with an initial desire to avoid making a proxy decision. These caregivers not only regretted the choice they made but also may have regretted not following their initial desire to avoid making a decision altogether. 47 Before a decision-making process take place, it is thus important for providers to evaluate caregivers' comfort regarding decision making and to empower them so they are more confident to face current and future decisions. During the decision-making process itself, the fact that caregivers' perception of effective decision making was associated with decreased DRS scores is a clear indication that shared decision making that continues throughout the care path is an effective counterweight to decision regret. At the stage of decision outcomes, complications or a positive test result were associated with increased decision regret. But if a person has been empowered to make effective decisions beforehand, supported through the process, and finally reassured that the best path possible has been taken, the destructive and distressing spiral of decision regret may be averted. 62",

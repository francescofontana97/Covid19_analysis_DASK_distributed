Recall that 3 is the proliferation rate of CD8 T-cells and 5 is the rate of generation of the innate 233 immune response. The other parameters were fixed (supplementary table S6) at their population 234 estimates, for which the model elicited clearance of the infection by day 14 (figure 3A, center, subplot 235 with an arrowhead). Increasing 5 resulted in a decrease in the peak of infected cells (figure 3A, the row 236 of subplots with arrowhead, right to left). With decrease in 5 , the induction of the cytokine mediated 237 antiviral innate response was substantially delayed and that corresponded to an increased number of 238 infected cells (supplementary figure S4A, B). Clearance was achieved in all cases without substantial 239 variation in the infection duration because of the CD8 T-cell response (figure 3A, the row of subplots 240 with arrowhead, right to left). Decreasing 3 weakened the CD8 T-cell response and increased the 241 duration of the infection (figure 3A, the column of subplots with arrowhead, bottom to top). We next 242 explored the effects of varying both 3 and 5 simultaneously. 243 When 3 was high, i.e., the response of CD8 T-cells was strong, irrespective of the innate immune 244 response, the infection was cleared within ten days (figure 3A, subplots on bottom-left and bottom-right). 245",

The efficient antiviral 275 innate response controlled the initial peak of the infection. However, the slow proliferation of the effector 276 cells delayed clearance. This scenario had parallels to the reported cases of prolonged RT-PCR positivity 277 of viral loads (22-24). Restrained CD8 T-cell differentiation was associated with such cases (22).278Delayed clearance was also realized when the parameter was increased, which increased the antigen 279level required for significant effector T-cell proliferation (figure 3C). These predictions were consistent 280 with observations of defects in T-cell proliferation delaying the clearance of infection (22). 281 When both 3 and 5 were low (figure 3A, four subplots on top-right), severe immunopathology along 282 with prolonged infection with high viral load and high cytokine levels was predicted. When they were the 283 lowest, clearance was not achieved in our simulations. Although, clearance of the infection is the 284 predominant outcome associated with a wide range of parameter values (figure 3), our dynamical systems 285 analysis revealed that in certain parameter regimes clearance may not result (supplementary text section 286 D, supplementary figures S6, S7). Instead, escape from immune protection with a high level of infected 287 cells and cytokines together with a high degree of CD8 T-cell exhaustion may occur. Such runaway 288 trajectories were associated with high immunopathology in our model (figure 3A, top right corner, 289 supplementary figure S3B, S3C, top right corner) and were predicted to be terminated by fatality. These 290 trends in the model mirrored clinical features of severe COVID-19 (45), which include consistently very 291 high viral loads, heightened proinflammatory cytokines and interferons (39, 45, 48), attenuated 292 proliferation (13) and increased exhaustion of T-cells (13, 14, 17). The predictions also include cases 293where in the late phase of the infection, although the viral load in sputum shows a decline (49), and that in 294 nasopharyngeal swab becomes undetectable (33, 39, 49), mortality results due to intolerable 295 immunopathology. 296Note that the initial pool of CD8 T-cells, 0 , was important in determining outcomes (supplementary text 297 section D, supplementary figure S7), with a large pool leading to rapid clearance, in agreement with 298",

            "text": "Factors in addition to the above could contribute to variations in the innate and the CD8 T-cell responses 404 across individuals. For instance, certain mutations, reported in a subset of severe COVID-19 patients, may 405 preclude a potent interferon response (47). A section of severely infected patients is reported to harbor 406 neutralizing autoantibodies against interferons (29, 66). Overzealous production of antibodies against 407 SARS-CoV-2 might inhibit the pathway for interferon-mediated induction of antiviral genes (67). 408Further, in vitro studies suggest that different SARS-CoV-2 proteins can inhibit the TBK1-IRF3 pathway 409or the JAK/STAT pathway at several signaling nodes, adversely affecting interferon production and/or 410 signaling (68). Variability in the CD8 T-cell response may come from different precursor populations, 411due for instance to prior exposure to circulating human coronaviruses (50). Patients pre-exposed to other 412 coronaviruses or rhinoviruses harbor populations of effector T-cells that might cross-react with SARS-413CoV-2 antigens and contribute to the early clearance of the infection (50, 69). Population-level variations 414 in effector cell frequencies (70) and inter-individual heterogeneity in lymphocytic gene expression 415 patterns (71) may also contribute to the variability in the CD8 T-cell response. 416 CD8 T-cell exhaustion has been proposed as an evolutionary design to prevent mortality due to 417 immunopathology (30, 72). By preventing extensive tissue damage due to CD8 T-cell killing of infected 418 cells, exhaustion can avert mortality. The price of reduced CD8 T-cell efficiency is often persistent 419 infection, as seen with HIV and hepatitis C (30). With severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, although extensive 420 CD8 T-cell exhaustion is seen, it appears inadequate to prevent mortality; immunopathology caused by 421 proinflammatory cytokines dominates. Potent activation of the NF-\uf06bB pathway by components of the 422 SARS-CoV-2 virion may trigger the production of detrimental proinflammatory cytokines (73, 74). 423 Heightened interferon expression in the lung (5, 18, 19, 75, 76) impairs cell proliferation, impeding tissue 424 repair after proinflammatory cytokine-mediated immunopathology (77). Moreover, interferons may 425 synergize with proinflammatory cytokines to fuel immunopathology by triggering cell death pathways 426 (78, 79). (Note that interferons may be subdued in peripheral circulation (80), but that appears to be 427 uncorrelated with their expression in the respiratory tract in COVID-19 (5).) In contrast, 428 immunopathology due to CD8 T-cells appears minimal. CD8 T-cells infiltrate the alveolar tissues of 429 COVID-19 patients (76) and can kill infected cells. At the peak of the infection, 10 4 -10 6 cells are 430 estimated to be infected out of the 10 11 estimated target cells in the respiratory tract (81). Thus, direct 431 CD8 T-cell killing of infected cells would affect a small fraction of cells in the respiratory tract. This may 432 also explain why viral persistence has not been observed with SARS-CoV-2 infection: Inducing CD8 T-433 cell exhaustion can only minimally affect immunopathology dominated by cytokines. We speculate that 434 the absence of persistence may be a general feature of those viral infections where immunopathology is 435 predominantly cytokine-mediated. Indeed, hypercytokinemia has been associated with the fatal outcomes 436 following influenza A (H5N1) infection (82). 437 A strategy of great interest today for reinvigorating exhausted CD8 T-cells is the use of immune 438 checkpoint inhibitors (83). The inhibitors are approved for use in certain cancers. Because of their 439 promise, five clinical trials are underway for testing their efficacy in treating severe COVID-19, of which 440",

A major 442 risk of checkpoint inhibitor therapy is increased immunopathology due to a heightened CD8 T-cell 443response. Based on our model predictions and arguments above, we speculate that with COVID-19, the 444 risk of increased immunopathology from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is likely to be minimal, 445given the predominance of cytokine-mediated pathology. Indeed, a retrospective analysis of melanoma 446 patients showed that checkpoint inhibitor therapy did not increase the risk of mortality due to COVID-19 447(85). Rather, the beneficial effects of an improved CD8 T-cell response may outweigh any minimal 448 enhancement in immunopathology.Ourmodel could be applied to understand the implications of other interventions (86) and of emerging 450 viral mutants (87) on disease outcomes. Given the mechanisms of action of available drugs and drug 451 candidates (86), their effects on typical individuals in the mild, moderate and severe infection categories 452 could be predicted using the corresponding nominal parameter estimates we identified for the respective 453 categories. Several recently identified circulating mutants are known to be more infectious than the 454 original SARS-CoV-2 strain and to escape immune responses (88). These characteristics could be 455 incorporated in our model readily by suitably increasing the infectivity and/or decreasing the strength of 456 the immune response, to predict how emerging strains could alter the overall severity of the infection. We 457 recognize that to estimate the effects of such variations at the population level, knowledge of how the 458 parameter values in our model, particularly those defining the innate and CD8 T-cell responses, are 459 distributed across individuals in a population would be required. With hepatitis C virus infection, for 460 instance, the distribution of the strength of interferon responsiveness across individuals quantitatively 461 predicted the fraction of individuals that spontaneously cleared the infection (89, 90) and together with 462 the distribution of the CD8 T-cell response captured the success of interferon-based and other therapies 463 (89-91). Such predictions with SARS-CoV-2, once parameter distributions become available, may help 464 refine clinical and epidemiological projections of healthcare requirements. 465Our study has limitations. First, we neglected the role that cytokines play in the expansion of CD8 T-cells 466(92) because fits of our model incorporating such an effect to the available data were poor (supplementary 467 text section B). Perhaps, a larger patient cohort may improve the fits and allow incorporating the latter 468 effect. Second, our model did not incorporate any negative effect of immunopathology on the immune 469 response; for instance, lymphopenia (15, 93), which is generally thought to be caused by 470immunopathology, could compromise the immune response. Third, we employed a simplified model of 471CD8 T-cell exhaustion, following earlier studies (30-32), which allows exhaustion to be reversed fully 472 upon lowering antigen levels. Recent studies have demonstrated that exhaustion is reversible only in a 473 subset of exhausted cells (83). Notwithstanding, we expect our key inferences on the roles of the innate 474 and the CD8 T-cell responses in determining the heterogeneous outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection to",

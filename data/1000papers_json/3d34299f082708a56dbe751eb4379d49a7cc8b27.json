In contemporary Spanish ophthalmology, it is surprising how many societies are dedicated to sub-specialties and, of course, all have their boards of directors, annual congresses and members fees. Perhaps the Ophthalmology Society of Spain could manage subspecialty meetings, although this could be very complicated due to the unstoppable and sometimes obsessive eagerness to achieve notoriety within the profession.",

This subspecialization culture is reflected in the growing number of Masters or Fellowships offered in the different sub-specialties, which, it must be said, have a significant economic component. However, it is worth reminding resident doctors that the day-to-day reality of care may be less glamorous than the desired sub-specialization, largely for two reasons.",

It is clear that sub-specialization is necessary and unstoppable in ophthalmology, because it allows better quality of care for certain patients, but we believe it is highly recommended to gain a few years of experience as a general ophthalmologist and then consider sub-specialization that can be acquired gradually with the help of other colleagues in the subspecialty and with the recommended individual study. Although it may be a reasonable option, it is not essential to have a master's degree or fellowship in order to achieve the desired subspecialty, as we all know brilliant subspecialists who did not engage in such training.",

The professional work of the general ophthalmologist can be very gratifying since his knowledge allows him to treat many conditions and only in certain cases to refer them to sub-specialists. This requires training in the multiple diagnostic tests and surgical techniques that must go beyond cataract surgery such as not very complex eyelid surgery, tear duct surgery such as dacryocystectomies, laser treatments and intraocular injections, among others. They may even have their own knowledge of general ophthalmology such as bioethics, statistics or hospital management, subjects that are usually forgotten by subspecialists. Being a good general ophthalmologist is an enormous professional challenge, and their healthcare work is as valid and necessary as that of subspecialist ophthalmologists.",

Dr. Li Wenliang was caring for a glaucoma patient who developed fever and cough. 2 Our colleague, instead of making a consultation and not understanding the problem, was interested in following the patient, observed that he had atypical pneumonia and helped to identify the coronavirus etiology, which we now know as SARS-CoV-2. Given his age, it is doubtful that he was a prestigious subspecialist, but he was an extraordinary general ophthalmologist, because in addition to checking for glaucoma he cared for the patient, an attitude that is worthy of admiration, don't you think? r e f e r e n c e s",

Normally distributed measurement data was represented by (\uf8e5X\u00b1s), non-normally distributed measurement data were described by the median, and count data was expressed as a percentage. Measurement data with a reference range of clinical normal values were grouped according to clinical significance according to the upper or lower limit of normal values. If there was no normal value range, the normally distributed measurement data was grouped by the mean value, and the non-normally distributed measurement data was grouped by the median. The independent-sample t-test was used to compare the two means, and the homogeneity of variance was tested by Levene's test (P>0.05 was judged as equal variance). Oneway analysis of variance (One-Way ANOVA) was used for comparison of more than two means (homogeneity of variance analysis by LSD method, P>0.05 Judged as equal variance), and pairwise comparisons between groups were performed.

The above research suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 in the most patients was cleared within two weeks, but we also found some COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive exceed two weeks. The 115 patients enrolled in this study, from the symptom onsets to the first nucleic acid negative time after the nucleic acid turning negative (T2) was 32.5 days (16 to 59 days). Because this study was a retrospective analysis, in order to rule out the prolonged turning negative time due to untimely nucleic acid detection, this study also calculated the last nucleic acid positive time from symptom onsets to virus turning negative(T1), The average time of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f T1 was 28.4 days (14 to 52 days). This result suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance time in this group was far more than two weeks.",

Therefore, we cannot understand as that the prolonged the time of virus clearance was mainly due to severe patients. In addition, antiviral therapy were mainly used with abidor or lopinavirritonavir in our department, so the cases enrolled in this study also used the above two antiviral drugs. In this study, it was found that the time of virus turning negative in the abidor group was shorter than that in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant. However, whether abidor and lopinavir-ritonavir have antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial [9] [10] [11] , so antiviral treatment was not be analyzed as a risk factor in this study. Because glucocorticoids were considered to have side effects on prolonging the time of virus clearance [12, 13] , the use of glucocorticoids was strictly limited in clinical practice, and the number of cases treated with glucocorticoids were significantly less in this group. However, it was found that the time of virus turning negative in the glucocorticoid treatment group was shorter than without glucocorticoid group. Studies by other authors have also found that the application of low-dose glucocorticoids does not prolong the virus clearance time [14] [15] . Therefore, it is still controversial whether glucocorticoids will affect the time of the virus turning negative, and this study did not analyze glucocorticoids as a risk factor. This study found that the time of virus turning negative in the female group or fever group were shorter than that in their control group. And in the group of increased alanine aminotransferase or fasting blood glucose, and the group of decreased albumin or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the time of virus turning negative were longer than that in their control group. The amino acid aminotransferase, fasting blood glucose, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were independent risk factors for the prolongation of virus turning negative by Cox multi-factor regression analysis.",

Based on the evidence of the detrimental value of statistical significance testing and the likely failure in both the published study by Wang et al. (2020) and the unpublished preliminary report by Wehrwein (2020) to analyze their data thoroughly at the case-level and asymmetrically, the available findings are inadequate for FDA granting of remdesivir's emergency use. Wang et al. (2020) published study does not include examining the asymmetric configuration case-level effects for remdesivir versus the placebo as treatment conditions with additional chronic conditions in the same models. The relevant literature is highly supportive that RCT's do not achieve randomness for true randomness and the measurement of treatment effects in case-based, not variable-based, models are necessary (e.g., Schulz, Chalmers, & Hayes, 1999) . Because randomized control trials may include bias in assignments of participants, examination of alternative configurations of treatment and measured variable conditions is another reason for doing so-reliance on low correlations among treatment and measured variables is insufficient because of the inherent biases in correlations and the fact that conditional analysis differs inherently from variable directional relationship analysis. Plainly stated, remdesivir dosages may be effective for patients who are members in one to five profiles of patients but not among patients in general. Note in the findings of the Wang et al. (2020) experiment, remdesivir had negative effects among 66% of the patients in the treatment group versus 50% in the control group receiving the placebo.

It minimizes further spread.\" And it allows health authorities to quickly isolate and treat those found with the virus. Hong Kong and Singapore have followed similar paths in responding to this outbreak. They've used testing aggressively to identify cases-not only testing people who are so sick that they're hospitalized but also mild cases and even suspected cases. They've quarantined tens of thousands of people who may have been exposed to confirmed cases. The vast majority of the people ordered to quarantine at home are perfectly healthy and never do get sick, but the few who do develop symptoms can be quickly isolated further. Tedros of the WHO refers to this as cutting off the virus at the bud-basically stopping the virus from spreading further and preventing community transmission. \u2026 Their experiences with these past outbreaks may have made officials more aggressive in responding to COVID-19 and possibly made residents more willing to accept intrusive measures to contain the virus. South Korea has used data from surveillance cameras, cellphones and credit card transactions to map the social connections of suspected cases. Hong Kong issues detailed information each evening about every newly confirmed case. While Hong Kong doesn't give out the names of those infected, health officials release each person's age, gender, street address, medical symptomsand often the exact location of where the person works. This allows other residents to determine if they might have been in contact with the infected individual. (Beaubien, 2020) 6. Improving the accuracy of forecasting COVID-19s impact Green (2018a, 2018b) offer an assessment on ways to improve the accuracies of forecasts that will shock many modelers using symmetric tools: forecast accuracy is improvable by using one of 15 relatively simple evidence-based forecasting methods. \"One of those methods, knowledge models, provides substantial improvements in accuracy when causal knowledge is good. On the other hand, data models-developed using multiple regression, data mining, neural nets, and \"big data analytics\"-are unsuited for forecasting\" (Armstrong & Green, 2018a , 2018b . Independent evidence supports and extends Green's (2018a, 2018b) assessments. For example, a series of tests from across different kinds of problems-such as the forecasting of high school dropout rates-found that simple heuristics were typically at least as accurate as complex forecasting methods, and often more accurate (Gigerenzer et al, 1999) . McClelland's (1998) research includes failing to find MRA models to be useful and switching to constructing useful asymmetric (algorithm) case-outcome models of complex-X statements to indicate outstanding managers in predictive testing (using new samples of managers). Armstrong, Green, and Graefe (2015) offer the \"Golden Rule in forecasting: be conservative.\" More specifically, to be conservative by adhering to cumulative knowledge about the situation and about forecasting methods. Also, several statistical domain experts concur with the American Statistical Association committee's (Wasserstein, 2016) conclusion on the topic of using null hypothesis significance testing (NHST): avoid doing so. As aptly put, \"Statistical significance testing is detrimental to advances in science\" (Armstrong, 2007a (Armstrong, , 2007b . Because of the pervasive use of NHST in medical research, in particular, and business and behavioral research as well, being blunt is necessary: \"The progress of economic science has been seriously damaged. You can't believe anything that comes out of the Two Sins [testing of directional relationships in both theory and applied work]. Not a word. It is all nonsense, which future generations of economists are going to have to do all over again. Most of what appears in the best journals of economics is unscientific rubbish.

During 1918-1920 and valid today for COVID-19, with no vaccine to protect against influenza infection and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections typically associated with influenza infections, control efforts worldwide were limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings, which were applied unevenly. The following information from shutdown interventions during the 1918-1920 flu is relevant today. In the U.S., the lowest deaths per 100,000 were all in the nine cities with the longest social distancing periods: Minneapolis (267 deaths per 100,000), Indianapolis (290) (807) (Markel et al., 2017) . Building a case-based model the includes time length of cities in quintiles of social distancing and length of time of time of shutdowns, and frequency of testing per capita of cities in quintiles to predict top cities lowest in deaths per capita, might be a consistently accurate model-a model worth testing later in 2020 in separate models for the data in Markel et al. (2017) and the forthcoming data for COVID-19. Green (2018a, 2018b) recommend applying Occam's razor for increasing the accuracy in forecasting. The \"simplicity principle\" (Occam's razor) is the scientific principle that the simplest explanation of evidence is the best. Applying Green's (2018a, 2018b) first (of a few) rules for accurate forecasting, be conservative, construct forecasts using knowledge-based methods, and apply the simplicity principle, constructing a rapid forecast of outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic is possible using data from the 1918-1920 flu. The frequently stated deaths for the 1918-1920 flu is 675,000 Americans. The U.S. population in 1919 was 104,514,000. Using the ratio of 675,000/104,514,000, 0.646% of Americans will die by the end of 2, 112, 000 souls) . Given the improvements in medicines in 2020 versus 1918, the potential arrival of an effective preventive vaccine in 2021, and the end of profound incompetency if Trump is defeated, and shift from 25% toward 70% herd immunity, the prediction might be lowered conservatively to 1.5 million. However, Meehl (1954) concluded that forecasters should not make subjective adjustments to forecasts made by quantitative methods. \"Since then, research in psychology has continued to support Meehl's findings (see Grove, Zald, Lebow, Snitz, & Nelson, 2000) . Research on adjusting forecasts from statistical models found that adjustments often increase errors (e.g. Belvedere & Goodwin, 2017; Fildes & Goodwin, 2007) or have mixed results (e.g. Franses, 2014; Lin, Goodwin, & Song, 2014 )\" (Armstrong & Green, 2018a , 2018b .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 834, "end": 855, "text": "(Markel et al., 2017)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1236, "text": "Markel et al.

Overly conservative forecasts of impact of COVID-19 may be a hallmark of organizations initially from an industry perspective. The estimates of COVID-19 impacts on the sector by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) have been substantially revised between early and late March. \"A 6 March 2020 press release from UNWTO (2020a) estimated the pandemic would cause international tourist arrivals to decline 1-3% (compared to 2019) rather than the forecasted 3-4% growth. Three weeks later, on 26 March, a press release updated this assessment to a 20-30% loss in international arrivals (UNWTO, 2020b)\" (G\u00f6ssling, Scott, & Hall, 2020) . Based on estimating for the entire length of the COVID-19 disaster, the forecasts for losses in international arrivals are likely to continue to fall-six weeks was a frequent forecast for the war's length among soldiers both in the Union and in the Confederate armies during the first months of the U.S. Civil War.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 171, "end": 195, "text": "Armstrong & Green, 2018a", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 196, "end": 203, "text": ", 2018b", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1338, "text": "(G\u00f6ssling, Scott, & Hall, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "COVID-19 deaths in"}, {"text": "Unlike the initial overestimates of deaths due to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that caused a major industry to collapse, COVID-19s impact may be hard to overestimate-given the extraordinary high devastation during April and May 2020. \"The 2003 SARS outbreak devastated Asian tourism. The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC 2003) estimated that up to three million people in the industry lost their jobs in the most severely affected jurisdictions of China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam and that the outbreak cost these four economies over $20 billion in lost GDP. Tourism arrivals also fell by 70% or more across the rest of Asia, even in countries that were largely or totally disease-free.

The initial industry underestimates of SARS 2003 impact by UNWTO may be due to the lack of data availability relative to the size of the danger to public health. The use of historical data on multiple pandemics for forecasting the scope and size of the danger of a present pandemic may be very helpful. Pandemics can last for centuries and dramatically reduce total populations (Scheidel, 2017, Chapter 11 )-reasons enough to label the closing of the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense in 2017 as one of many profoundly incompetent steps by the Trump administration starting in 2016.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 342, "end": 353, "text": "(WTTC 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 910, "end": 942, "text": "(McKercher & Chon, 2004, p. 716)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1350, "text": "(Scheidel, 2017, Chapter 11", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "COVID-19 deaths in"}, {"text": "Framing interventions as experiments helps signal the need for achieving accurate forecasts of the size and scope of the current and future devastation, the design and implementation of valid experimental designs that control for sources of invalidity, and the selection of valid research tools for measuring the short and long-term impacts of the interventions.

The main take-aways from this essay might be that effective and ineffective responses to a mega-pandemic may vary substantially among nations and states within nations and sufficient time is available in 2020 for the U.S. to shift from its current relatively ineffectual response to a highly effectual intervention to COVID-19; much beloved Reagan (1981) was mistaken in stating during his U.S. presidential 1981 inaugural address, \"Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.\" Coordinated, major, national government actions are necessary to mitigate and eliminate pandemics, civil rights violations, guns, corruption, extrene income inequality, misogamy, and other national disasters. Government action is necessary but not sufficient for mitigating and eventually eliminating on-going disasters.

Motivated by this, we leverage financial event streams to train a classification neural network that detects latent event-stock linkages and stock markets' systematic behaviours in the U.S. stock market. Our proposed pipeline includes (1) a combined event extraction method that utilizes Open Information Extraction and neural co-reference resolution, (2) a BERT/ALBERT enhanced representation of events, and (3) an extended hierarchical attention network that includes attentions on event, news and temporal levels. Our pipeline achieves significantly better accuracies and higher simulated annualized returns than state-of-the-art models when being applied to predicting Standard&Poor 500, Dow Jones, Nasdaq indices and 10 individual stocks. arXiv:2010.15586v1 [q-fin.ST]",

Regarding the rich information included in daily published news articles, we are encouraged to read them not by ourselves but by employing deep learning algorithms to guide our investments. One solution is to automatically collect thousands of news published every day, extract financial events from the news, and rank the importance of the events to predict market behaviours. In particular, we are aiming at quantifying the latent relevance of between financial event streams and target stocks' price volatilities.",

For example, bad news for one company could be worse news to its downstream supply-chain partner companies yet good news to its competitors. It is time-consuming and untrackable to annotate news manually and train a sentiment analysis model on it, considering that the generalization of the model to novel financial events is fragile. Second, how shall we express the impact of the news published in different days? Generally, news articles have their individual and accumulated influences to the investors. For example, billion-dollar mergers and acquisitions frequently bring bigger and longer impact than adding a new member to the board. Third, regarding that news articles are too long to be generalized for comparison, how to extract shorter, high-level summarized and complete financial events from news? There are factual and opinion-level events expressed in news and their appearance order matters for concluding the news. Finally, how to measure the similarities among financial events guided by historical stock movements? The latent-space representation of events empowers the generalization ability of a machine learning model for predicting event-volatility based on representing and projecting novel events into existing event representation space.",

The drawbacks that we find are (1) one news include hundreds to thousands words and it is difficult to select representative words from them to fit the final stock movement prediction task, and (2) too long news prevents the generalization ability of being embedded for financial information similarity computing. Generally, our proposed network can be seen as a combination of events (Ding et al., 2014 (Ding et al., , 2019 represented by deep pretrained contextualized language models (Devlin et al., 2019) inside a hierarchical attention mechanisms (Hu et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016) .

We attach a classification token [CLS] at the beginning of an event and then execute BERT to obtain the representation tensor of the event.

It is possible that we sell out all the indices or stocks, then hold the cash, and buy them (top-5) back when there is predicted a UP or UP+ the next day.

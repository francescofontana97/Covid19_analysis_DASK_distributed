Benefits to deferring the second dose are influenced by the length of deferral, one dose efficacy, and vaccine supply per capita.

            "text": "The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic has inspired the creation of multiple effective vaccines, including a new type of vaccine using mRNA by Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT 162b2). Given the urgency of the pandemic and unknown immunogenicity of this new vaccine type, the manufacturers appeared to select doses at the highest tolerated level and spaced them with a short time frame to achieve a quick restimulation of the immune response. This sensible approach worked better than most would have anticipated, with a two dose efficacy rate of stopping symptomatic COVID at 94-95% in trial data (1, 2) , with reports from Israeli health agencies Maccabi and Cialit reporting similar figures in Israel's population (3) . Surprisingly, one dose efficacy against symptomatic disease was also very high 93-94% in trial data (2, 4) with multiple sources of data around the world confirming a 80% to 90% one dose efficacy once sufficient time is given for the immune system to mount a response (5, 6, 7) . Lower viral titres in those who had received one dose that do get infected would point to decreased transmission of virus even without the second dose (8) and asymptomatic infections also appear to be reduced by 4 fold (9) . Our previous model showed that even high estimates of decay rates for one dose efficacy were highly unlikely to nullify the benefit to population immunity that was gained by deferring the second dose (10) . To the best of the authors' knowledge, how this benefit changes with different spacing regimens as well as how it changes with vaccine availability has not yet been evaluated.",

This modelling evaluates a population receiving vaccine shipments increasing by 10% per week such that the entire population can be fully immunized in 14 months. We also evaluated how to adjust these results for regions with higher or lower available vaccine supply per capita, given the size of the population and the available vaccine will vary by region. Decay rate of efficacy after 2 doses of the vaccine is set at 1% per month, and for one dose the decay rate is set at 2.5% per month, unless otherwise noted. A one dose efficacy of 93% and a two dose efficacy of 95% were used in our modelling, based on the trial data seen in Pfizer/BioNTech's phase 3 data (1, 2). The total average population immunity was determined by calculating the area under the curve (unpublished data). Growth of the vaccine shipments were modelled at 10% increase per month. Immunity effects were realized two weeks after the respective doses were given.",

Absolute population immunity gains of 2-20 percentage points were seen. These gains are increased significantly if the vaccine supply is more robust, see . Viewed from another angle, a given population immunity level was reached from 1.5 to 10.5 weeks quicker by deferring the second dose.

If a region has a more robust vaccine supply per capita so that they can fully vaccinate their population within 40 weeks, that will modify the magnitude of benefit modelled. Namely, this increases the gain in population immunity, but the gain in time to reach a set immunity is relatively unchanged. Alternatively, for regions expecting to take longer than a year to vaccinate their population, lower gains with population immunity would be expected if the same spacing regimen was used. The influence of vaccine supply can be illustrated by comparing the 24 week spacing gains shown in Figure 7 , which shows a population with robust vaccine supply per capita, as well as medium supply, and low supply. The more robust the vaccine supply, the greater the increase of population immunity for a 12 week spacing compared to a 3 week spacing regimen. The 24 week spacing compared to the 3 week spacing regimen illustrates a gain of 78% for robust vaccine supply, 58% for medium vaccine supply, and 26% for low supply. These correspond to absolute population immunity percentage point increases of 32, 19, and 15, respectively. With a very robust vaccine supply, a 24 week spacing regimen is not needed as the entire population will be able to receive their first dose 24 weeks has passed, see Figure 8 .",

There are multiple reasons why the COVID-19 recovered cohort might get vaccinated, including maximizing individual immunity for those at high risk and inadvertently vaccinating those who had asymptomatic infections. However, deferring the first dose of vaccine for this cohort until everyone else has received their first dose is optimal from a population immunity perspective, a factor that public health organizations should consider when implementing a distribution plan.",

AstraZeneca's one dose trial data showed sustained one dose immunity for at least 12 weeks (13), but given that it did not use the novel mRNA vaccine technology, the concern around one dose duration was still valid. However, with multiple ongoing studies evaluating one dose efficacy duration of the mRNA vaccines (such as in Quebec and the UK), this risk has greatly been diminished. Any region that now implements a second dose deferred strategy -weeks after these other trials have started -will have sufficient notice of when one dose efficacy decays, as long as they monitor these other public health authorities' data. In other words, the duration of one dose efficacy for the mRNA vaccines is still not known, but it will be known soon, and should give ample leeway to inform the optimal time to give the second dose for this new mRNA vaccine technology.",

One strategy would be to defer the second dose only until all high risk individuals have first received their first dose, and then the second dose is given as vaccine supply allows. Once the high risk group has received both doses, the same distribution strategy is implemented for the medium and low risk groups, respectively. Given that the elderly may have a level of immune senescence leading to a delayed response to the vaccine (14) , with possibly a lower one dose efficacy than the initial trial data suggested (15) , this may be a prudent option. This appears to be the strategy Quebec is taking, as it optimizes immunity for the most vulnerable (6) , and focusing vaccination on the elderly appears to prevent the most deaths as well as minimizing total expected years lost (16) .",

Individuals who have been infected with COVID-19 have shown dramatic and robust responses to a single dose of a mRNA vaccine even 10 months after recovery, even in people whose antibodies have waned to unmeasurable levels (17) . Furthermore, AstraZeneca's data showed improved immunity with a 12 week spacing window compared to less than 6 week spacing (13) . This helps allay this concern to a certain degree, but the optimal spacing for a booster dose may differ after infection or based on using different vaccine technology. A reasonable way to evaluate this might be to give a second dose to a small sample of the population every week during the deferral period and ensure they have large increases in their immune markers consistent with a boost response. When (or if) the immune markers stop having a robust increase as expected, then that would help determine the maximal spacing to optimally restimulate the immune system.",

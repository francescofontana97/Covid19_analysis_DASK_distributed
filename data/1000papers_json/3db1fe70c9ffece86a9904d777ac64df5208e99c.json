We developed a comprehensive mathematical framework based on the known mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, incorporating the renin-angiotensin system and ACE2, which the virus exploits for cellular entry, key elements of the innate and adaptive immune responses, the role of in ammatory cytokines and the coagulation cascade for thrombus formation. The model predicts the evolution of viral load, immune cells, cytokines, thrombosis, and oxygen saturation based on patient baseline condition and the presence of co-morbidities. Model predictions were validated with clinical data from healthy people and COVID-19 patients, and the results were used to gain insight into identi ed risk factors of disease progression including older age, co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, and dysregulated immune response 1,2 . We then simulated treatment with various drug classes to identify optimal therapeutic protocols. We found that the outcome of any treatment depends on the sustained response rate of activated CD8 + T cells and su cient control of the innate immune response. Furthermore, the best treatment -or combination of treatments -depends on the pre-infection health status of the patient. Our mathematical framework provides important insight into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and could be used as the basis for personalized, optimal management of COVID-19.",

Because of the systemic in ammation seen in many patients, anti-in ammatory drugs have been tested, including anti-IL6/IL6R therapy (e.g., tocilizumab, siltuximab) and anti-JAK1/2 drugs (e.g. barcitinib). It is not clear if these drugs will be effective as stand-alone treatments, particularly after the recent failure of tocilizumab in a phase III trial 3, [24] [25] [26] . In addition, given that a common complication of COVID-19 is the development of coagulopathies with microvascular thrombi potentially leading to the dysfunction of multiple organ systems 4, 5 , anti-thrombotic drugs (e.g., low molecular weight heparin) are being tested. Recognizing the interactions of COVID-19 with the immune system 27 , the corticosteroid dexamethasone have been tested, showing some promising results. Given the large range of patient comorbidities, disease severities, and variety of complications such as thrombosis, it is likely that patients will have heterogeneous responses to any given therapy, and such heterogeneity will continue to be a challenge for clinical trials of unselected COVID-19 patients 28 .",

Our model incorporates the known mechanisms of SARS CoV-2 pathogenesis and the potential mechanisms of action of various therapeutic interventions that have been tested in COVID-19 patients. In previous work, we have exploited angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) for the improvement of cancer therapies and developed mathematical models of the renin-angiotensin system in the context of cancer desmoplasia [29] [30] [31] [32] . Using a similar approach, we developed a detailed model that includes lung infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model of infection and thrombosis to simulate events that take place throughout the body during COVID-19 progression (Figure 1 and Supplementary   Figure 1 ). The model is rst validated against clinical data of healthy people and COVID-19 patients and then used to simulate disease progression in patients with speci c co-morbidities. Subsequently, we present model predictions for various therapies currently employed for treatment of COVID-19 alone or in combination, and we identify protocols for optimal clinical management for each of the clinically-observed COVID-19 phenotypes.",

SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by docking to ACE2, a key component of the RAS. ACE2 can be membrane-bound or soluble, and it regulates in ammation by converting Ang II to Ang 1-7 and Ang I to Ang 1-9; as opposed to Ang I and Ang II, which lead to in ammation. Ang 1-7 and Ang 1-9 have anti-in ammatory effects. Intracellular virus initiates in ammatory pathways through toll-like receptors and NFkB, which produces interferons and other in ammatory cytokines. The viral antigens, along with in ammatory cytokines, cause activation of na\u00efve T cells, creating virus-speci c T effector cells. T cell activation is controlled by viral antigen strength and the presence of PD-L1 / PD-1 inhibition. We combine in ammatory cytokines into a single variable, but explicitly account for IL6 production via the trans pathway in epithelial and endothelial cells and the canonical pathway in immune cells. In the presence of in ammatory cytokines and virus, neutrophils can produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).",

Infection of endothelial cells, combined with high levels of in ammatory cytokines in the plasma, can result in thrombosis. Damage to virally-infected endothelial cells and the production of NETs can exacerbate the thrombosis, and microthrombi can enter the blood stream to accumulate in other organs, including the brain, heart and lung. We use a simpli ed model of the coagulation pathways, assuming that formation of microthrombi is proportional to the number of infected endothelial cells, the presence of neutrophil NETs, and the level of in ammatory cytokines. Transport of oxygen from the alveolar space to the blood vessels in the lung is calculated using a modi ed diffusion model, which accounts for damage-induce thickening of the alveolar membrane 33 .",

We used the model to predict the time evolution of critical disease variables, namely the virus load, levels of IL6 and other pro-in ammatory cytokines, the formation of microthrombi in the lung, the numbers of neutrophils, macrophages and activated cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, and the blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). The COVID-19 patient phenotypes considered include young patients (age<35), older patients (age>65) who more frequently require hospitalization, female patients, as well as patients with co-morbidities such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, and patients with a dysregulated immune response, whose condition is characterized by high levels of pro-in ammatory cytokines ( Figure 3 ). Supplementary Table 2 presents the model parameters that were modi ed from the baseline values to account for these various patient phenotypes. In all phenotypes, the viral load increases during early lung infection with divergent trajectories seen after day 5, depending on the levels of activated T cells. In younger patients (age<35) with a healthy immune system, the sustained recruitment of T cells results in a reduction in viral load and in ammation, as well as a decrease in neutrophils and macrophages. All these effects cause a signi cant reduction in the formation of thrombi and restoration of oxygenation.",

The anti-viral remdesivir is effective in reducing viral load in early stages, but less effective in reducing thrombus formation and improving oxygenation. Interestingly, dexamethasone is helpful when started later, but early administration can prevent the production of activated T cells, making it di cult to reduce the viral load. This mirrors the data from the RECOVERY trial, where dexamethasone was demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients requiring ventilatory support, but not in those with milder symptoms. These simulations also identify IL-6 directed therapies as potential therapeutics that may bene t patients if started early in the disease course. As far as inhibitors of the RAS are concerned, both ARBs and ACEi show modest bene ts only when administered early, whereas the model predicts a signi cant bene t from the use of hrACE2 on day 7, but not day 3.",

            "text": "Optimizing clinical management of COVID-19 by combining therapies Because of the diverse mechanisms involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis, clinical management currently involves combination of multiple therapies in an effort to optimize therapeutic outcomes. To investigate the effects of combination treatments, we performed simulations combining various therapeutic approaches in pairs, using the best treatment time for each single treatment (i.e., day 3 or day 7, Table 1 ). We also accounted for older patients and those with co-morbidities and dysregulated immune responses. Table 2 presents a summary of the combined treatments for older patients (>65 years); the results for the other COVID-19 phenotypes are presented in Supplementary Tables 3-6. According to the model predictions, effective clinical management of older patients (with some baseline in ammation and impaired adaptive immunity) involves combination of heparin (day 3) with dexamethasone (day 7), which can improve oxygenation and decrease micro-thrombosis signi cantly; however, these treatments have little effect on viral load. For patients with obesity or hypertension, the combination of heparin with dexamethasone is again bene cial compared to other treatments. In addition, the use of anti-IL6/anti-IL6R therapy could also be considered in both these patient populations. For diabetic patients, the combination of heparin with dexamethasone can improve oxygenation and thrombus formation similar to the other scenarios. Other treatments predicted to be bene cial for this phenotype is the combination of dexamethasone with hrACE2 or anti-IL6/anti-IL6R. These combination therapies in diabetic patients can treat hypoxemia and coagulation but also reduce the viral load. For patients with dysregulated immune systems, early blockade of IL6 combined with dexamethasone on day 7 give optimal results; anti-IL6/anti-IL6R combined with anti-viral therapy and/or heparin could also be considered.",

As with other critical care syndromes such as septic shock, and non-COVID-19 ARDS disease severity results from a complex interplay of viral replication, adaptive and maladaptive immune response and patient comorbidities. Such heterogeneity is a challenge to the development of effective therapies as candidate approaches may elicit different responses depending on the phase of illness or patient comorbidities. Because of the complexity of the underlying mechanisms and interactions among the various components involved in the disease, the response of COVID-19 patients to any treatment is not intuitive and for that reason we developed a highly sophisticated mathematical model to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and predict optimal treatment strategies.",

A sustained activation of CD8 + T cells along with the control of the populations of neutrophils and macrophages can lead to a decrease in viral load and in ammation. This, in turn, will improve arterial oxygen saturation levels due to the decreased endothelial damage and micro thrombosis, and limited formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) 42 . In line with these conclusions about the underlying mechanisms of the disease, our model predicts that anti-viral and anti-in ammatory drugs that were rst employed to treat COVID-19 might have limited e cacy, depending on the stage of the disease progression. Furthermore, our simulations suggest that an optimal approach would be to enhance the adaptive immune response in the early stages while limiting harmful in ammation in the later stages of the disease. We also found that addition of heparin to the treatment regimen of COVID-19 can improve therapeutic outcomes. In case of patients with co-morbidities (obesity, diabetes, hypertension) or dysregulated immunity, the treatment regimen could further include anti-in ammatory drugs (e.g., anti-IL6/anti-IL6R) and RAS inhibitors and hrACE2 for the diabetic patients in particular.",

For these parameters, it was necessary to make reasonable assumptions about their values, as summarized in Supplementary Table 1 . We further validated the model predictions quantitatively with available clinical data for healthy and infected humans and qualitatively based on clinical observations for the different COVID-19 phenotypes. Our mathematical framework can be further re ned as new mechanisms and more data become available and can be adapted for other diseases similar to COVID-19.",

For instance, heparin use might be associated with hemorrhage and RAS inhibitors can reduce blood pressure. Even though incorporation of adverse effects could be important, they would not affect the basic conclusions of the study and were omitted to avoid adding further complexity to the model. In conclusion, this study presents a mathematical representation of the known mechanisms of COVID-19 and could be utilized by the scienti c community as a useful tool for further understanding the disease and investigating the bene ts of treatments on a patient-speci c basis. To study how the virus affects systemic events, such as in ammation and thrombosis, we coupled the lung model with a PK/PD model of viral infection. The PK/PD model represents the major organs of the body as compartments connected in an anatomical manner by the blood and lymphatic circulations (Supplementary Figure 1) . The organ compartments are then further subdivided into vascular and extravascular sub-compartments, and each organ has a draining lymph node compartment. Brie y, the main transport processes for the biochemical species include: i) convective and diffusive transport across capillary walls, ii) reversible, non-saturable, nonspeci c binding in the extravascular compartments, iii) reversible, and saturable, speci c binding of virus to endothelial cells, and probabilistic infection of bound cells. Any infected cell generates microthrombi, which enter the circulation and can accumulate in target organs including brain, heart and lung. Each species can be produced, bound or degraded within each compartment. Blood ow is distributed according to known ows through each organ, and the overall mass balance allows calculation of the concentration of each species in each compartment over time. The PK/PD model includes the following key processes involved in the tra cking of viruses: i) transport from the lung via the systemic circulation, ii) entry into endothelial cells via binding to ACE2, iii) entry into the cell and replication, iv) exit from the cell and entry into the blood circulation. The important outputs of the model are the level of thrombosis in each organ and the viral load. When coupled with the lung model, we are able to analyze the dynamics of these readouts in light of local lung pathologies and predicted cytokine levels. Data availability.

The mathematical model consists of two components: a detailed model of lung infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model of COVID-19 infection and thrombosis to simulate events that happen throughout the body (Figure 1). The lung model incorporates the infection of epithelial and endothelial cells by the SARS-CoV-2 virus through ACE2 modulation and activity, the release of pro-in ammatory cytokines and the entire RAS. Cytokines that are central to COVID-19 (e.g., IL-6) are explicitly accounted for in the model, incorporating all known signaling pathways, such as the canonical and trans signaling pathway of IL-6 and its interaction with IL-6r and soluble IL-6r. Additional innate immune cells, speci cally neutrophils and macrophages, are incorporated into our model along with the interaction of immune cells with viral particles and infected cells as well as the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The model incorporates the recruitment of cytotoxic T cells by the infected cells and by IL-6 as well as the virus killing of cytotoxic T cells. In addition, the model accounts for the role of immune cells in modulating the expression of proin ammatory cytokines. Subsequent events, such as the impairment of the vascular network owing to the infection of endothelial cells by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the resulting changes in blood oxygenation are also included.",

Therefore, day 0 of the simulations corresponds to the initiation of lung infection. For the formulation of the model and the solution of the equations, the commercial nite elements software COMSOL Multiphysics v.5.5 was used. The computational nite element mesh employed in the present study consisted of 2,440 elements resulting in 1,201,044 degrees of freedom.

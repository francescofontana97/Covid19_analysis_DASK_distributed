            "text": "The global epidemic of (mis)information, spreading rapidly via social media platforms and other outlets, can be a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders among vulnerable individuals. Cyberchondria can be a vulnerability factor for developing anxiety in a pandemic situation, particularly when the Internet is flooded with (mis)information. The aim of our study was to examine how cyberchondria is related to changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. Repeated cross-sectional data collection was conducted during two waves over a period of three weeks (N1 = 888; N2 = 966). The first began on the day of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Croatia (February 24th, 2020) and the second wave began three weeks later, on the day the first COVID-19 fatality was recorded in Croatia (March 19th, 2020). Participants completed an online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention (information seeking, avoidance and hygiene) and a measure of cyberchondria (Short Cyberchondria Scale, SCS). We analysed whether changes to the epidemiological situation during the period between the two waves of data collection led to an increase in COVID-19 related behaviour directly and indirectly via an increase in COVID-19 concerns. The results indicated that, between the two waves of research, there was a pronounced increase in concerns regarding COVID-19 (b = 1.11, p < .001) as well as significant behavioural changes (b = 1.18-2.34, p < .001). Also, results demonstrated that cyberchondria plays a moderating role in these changes. In the first wave, persons with severe cyberchondria were already intensely concerned with safety behaviours. High cyberchondria and high levels of concern about the COVID-19 are associated with intense avoidance behaviours, R 2 = .63, p < .001. A moderated partial mediation model was confirmed, in which the effect of the epidemiological situation was weaker for those with higher results on the SCS (as indicated by index of moderated mediation between -.10 and -.15, p < .05). As such, cyberchondria is a contributing factor to long-term anxiety and its impact during pandemic on the general mental health burden should therefore be further investigated.",

When today's confrontation with infectious outbreaks is put into historical context, we might argue that modern society is in a much better position given the development of a science that searches for causes and methods of treatment, a health system that can provide adequate care to many people and information connectivity that allows for high-speed exchange of information. However, while addressing the physical consequences of infectious diseases is better than ever before, the psychological effects of such outbreaks are widespread and probably more serious. Previous research has demonstrated that a pandemic can have a wide range of psychosocial impacts. On a personal level, people are likely to experience fear for their health, family, safety or finances [1] . On a social level, there is a danger of stigmatization and marginalization of persons who have been in contact with the virus or have been infected [2] .",

As a result, an imminent threat was perceived in other parts of the world even before a single COVID-19 case was recorded in a given country. Indeed, the World Health Organization declared that we currently face two major threats to our health: the pandemic and an 'infodemic' [3] .",

The ability to spread information quickly during the pandemic has proven to have numerous advantages in that it has enabled health systems to prepare for the epidemic and allowed individuals to understand the seriousness of the threat. Incoming information has also served to raise anxiety, which has, in turn, prompted the swift and widespread adoption of safety behaviours propagated by health authorities. From the time that COVID-19 became a global issue in January 2020, universally recommended safety behaviours such as hygiene measures (washing hands, cleaning surfaces), avoidance of social contact, staying at home and wearing a protective mask have been communicated to individuals via mass media. In addition to these individual recommendations, governments worldwide ordered lockdowns to prevent social gatherings and further spread of the virus.",

            "text": "Croatia is a southern European country that shares a sea border with Italy. Since the beginning of February 2020, the COVID-19 crisis has been top news while the country awaited its' first confirmed case. The first case of COVID-19 in Croatia was identified on February 24, 2020. Lockdown was declared on March 16 th , and the first fatality due to COVID-19 was recorded on March 19, 2020. The lock-down measures declared were among the strictest in the EU and included closing schools, shops and all public transport and all social gatherings for more than four people. After lockdown, press conferences of the National Civil Protection Headquarters were held daily, initially twice a day and later once a day. There were constant appeals in the media for citizens to voluntarily implement protective measures such as handwashing and physical isolation along with the #stay-at-home recommendation. Unfortunately, sensationalist portrayals of the situation, such as the preparation of large sport centres as temporary hospitals, and the broadcasting of disturbing images from hospitals in Italy and Spain were not avoided. These latter forms of information were especially present on social media. To date (May 25, 2020), the number of patients with COVID-19 in Croatia is among the lowest in Europe (542/million inhabitants, fatality rate is 23/million), a trend that has been attributed to the implementation of quarantine-like measures at an early stage. Research examining psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic in Croatia [10] demonstrated a dramatic increase in concern and safety behaviours among participants during the three-week period between the first identified case and the first fatality. Interestingly, there is a discordance between those who are at most risk for serious consequences of the disease and those who are at greatest risk for maladaptive anxiety. Specifically, parents, and mothers in particular, represent the most concerned group, regardless of age. These findings suggest the presence of misplaced health-anxiety and health-protective behaviours and, longitudinal research is certainly justified in order to determine whether more lasting consequences will be present. Previous experiences with public crises that had extensive media coverage, such as an epidemic or terrorist attack, have been demonstrated to leave an unintended psychological burden for people at relatively low risk for direct exposure [7] .",

Cyberchondria has been described relatively recently as behaviour characterized by excessive online searching for medical information associated with increasing levels of health anxiety [12, 13] . A pandemic situation, where media is flooded with ambiguous information, is certainly anxiety provoking. Excessive online searching for health information can itself represent a safety-seeking behaviour (e.g., researching whether symptoms are a sign of a viral infection) and, as a result of potentially disturbing information, can trigger or reinforce further safety-seeking behaviour (e.g., further/excessive Internet use) [7, [13] [14] [15] . Recent research has found that, during pandemics such as COVID-19, cyberchondria affects people's threat appraisal and motivates people to adopt recommended health measures more promptly [7] . Conversely, it can be a risk factor for overly heightened concern, catastrophizing and social distancing, which all have a pathological influence on mental health [16] .",

We tested the model with cyberchondria as predictor of safety behaviours, COVID concerns as mediator and wave of collecting data as moderator. We hypothesize the following: (I) higher cyberchondria is directly associated with higher COVID-19 concerns and more pronounced safety behaviour, inlucding gathering information, avoidance and protection; (II) cyberchondria is indirectly associated with safety behaviours via the COVID-19 concerns as mediator; (III) in the second wave of collection of the data concerns, safety behaviours and cyberchondria will be more pronounced; (IV) the wave has a moderation role in the relationship between cyberchondria, COVID-19 concerns safety behaviours, such that in the second wave those relationships will be weaker.

The internal consistency of all scales was calculated as McDonald's omega and Cronbach alpha coefficient. These analyses were performed using the R software (packages psych, lavaan, semTools) [25, 26] . Finally, we tested three moderated mediation models, one for each of the behaviour subscales, using PROCESS macro for SPSS [27] .

Cyberchondria was not related to Avoidance Behaviour in the second wave (b = .19 vs. .03) and was equally related to Protection Behaviour on both waves (insignificant interaction of SCS and occasion: b = -0.06). Generally, most of the effects related to Protective Behaviour are smaller when compared to other behaviours, including this interaction effect, which might be the effect of the smaller reliability of this variable. These moderated relationships are presented in Fig 1. The relationships between anxiety and behaviour have a similar pattern as those for cyberchondria and behaviour ( Table 5) .",

Our results indicate that, in the first three weeks of the outbreak, there was a significant increase in cyberchondria and COVID-19 related anxiety and safety behaviours.

Indeed, it can be argued that this study e captured the unfolding situation during the first few weeks of the virus outbreak, where the first wave of data collection was initiated when the first case of infection was confirmed and, at the outset of the second wave of data collection, there were 105 confirmed cases and the first recorded fatality. In these three weeks, Croatia implemented very high-level restrictions that were among the strictest in the EU [28] and achieved the targeted linear epidemic curve. Overall, Croatia had a low number of diagnosed cases: on the 23 rd of May (the first day without a single new case), there were 2234 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 99 fatalities. However, the price of this slow spread of the virus was an atmosphere of fear that was fuelled by statements from authorities that were constantly repeated in the media. It seems reasonable to assume that such an atmosphere could contribute to an increase in anxiety and concern among all citizens. The COVID-19 pandemic is unique in its global nature and in the intensity of the measures introduced. Therefore, it is important to capture and describe the phenomenology of citizens' reaction in different parts of the world in efforts to understand people's experience and behaviour in such extraordinary circumstances. This becomes especially important in the event of a predicted second pandemic wave.",

Participants expressed the lowest concern for becoming infected with the SARS-Cov-2 virus, with around one-third of participants at the second measurement point expressing much or very much concern. However, this does represent an increase in concern from the first wave, where just under 20% said they were concerned. When all items are considered together, 27% of participants in the first wave express moderate to severe anxiety. In the second wave, this percentage jumps to more than 72%, which is consistent with previous studies examining anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in other countries [29, 30] . Of course, direct comparison with other research has been hampered using different anxiety measures, ranging from general anxiety measures to pandemic-specific scales [31] [32] [33] . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, research by Wang [29] demonstrated that around 30% of participants from the general population had elevated anxiety (as measured by general anxiety measures), while around 75% of participants had elevated levels of COVID-19 related anxiety. In another study conducted at the beginning of the virus outbreak in Germany, authors found that around 50% of participants from the general population expressed moderate to severe COVID-19 anxiety [29] .",

Wearing face masks was the least frequently adopted behaviour (3% in the first wave and 17.6% in the second wave), despite having been shown to have an effect in preventing the transmission of infection.

As we expected, people exhibiting high levels of cyberchondria at the beginning of the virus outbreak developed higher levels of COVID-19 concern and implemented more safety behaviours. These results are consistent with a number of previous studies examining the role of cyberchondria in the psychological response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A study conducted in Germany with 1615 participants demonstrated that cyberchondria combined with health anxiety is associated with strong virus anxiety [29] . Similarly, data from Finland from a study with 225 participants indicated that cyberchondria influenced one's perceptions of perceived severity and perceived vulnerability for COVID-19and also played a significant role in motivating people to adopt recommended health measures [7] . The results of the present study indicate direct effects of cyberchondria on behaviour and indirect effects via anxiety, although the indirect effects were somewhat weaker, suggesting that cyberchondria is related to behaviour in a way other than via anxiety. It might be argued that cyberchondria prompted the perception of situation severity and thus a readiness to accept recommended safety behaviours. If cyberchondria is conceptualized using a cognitive-behavioural model, compulsive Internet searching might be viewed as a safety-seeking behaviour for reducing health anxiety. Although infectious diseases represent a health-anxiety provoking situation, they are also distinct from other health threats in that the disease can be prevented if one does not come into contact with the source of the infection. In the case of the COVID-19 disease, this is possible by adhering to hygienic measures and avoiding contact with other people. Other health anxiety provoking diseases (such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, etc.) very often do not have such clear instructions on how to prevent the disease, but rather the only prevention of a fatal outcome is early observation of symptoms. People who began monitoring the pandemic situation on the Internet early on were likely informed about protection options before others and started applying safety behaviours a few weeks before lockdown, which might explain the direct effect of cyberchondria on behaviour. It would be interesting to examine the role of cyberchondria in adopting harmful behaviours that were propagated during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. use of bleach to disinfect surfaces or ingestion of harmful substances such as chlorine dioxide-industrial bleach). It will also be interesting to investigate the role of cyberchondria and COVID-19 anxiety in relaxing safety behaviour, where it might be expected that persons with high levels cyberchondria will continue to engage in safety behaviours longer.",

            "text": "During the second wave, the introduction of lockdown amplified anxiety and safety behaviour in nearly all participants. Again, both anxiety and safety behaviour were higher among those with high levels of cyberchondria. This relationship is higher for COVID-19 anxiety than for safety behaviours, a difference that might be attributed to a decrease in the variance of behaviours in the second wave. Safety behaviour, and avoidance behaviour in particular, has become a social norm. Interestingly, even cyberchondria increased at the second time point. This is an important finding in light of the fact that it is still unclear whether cyberchondria is a behavioural manifestation of health anxiety or whether excessive online searching could encourage the development of excessive health anxiety over time. Previous longitudinal research confirms the hypothesis that excessive searching alone is a risk factor for later onset of mental disorders. A study of healthy participants indicated that, among people low in anxiety, an increase in health-related online searches predicts an increase in anxiety two months later and that an increase in anxiety in this population predicts an increase in online searches. [37] . A second longitudinal study with a general population indicated that increased online searching results in increased depression 12 to 18 month later [38] . Although the present study, in light of its' cross-sectional design, does not allow for causal conclusions, information regarding the growth in cyberchondria is certainly worthy of attention. Arguably, an atmosphere of impending danger might have caused frantic online searching for COVID-19-related information that was perhaps initiated with a wish to gather information and gain a sense of relief (e.g., positive meta-beliefs such as \"I need the Internet research during the pandemic to be better prepared\"). However, such searching more often resulted in the contrary, producing a wealth of (often ambiguous) information and increasing anxiety and distress, which eventually led to cyberchondria [39] . The findings of this study provide unique data on the rate and magnitude of change because it includes two measurement points at the very beginning of the virus outbreak. Data regarding response frequency on individual items of the Short Cyberchondria Scale indicate increased frequencies on items representing the core features of cyberchondria: fear, frustration, and excessive search. This increase may pose a long-term health risk, especially if such behaviour is established and generalized to other diseases and not just for COVID-19.",

We have placed our research focus on cyberchondria specifically in light of the fact that, during virus outbreaks, a situation arises in which media reports are increasingly consumed and lockdown additionally directs people to consume such sources of information [29] . By collecting data at two time points (albeit with two different samples), this research provides an opportunity to observe change at the societal level. The findings indicate that, in the first weeks of the virus outbreak, there was an increase in anxiety and a change in behaviour. Furthermore, results indicate that cyberchondria is associated with anxiety about the COVID-19 disease and contributes to the faster adoption of safety behaviours at the very beginning of the outbreak. However, behaviours that are extremely useful for protection against infectious diseases can be potentially detrimental to mental health [29, 39] . This is an important finding in that is offers guidance to health authorities in relation to public communication measures. Namely, in future similar situations, the general population should be informed about the harmfulness of excessive exposure to information and of searching for information from unreliable sources as something that can be as dangerous to one's health as the virus itself. Another important finding to arise from this study is that, even at the very outset of the pandemic, significantly more people turned to the Internet for information than prior to the pandemic. As such, interventions to alleviate anxiety might also be delivered digitally in order to more effectively reach this vulnerable population and prevent the harmful effects of excessive online searching and (mis) information.",

Similar challenges are faced by researchers in numerous countries and the use of ad-hoc instruments makes comparison of results obtained in different countries difficult. As such, it is important to strive for greater research collaboration and, as much as possible, for the application of the same instruments across international contexts so that emotional and behavioural responses to the pandemic can be understood in a cross-cultural context. Longitudinal research should also be conducted, which will provide numerous answers about the long-term consequences of this period on mental health and health behaviours.",

The findings demonstrated that, over three weeks at the outset of the pandemic, there was a significant increase in anxiety and adoption of safety behaviours. Cyberchondria is associated with both anxiety and safety behaviours even prior to the introduction of official measures for preventing the spread of the virus, which poses a potential risk to mental health but also direction for managing people's responses to safety measures. Namely, because people with high levels of cyberchondria readily follow measures for preventing infection, it is possible that they will similarly follow instructions for preventing the development of problems in mental health. As such, it is important that health authorities provide information about the importance of preserving one's mental health during stressful periods such as virus outbreaks and offer clear instructions for the management of stress and anxiety during such times.",

Now 2nd thing is training, Authors are training their machine to learn to detect & recognize object from given input, so author's machine learning is based on what it see, and it is seeing and learnt from their image dataset. Therefore, with a good amount of quality images authors can improve machine's learning ability. Before discussing implementation, first let's understand what Deep learning is, and what approach we are using for training.",

Second Objective is that in Indian Banking System, they are working with lots of currencies, so we want to use deep learning for currency recognition using images & video input feed.

In this concept, we create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which works same as a Biological Neural Network that is available in human. So, we don't need to do feature extraction in Deep learning, it learns by itself. We have larger amount of Image data. Deep learning can perform better on images rather than Machine learning. Even it provides higher accuracy than machine learning. We can tune different parameters according to our data and model. Just one requirement is that we need a good GPU power for training.

Our training taken almost 8 h, after the getting expected loss we stopped the training. On Tensorboard we observe the measures of loss and iteration continuously. After the training we need to generate a graph file (means model file). From that file machine can see what it is learnt. With code, we generate the inference graph of our training.

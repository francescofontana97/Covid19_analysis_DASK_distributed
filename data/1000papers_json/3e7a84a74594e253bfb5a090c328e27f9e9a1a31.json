            "text": "Vaccines are critical for curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2) . In the USA, two highly protective mRNA vaccines are available: BNT162b2 from Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna (3, 4) . These vaccines induce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) predominantly directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (1) (2) (3) (4) . Serum NAbs are induced at modest levels within ~1 week of the first dose, but their titers are strongly boosted by a second dose at 3 (BNT162b2) or 4 weeks (mRNA-1273) (3, 4) . SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted nasally or orally and infects cells in the mucosae of the respiratory and to some extent also the gastrointestinal tract (5) . Although serum NAbs may be a correlate of protection against COVID-19, mucosal antibodies might directly prevent or limit virus acquisition by the nasal, oral and conjunctival routes (5) . Whether the mRNA vaccines induce mucosal immunity has not been studied. Here, we report that antibodies to the S-protein and its RBD are present in saliva samples from mRNA-vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW). Within 1-2 weeks after their second dose, 37/37 and 8/8 recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively, had S-protein IgG antibodies in their saliva, while IgA was detected in a substantial proportion. These observations may be relevant to vaccine-mediated protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.",

(Pfizer, Group 1, n =40; Moderna, Group 2, n = 9). For comparison, we used two sub-groups of non-vaccinated individuals who were SARS-CoV-2 uninfected (Group 3, n = 8) or who had recovered from infection during or prior to participation in the trial (Group 4, n = 6). Among the Group-4 members, 3 were vaccinated. Further analyses of Group-4 members, and others who may have become infected during the course of the study, are in progress.",

Additional longitudinal profiles are shown as Extended Data (ED Fig. 1 ). The timing of the approximately monthly NYP-WELCOME study visits was not coordinated with the dates on which participants were vaccinated. Hence, samples were not available for some participants in the 3-(Pfizer) and 4-week (Moderna) period between the two vaccine doses. A collated data set for all the vaccinated participants is presented in Fig. 2 , which also includes antibody reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The proportions of vaccinated individuals with saliva and serum IgG, IgM and IgA S-protein antibodies after the first and second doses are summarized in Table 1 (Table 1 ). All the vaccine recipients had serum IgG and IgA antibodies after the second dose, and most also had IgM antibodies. Antibody binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in an ELISA was generally quite similar to what was detected using the S-protein (Fig. 2) . In contrast, antibodies to the S-protein were not detectable in saliva samples from uninfected control individuals (Fig.1C, ED Fig.1C ). Trial participants who became virus-infected before or during the trial did, however, have S-protein IgG antibodies in their saliva, although these infection-elicited responses tended to wane over a multi-month period. IgA antibodies were occasionally detected at lower levels in these saliva samples (Fig. 1D, ED Fig.1D ). The observation of S-protein IgG and IgA in the saliva of SARS-CoV-2 infected people is consistent with previous reports (6, 7) . When two infected individuals (0001, 0052) were vaccinated, their saliva and serum S-protein IgA and IgG reactivities and, in once case also IgM, were rapidly boosted (Fig. 1D) .",

In summary, the saliva assay is the more sensitive of the two, and hence the data plots should not be interpreted as indicating there are quantitatively similar IgA and IgG reactivities in the two fluids. To gain an insight into the relative magnitudes of the saliva and serum responses, we titrated a serum sample from an infected individual (D56) and sera from two participants who had each received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine (Cases 0003 and 0007) in the saliva ELISA format, alongside saliva samples from the same vaccine recipients (Fig. 3) . Judged by the displacements of the titration curves, we estimate that the titers of S-protein IgA and IgG antibodies present in saliva are ~1000-fold and ~10,000 fold lower, respectively, than in serum (Fig. 3) . Note that infection serum D56 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with an ID 50 titer of 900 in our SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus-based neutralization assay (8) . The much lower S-protein antibody reactivities present in saliva are well below what is required to register in that assay.",

            "text": "We show here that the mRNA vaccines induce not just systemic humoral responses that are quantified in serum samples, but also IgG and, to a lesser extent, IgA antibodies to the S-protein and the RBD that are detectable in saliva. The IgA detection antibody we used recognizes both dimeric IgA with and without the secretory component (i.e., SIgA + dIgA). Antibodies in saliva are known to be dominated by SIgA and IgG. Local plasma cells in the stroma of salivary glands secrete dIgA, which traffics through mucosae by interacting with the polymeric Ig receptor. Typically, ~95% of salivary IgA is in the SIgA form. In contrast, IgG in saliva largely originates from plasma, by transudation from the gingival blood circulation (9) (10) (11) . IgM is found at lower levels and is also derived from plasma. In healthy people, the total concentrations in saliva are ~150 \u00b5g/ml for SIgA, ~15 \u00b5g/ml for IgG and ~5 \u00b5g/ml for IgM. In contrast, serum concentrations are much higher, ~1000-fold for IgG and ~100-fold for total IgA (10, 11) . Here, we estimate that the S-protein IgG titers we detected in saliva are ~10,000-fold lower than in sera, while SIgA titers are ~1000-fold lower. Accordingly, any SARS-CoV-2 NAbs present in saliva are below assay detection limits. Could vaccine-or infection-induced salivary, and by extension, nasopharyngeal antibodies prevent or limit SARS-CoV-2 infection at the principal portals of entry -the mouth and nose? Our data do not allow this answer to be determined but they do raise the possibility and suggest that additional studies in this area would be fruitful. A recent report of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques shows that virus can replicate in nasal turbinates when it is suppressed in the lungs by passively transferred NAbs (12) . Assays of vaccineinduced antibodies extracted from NP swabs might provide additional information. However, the Ig concentrations in tissue sites, e.g., intramucosal interstitial fluids, may be impossible to measure by swab-sampling and extraction.",

The aim of the trial is to study the determinants of the diverse COVID-19 outcomes (from infection to resolution or death and before, during and after vaccination) among an exposed population in Manhattan, consisting of NYP-Weill Cornell Medicine asymptomatic healthcare workers who volunteered to participate. The study is designed to prospectively collect sequential specimens and questionnaires twice a month for first 3 months and then monthly for 2 years, during the Covid-19 pandemic. To date (3/9/21), 97 participants have completed 527 study visits. Two participants became SARS-CoV-2-infected during the trial, as determined by a positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test. Six other participants were infected prior to joining the trial, as judged by their positivity for serum S-protein antibodies at multiple time-points. Of the six infected people, three were vaccinated. The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines became available at NYP-WCM after December 15th, 2020, and 78/97 participants have now received at least one dose of either vaccine (Pfizer, n = 63 participants; Moderna, n = 15). Samples derived from the NYP-WELCOME trial are stored in an institutional biorepository that now contains ~11,300 specimens including PBMCs, saliva, stool, urine, plasma, serum and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab extracts. In this study, we used serum and saliva samples only.

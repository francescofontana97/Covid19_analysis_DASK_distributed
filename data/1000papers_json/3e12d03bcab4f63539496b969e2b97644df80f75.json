Researchers around the globe need to design and develop successful therapeutics as well as vaccines against the novel COVID-19 disease. In the present study, we conducted comprehensive computer-assisted analysis on the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in order to design a safe and potent multiepitope vaccine. In silico epitope prioritization shortlisted six HLA I epitopes and six B-cell-derived HLA II epitopes. These high-ranked epitopes were all connected to each other via flexible GPGPG linkers, and at the N-terminus side, the sequence of Cholera Toxin \u03b2 subunit was attached via an EAAAK linker. Structural modeling of the vaccine was performed, and molecular docking analysis strongly suggested a positive association of a multiepitope vaccine with Toll-like Receptor 3. The structural investigations of the vaccine-TLR3 complex revealed the formation of fifteen interchain hydrogen bonds, thus validating its integrity and stability. Moreover, it was found that this interaction was thermodynamically feasible. In conclusion, our data supports the proposition that a multiepitope vaccine will provide protective immunity against COVID-19. However, further in vivo and in vitro experiments are needed to validate the immunogenicity and safety of the candidate vaccine.",

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is composed of RNA which serves as mRNA and contains open reading frames (ORFs) ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, and ORF10; spike glycoproteins; nucleoprotein; membrane protein; and envelope protein E [12] . The spike proteins protrude from the surface of SARS-CoV-2. These spikes come into contact with human cells and are subjected to conformational changes that in turn facilitate the fusion of the membrane of the virus with the human cell membrane [13] . This leads to viral entry inside human cells. SARS-CoV-2 spikes bind to human cell surface angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter human cells [14] . Moreover, the spike protein induces humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 [15] . Therefore, the spike protein is a suitable antigenic target for designing efficient therapeutics against COVID- 19 .",

In this study, we used a computer-assisted vaccine design approach against COVID-19 by combining the approaches used in reverse vaccinology, immunoinformatics, and structural bioinformatics. In silico epitope mapping and prioritization were done on the spike protein of novel coronavirus species to select promising T-cell (CD4+ and CD8+) and B-cell epitopes.

The stability of the protein(s) can be gauged by comparing their dynamic behavior with normal modes [55, 56] . It is an important method that could serve as an alternative to computationally intensive all-atom molecular simulations [57, 58] . By carefully looking at the normal modes associated with internal coordinates, the overall motion of proteins was studied [59] . The approach used is known to yield effective outcomes in less time compared to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations that are in much use [60, 61] . The iMOD server was thus used to study the protein complex-related movements considering important parameters like eigenvalues, B-factors, covariance, and deformability. The deformation of protein chain/s depends on the deformability at the residue level. The eigenvalue associated with each normal mode tells us information about the motion stiffness. This also provides crucial insights into the energy needed to deform the protein(s) structure(s). The easier deformation is clearly indicated by low eigenvalues [62] .",

The half-life of the polyepitope sequence was found to be 30 hours in mammalian reticulocytes (in vitro), more than 20 hours in yeast (in vivo), and more than 10 hours in Escherichia coli (in vivo). An instability index of 28.27 was computed. As the value is less than 40, this projects stability of our vaccine protein. The aliphatic index of 79.08 was calculated for our vaccine, which is a strong indication of thermostability at varying temperatures. Analysis revealed that the grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) is -0.081. Since it is a negative value, this suggests that the vaccine is hydrophilic in nature and has the ability to interact favourably with water molecules which is a desired property. Both ANTIGENPro and VaxiJen projected the antigenic nature of the vaccine construct, with scores of 0.764456 and 0.5098, respectively [28, 43] . The ccSol solubility predictor indicated that there 5 Journal of Immunology Research was a 94% chance of the construct being soluble; another tool, SOLpro, corroborated this by confirming that the vaccine was soluble with a probability of 0.824941 [44, 45] . The allergenicity checks revealed that the protein sequence is not an allergen, so expectation is high that the vaccine will not cause side effects/toxicity inside the human body when administered. BLASTp against the human genome was conducted, and it was found that the sequence does not have any human homologue. Proteins that are homologues of humans may inadvertently cause autoimmunity due to cross-reactivity between the target and host proteins [65] . So, altogether physicochemical analysis of the polyepitopebased construct suggests its suitability for immunological applications.",

As this tool adopts a de novo method (structural templates are not used), it was considered appropriate especially due to the lack of good PDB templates to guide the structure prediction process. The model was then submitted to the Galax-yRefine2 server to undergo both refinements of local regions and overall improvement of the global structure [48] . Out of ten resulting models, one was chosen eventually based on the analysis of ProSA Z-scores (Figure 2(a) ), Ramachandran plot, and ERRAT overall quality score. The selected model (model 1) had collectively more than 95% residues in the favorable and allowed regions and only 3.5% residues in the disallowed regions according to the RAMPAGE server (Figure 2(b) ) [66] . The ProSA Z-score of this model was -4.48 which places it close to experimentally resolved structures of similar sizes, thus confirming near-native quality (Figure 2(c) ). Analysis by the ERRAT server projected a quality score of 81.7204, sug-gesting that very few residues of the designed vaccine lie in erroneous regions [49] . Altogether, our strategy led to the best quality-refined 3D model of the vaccine construct.",

The designed vaccine is colored red while the TLR3 structure is colored dark green. The interacting residues are focused, and some interchain hydrogen bonds are highlighted.

(b) Interacting residues as well as bonding interactions between the vaccine and TLR3 protein chains. 9 Journal of Immunology Research Phase I trials, and 11 vaccines are being subjected to Phase II trials [74] . A total of four vaccine candidates have even passed the Phase I and Phase II trials; thus, researchers will be studying large-scale efficacy in Phase III trials. Simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford Journal of Immunology Research [75] . The Phase III trials of this candidate vaccine are being conducted in Brazil and South Africa. Meanwhile, the Chinese company Sinopharm launched Phase III trials of an inactivated virus vaccine in July in the United Arab Emirates [76] . Another Chinese company, Sinovac Biotech, is conducting a Phase III trial in Brazil of an inactivated vaccine CoronaVac [77] . Interestingly, the protective TB vaccine BCG is also being subjected to a Phase III trial in Australia to assess its protective responses against COVID-19 [78] . Despite the current progress in vaccine development, it will take time to come up with an immunoprotective yet safe COVID-19 vaccine. The spike protein is thought to be a crucial antigenic target for both SARS-CoV-2 and genomically similar SARS-CoV due to its high antigenicity and its functional role in terms of viral attachment and entry into human cells [79, 80] . It was recently reported that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains two IgG immunodominant regions that were recognized by sera obtained from COVID-19 convalescent patients [81] . It was also found that specific targeting of these regions by antibodies led to considerable virus neutralization. Another study reported that recovered patients mounted a considerable CD4+ T cell response against the virus, with nearly 50% of it against the spike protein [15] . Considering the available evidence, it could be argued that the spike protein is a good target for designing and developing a vaccine. Using a variety of computational tools, we selected high-ranked promiscuous epitopes.",

So, we also incorporated the N-terminus molecular adjuvant Cholera Toxin \u03b2 subunit (CTB) which is the nontoxic part of the cholera toxin [39] . CTB is safe for use by humans, tolerated well by immunocompromised persons, and could also activate specific CD4+ T cell responses [83, 84] . Further, the prioritized epitopes were joined together using flexible GPGPG linkers for effective separation while the EAAAK linker joined the CTB adjuvant with the first epitope.",

The HADDOCK protocol is highly adaptive in terms of conducting solvated docking, specifying flexible protein regions, and providing the option of considering modified amino acids. After molecular docking of the designed vaccine with TLR3, refinements were applied on top of the docked complex to further portray the PPIs. As expected, it was observed that the HADDOCK score improved from \u2212158:1 \u00b1 13:2 to \u2212274:4 \u00b1 3:4 after applying molecular refinements. Lower HADDOCK scores, especially negative values, underscore greater interaction potential between the proteins. Analyses of RMSD indicated that highquality structures did not show a lot of structural deviations from near-native states which is a desired outcome. A Gibbs free energy-based assessment of the vaccine-TLR3 complex predicted energetically favorable interaction. The stability of the complex was also confirmed through NMA analysis; hence, a large amount of force is needed to separate the protein chains from each other. Moreover, the vaccine could be easily overexpressed in the E. coli K12 strain as we showed after codon optimization of the candidate vaccine.",

In this study, we carried out a computer-assisted analysis on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to identify highly promising epitopes to guide the development of a safe universal vaccine. These prioritized epitopes were then fused with each other and an adjuvant to form a polyepitope subunit vaccine using computational biology approaches. Three-dimensional structural modeling of the vaccine was carried out and subjected to docking studies with Toll-like Receptor 3 to assess its immunological effectiveness. Our results indicated a strong interaction between our vaccine and the innate receptor, strengthening the proposition that it will lead to the induction of TLR-mediated downstream immune pathways. The present study is entirely in silico work and should be validated by future studies before conducting trials in humans.",

In addition, the biggest gain of this study is the discovery of a U-shaped relationship between bNC and death. Within the range of 1.6-4.0\u00d710 9 /L, patients have a relatively low risk of death. This helps physicians to early assess the risk of poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 infection.",

It means that pre-hospital interventions (administration of antibiotics) can interfere with the accuracy of neutrophil counts. However, the effect of antibiotics on neutrophils is to reduce their concentration in peripheral blood, and our finding shows that the relationship between high neutrophils and COVID-19-associated death is positively correlated, that is, high neutrophils can increase the risk of death. Therefore, the effect of antibiotics on neutrophils is opposite to our results, but will make our results more strong. Secondly, giving patients antipyretics before admission can cause misclassification of fever. However, the results of the multiple cox regression model indicated that fever can increase the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the bia direction of antipyretic was biased towards the reduction of mortality, which would lead to the result biased towards null. In addition, for patients with COVID-19 infection, there is no evidence on the effect of antipyretics on neutrophil counts. Thus, even if patients were misclassified as having fever due to oral antipyretics, the impact of this misclassification on the association of bNC with COVID-19-related mortaliy is unknown. Lastly, changes in the patient's condition will cause neutrophils to change over time, and this time-dependent variability will affect the results.",

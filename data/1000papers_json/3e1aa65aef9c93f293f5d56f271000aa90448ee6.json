In the case of benzodiazepine withdrawal this can not only lead to significant discomfort, frustration, and trauma for patients, but can lead to serious medical problems. This commentary uses the authors' recent first-person experience with a disbelieving doctor in order to illustrate the lack of value often given to the claims and narratives of people with lived substance use experience. I outline some of the potential problems with this approach, including the effects on patients themselves and the loss of an important source of evidence-based knowledge. It also discusses potential risks associated with the recent increase in benzodiazepine prescription due to Covid-19 and offers suggestions for improving treatment outcomes.",

However, I was unable to do so at first because my prescribing doctorwho also happens to be my methadone maintenance providerdid not believe that it was withdrawal that I was experiencing. Despite my insistence that I had been in withdrawal many times and knew what it felt like (as well as the fact that it began when I stopped taking Xanax), after consulting with a colleague he told me that I had not been taking them for long enough or in high enough doses to cause withdrawal. Rather, he was -pretty sure that it's either food poisoning or Covid-19\u2016.",

            "text": "Thus, while this event was a highly traumatic and un-necessary experience for me, it also demonstrates how little value medical professionals often place on voices and lived experience of people who use drugs (PWUD). Although research shows that this approach can lead to a lack of trust of medical providers, reduced willingness to utilize medical services, and negative healthcare outcomes, it remains all too common within medical settings (Meyerson et al., 2021; Nyblade, 2009; Ahern et al., 2007; Ford et al., 2004) . Moreover, since several studies have shown a marked increase in anxiety, insomnia, and stress since the advent of Covid-19 and co-occurring political instability, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and other dependence/withdrawal producing drugs may be prescribed at increasing rates, oftentimes to individuals with little or no experience in their characteristics or proper use (Honig, 2021; Chiappini et al., 2020; Agrawal, 2020 ). An early analysis shows that between February 16, 2020 and March 15, 2020, the number of prescriptions filled per week for antidepressant, anti-anxiety and anti-insomnia medications increased by 21% (Express Scripts, 2020). Thus, upon future discontinuation of these substances, many people are likely to find themselves in the throes of withdrawala truly horrifying, disorienting, and potentially dangerous experiencewithout any frame of reference to understand what's happening to them, and potentially receiving misinformation from the one source they are told to rely upon.",

In this case, medical practitioners today learn about substance use primarily through biological and genetically-focused theories that position problematic substance use as a disease and PWUD as -addicts\u2016, innately prone to lying and other misbehavior (Vrecko, 2010; Volkow & Li, 2005) . Although research on the etiology of problematic substance use is highly contested and scholars have pointed out that addiction-as-disease narratives pathologize substance use and serve an ideological foundation for policies that criminalize PWUD (Vrecko, 2010; Reinarman, 2005) , because of their institutional dominance, physicians are unlikely to learn anything outside of that perspective (Lewis, 2018; Frank, 2018; Fraser, Moore, & Keane, 2014; Reinarman, 2005) . As a result, it becomes baked into the ways that medical practitioners conceptualize drug use and relate to people who use them, ultimately justifying the kind of paternalistic attitude physicians all-too-often adopt towards their patients who use drugs.",

Although RCTswhich are seen to eliminate bias through randomized assignment of study participants to separate groups who are then exposed to different circumstances and observedare often touted as the pinnacle of evidence-based data collection, their use of pre-determined conceptual categories, situated within a particular worldview, creates its own form of bias. As Deaton & Cartwright argued in a 2018 critique of RCTs, such methods were -not blinded nor sufficiently controlled for other sources of bias, and indeed many cannot be\u2016 (2018).",

First of all, such measures do not account for the differences between withdrawal from different substances. Moreover, they also rely on characterizing withdrawal as a combination of symptoms, and thus, completely miss the larger affective experience. In particular, they fail to capture the feeling of one's Central Nervous System having lost the ability to regulate how we experience the world, its capacity to make our existence feel more-or-less comfortable (Kosten & Baxter, 2019) . As a result, such metrics and comparisons consistently mischaracterize and underestimate withdrawal's capacity for producing dysphoria and pain (Kopelson, 2020; Fixsen & Ridge, 2017; Fixsen, 2016) . Yes, withdrawal includes nausea and vomiting; sweating; gooseflesh; and the need to constantly \u2017kick' out your legs, but the real horror is feeling as though you cannot bear simply being for another second, every second. This \u2017feeling' is the result of complex biological, pharmacological, psychological, and social forces that are very hard to convey and resist quantification (Kopelson, 2020; Fixsen & Ridge, 2017) . As one former benzodiazepine patient described -[Withdrawal was] hell and torture for every hour of every day for three years. I became so desperately ill that I find it very difficult to described what happened\u2026. I could hardly walk; I couldn't have a shower because I couldn't stand for long enough. I could not tolerate sound or light. My entire body was affected from the top of my head to the tip of my toes. All these sensations were intolerable. I just wanted to die.\u2016 (Brocklehurst, 2017) .",

Rather, I argue that even within that context, doctors should place greater credence on the claims of those with lived experience. For example, Shared Decision Making (SDM) models, where clinicians and patients share the best available evidence and approach decisions collaboratively have demonstrated an ability to empower patients and improve their experiences with medical providers (Elwyn et al. 2012; Makoul & Clayman, 2006) .

Yet, like all treatment providers, he is also part of a system that conceptualizes the claims and narratives of patients who use drugs through a particular lens that is not always conducive to positive healthcare outcomes.",

However, in the short-term, doctors could avoid a number of problems by simply listening to and believing their patients more often. Additionally, doctors who deal routinely with PWUD should have access to a number of active (or at least former) substance users whom they can call upon for advice. The substance use forums discussed above should also be consulted regularly by any physicians who prescribe dependence-producing drugs. This, in addition to greater focus on alternative treatment models, like SDM, would go a long way towards improving medical outcomes for marginalized populations as well as helping to foster a relationship of trust and respect where better diagnosis and treatment plans can be made.",

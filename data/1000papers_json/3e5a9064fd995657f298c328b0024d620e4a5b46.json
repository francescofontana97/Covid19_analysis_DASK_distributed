Increased levels of anxiety may be related to factors such as fears of the infection, social isolation linked to lockdown or because of the economic and occupational impact of the pandemic. Women who are vulnerable either due to personality factors, a family history or those in the perinatal period may be at risk for psychotic symptoms precipitated by high levels of COVID related anxiety (Wu et al., 2020) .",

Criticism by relatives about having a female baby and her inadequacy as a mother made her feel worse. Sertraline 50 mg/d was added by her psychiatrist and olanzapine was stopped. However, her condition worsened and she presented to our Mother Baby Unit (MBU), with agitation, crying spells, excessive anxiety, persecutory delusions and overvalued ideas that she had contracted COVID 19 infection and was spreading it to her infant. This resulted in her refusing to breastfeed for fear of spreading the infection to the infant. At presentation, she also had catatonic symptoms of mutism and staring.

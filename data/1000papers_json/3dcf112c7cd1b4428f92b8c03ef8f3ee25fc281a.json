While clinical and scientific research has improved, 7 better research and development are needed, owing to the different characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic. While diversified approaches to research were used to analyze the phenomenon of the pandemic, only a few investigations were conducted to assess the effect of these measures in the perception of nursing students and interns, particularly in their willingness to treat patients infected with COVID-19.",

In particular, considering the long-lasting shortage of national nurses in Saudi Arabia, in addition to the forecasted mobility limitation and turnover of the current nursing workforce, which is mostly (63%) comprised of expatriates, 9 it is essential to consider unconventional strategies aiming at expanding the national nursing workforce in order to embrace the impact of COVID-19. Thus, trying to utilize nursing interns and senior nursing students, if appropriately deployed and supported, could be the quickest way to meet the growing demands of the Saudi's healthcare delivery system and to maximize the nation's ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. As previously reported by Chilton et al, 10 in the time of a pandemic, it is essential to investigate the willingness of nursing interns and senior nursing students to respond and treat patients infected with COVID- 19 .",

For example, Martin 11 pointed out that nurses' willingness to treat was correlated with concerns of safety, including safety for their families and the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE). Other potential predictors of nurses' intentions to work during a pandemic like the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in the US were to provision of adequate PPE for nurses and to safeguard both nurses' health and their families. 12 During the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) pandemic, Chilton et al 10 reported that there was a lack of supporting literature related to the willingness and perceptions of duty of nursing students to treat EVD patients. The study suggested that nursing students were willing to treat EVD patients; however they were greatly concerned by their lack of knowledge and personal safety. 10 A recent study in Saudi Arabia highlighted high concerns of healthcare workers about COVID-19 who felt at risk of acquiring COVID-19, threatened if a colleague was infected with COVID-19, obliged to treat COVID-19 patients, and not safe when using the standard precautions at work. 8 In another study among final-year medical students, only 34.3% of the respondents was totally willing to work as part of the healthcare workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. 13 However, little is known about the nursing interns and students' willingness to treat patients infected with COVID-19. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate nursing interns and students' willingness to treat patients with COVID-19 and its predictor. Additionally, the study explored about the feelings, knowledge, and concerns of nursing interns and students in treating patients with COVID-19.",

Out of 70, 43 participants were concerned about transmitting the disease to their families where there are little children or elderly family members with underlying chronic diseases. Other concerns mostly cited were regarding their lack of knowledge and information about the disease, not ready to care due to lack of experience and training in treating patients with COVID-19, and having fear or being scared of getting infected with the disease. Additionally, there were issues raised regarding if hospitals will provide enough personal protective equipment (PPE), including the use of N95 masks, exclusive housing for them to stay and not to go home with their families, safe transportation provided by the hospital, and, lastly, whether hospitals will allow students or interns to help during this pandemic. The respondents stated, \"I am scared to get infected and infect my family when I go home\", \"I think I don't have enough information, practice or training to protect myself and care for COVID-19 patients\", \"If I am a licensed nurse, of course, I am willing to work because it is part of my job but I think I have problems with housing and transportation\", and \"I think the hospital will not allow students to help in this situation\".",

The results revealed that nursing students and interns differ with their willingness to treat patients infected with the deadly disease. In this study, the overall mean score of the willingness to treat of participants was 20.19, with an average mean of 2.89. The result suggests that participants indicated neutral or having undecided willingness to treat patients with COVID-19. The reason for this could be due to their various concerns and related issues raised regarding treating patients with COVID-19. The overall mean score of the willingness to treat of participants in this study is higher compared to the study conducted among nursing students (16.42) when surveyed with their willingness to treat EVD patients in the US. 10 The study conducted by Chilton et al 10 was mostly participated by married students while this study was mostly participated by nursing students and interns who were single. Likewise, the knowledge about COVID-19 by the participants in this study was lower compared to the knowledge about EVD reported in another study. 10 15 and 93.2% of healthcare workers had good knowledge. 16 In a recent study in China, 89.51% of psychiatric physicians of the hospitals studied had extensive knowledge of COVID-19, where 64.63% of them received the relevant training in hospitals. 17 The percentage of nursing students and interns who were likely and very likely willing to care and attend clinical placements knowing there were suspected and infected patients with COVID-19, was 41.01% and 46.07%, respectively. This result of this study is comparable to the findings of a systematic review conducted by Aoyagi et al, 18 where the percentage of healthcare workers who expressed a willingness to work during an influenza (H1N1) pandemic ranged from 23.1% 19 to 95.8%. 20 It is worth noting to give attention to this result because the percentage of those who are likely and very likely willing to care for patients with COVID-19 is low at the borderline compared to the previous review. 18 Additionally, the result is lower compared to a previous study where 44% of nurses expressed that they would still report to work as usual during an avian influenza pandemic. 21 Likewise, about 77.17% of physicians in psychiatric hospitals expressed a willingness to care for patients infected with COVID-19. 17 Nonetheless, the majority of the participants expressed that they were more likely to care for patients with COVID-19 if they had more information about the disease. Furthermore, this result is evident because the majority of participants reported a good level of knowledge about COVID-19 where at the time of the study, information about the deadly disease was increasingly disseminated on a national level and globally. Likewise, the finding is similar with a previous study in the US where the students claimed to have higher willingness to treat scores when their knowledge scores were higher during the EVD outbreak. 10 Moreover, the participants reported that if they were licensed staff nurses, they were unlikely to refuse attending work when required to care for patients with COVID-19. Likewise, the participants claimed that if they were licensed staff nurses, they would be unlikely to refuse to care for patients with COVID-19. The result is consistent with a previous study among physicians where they have consented to accept a standard level of risk of having infection when entering the medical profession since the outbreak of HIV/AIDS; however, factors other than fear of contagion contribute to the reluctance to treat patients. 22 Similar to another finding of this study, the nursing students and interns' neutral or having undecided willingness ",

Additionally, about 74% of medical students in another study in Israel felt that by choosing to enter medical school they were morally obligated to treat patients despite the risk of infection. 23 More so, there are many grounds that healthcare workers have an obligation to treat patients during an outbreak or pandemic including implied consent and expressed consent, having special training, reciprocity, and professional oaths and codes. 24 In particular, nurses always have obligations to care for the patients in front of them during the pandemic amidst many limitations posed by COVID-19, making use of what resources are available, offering knowledge and skills to relieve patients' symptoms, providing options for palliative care or spiritual support, or simply listening to patients' concerns and fears. 25 However, in another survey, many nurses and other healthcare workers reported that they would opt to stay home during an avian influenza pandemic even if they lost their jobs. 21 On the contrary, a previous study revealed that most nurses would be able and willing to go to work during the H1N1 pandemic. 11 Likewise, in a separate study, about 90% of nurses out of the 735 participants indicated that they were willing to work during a flu pandemic (Martin et al, 2013) . In South Africa, the results of a previous study about EVD showed that 44.8% of nursing students expressed willingness to care patients infected with the disease. 26 The comparison on the willingness of nursing students and interns to treating patients with COVID-19 revealed that nursing students and interns differ on self-assessed willingness to treat patients with COVID-19. The participants shared different views where nursing students were more likely to attend clinical placement and to care for patients with COVID-19 if they had more information about the disease than their nursing intern counterparts. However, if they were licensed nurses, nursing interns were more unlikely than nursing students to refuse to care for patients with COVID-19 whether required or not required. The results are inconsistent with a previous study where there were no substantive differences found between the students of the two universities about their willingness to treat during an EVD pandemic. 10 The inconsistency of results could be due to the educational background of the participants of the two studies where the previous report had licensed students who were studying graduate and post-graduate courses. Additionally, the severity and mode of transmission of the two infectious diseases, EVD and COVID-19, could be the other reasons of the inconsistent results between the two studies.",

Moreover, participants raised many issues such as if hospitals will provide sufficient PPE including N95 masks, housing, and transportation, and, lastly, if hospitals will allow students to help during this pandemic. The results are true with the case with COVID-19 which poses significantly more risk to families with elderly members. 31 Similarly, a previous study reported that the ability of nurses and their willingness to work decreased primarily when there are existing transportation problems. 11 Likewise, the concerns of participants in this study are consistent with another study where nursing students mostly cited the many concerns including transmitting the EVD disease to self, family, or friends; lack of hospital equipment (eg, PPE) and education; and lack of knowledge about the EVD virus. 10 With regards to the EVD pandemic, the results of a recent study in South Africa revealed that the willingness to care for EVD patients was higher when family concerns did not matter. In the same study, encouraging hospital settings was reported to increase a willingness to treat for EVD patients; however, the willingness to care was less when a perceived fear of infection was high. 25 However, McConnell 30 disputed that it is morally permissible for healthcare workers to refuse to work when their duty to treat is outweighed by the combined risks and burdens of treating patients with COVID-19, especially for those who are living with their families. Thus, the results of the current study might imply that the consistency of the issues and concerns of the nursing students and interns with previous research findings could affect their willingness to care for patients infected with COVID-19. However, the readers must be cautious in understanding the implication of the findings as this was not proven to be statistically significant nor objectively verified through a qualitative approach.",

First, the study utilized a developed instrument from a previous study with only having face validity, 10 as the only available tool conducted among nursing students. Future studies are recommended to include construct validity and reliability of the tool such as exploratory factor analysis. Second, the study sample was from one institution which possibly limited the generalization of findings to other nursing institutions in the kingdom. However, it can be justified that the participants seriously considered their actual perceptions of their feelings, knowledge, and willingness to treat due to the current impact of COVID-19 in their lives. Third, the study used a self-reported questionnaire, which has the tendency of misrepresenting the actual feelings, knowledge, and willingness to treat of the participants, especially during the actual outbreak of COVID-19 globally. Therefore, more research is needed to confirm the findings of this study, including among nursing staff across the hospitals in the country.",

Moreover, having good knowledge of the participants about COVID-19 did not mean that they were likely to care for patients with COVID-19. The reported good level of knowledge about COVID-19 of the participants was suboptimal compared to previous research studies during an outbreak or pandemic of infectious diseases. Moreover, the different views, and many important concerns and issues raised by the participants related to their willingness to treat patients infected with COVID-19 must be considered.",

There is a clear need for educational and training programs both in clinical practice and academia for the improvement among nursing students and interns who reported a paucity of knowledge about COVID-19. This should, in turn, improve the willingness to treat for patients with COVID-19 among nursing students and interns as well as to protect themselves and their families. Furthermore, hospital institutions should provide additional incentives or hazard protections to maintain and even increase the number of staff at the frontlines who are willing to care for patients amid the deadly pandemic of COVID-19.

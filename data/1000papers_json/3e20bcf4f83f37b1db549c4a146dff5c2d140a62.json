Figure 1 displays examples of the two most common toolpath strategies currently used. The discrete step down method shown in Figure 1 b) is a simple strategy which can typically be produced in traditional CAM software. In general, the most widely used toolpath strategy currently used is the helical step down, shown in Figure 1 c) . This type of toolpath constantly feeds in the vertical direction throughout its horizontal movements and can create challenges for programming. Several publications outline how this type of path can be effectively achieved [12] [13] [14] . A specific case in which a discrete step down path is desired over a helical path is when forming soft polymers into cone-shaped geometries. When utilizing a helical step down path, the material tends to wrinkle. The discrete step down approach can be used to avoid this by alternating directions traveled around the workpiece with each step down. While the majority of research conducted on SPIF utilizes these traditional toolpathing strategies, several novel approaches have been investigated. The multi-stage forming strategy has been shown to significantly improve formability. This method forms the final geometry in multiple stages at increas-ing wall angles. Figure 2 shows how this can be achieved. In this figure, profile a) would be formed first, followed by b), c), and d) in sequence. This type of toolpath has been previously explored in several works [15] [16] [17] . While this may be considered a novel toolpathing strategy, the underlying approach to the toolpath is either a helical or discrete step down path. Another novel toolpath strategy which slightly deviates from the traditional strategies is the wavy toolpath [18] . This toolpath travels in waves centered around a path which follows the standard helical toolpath. The objective of this path is to emulate vibration assisted incremental forming and achieve a unique surface finish with improved surface variability. A disadvantage experienced with this type of path was an unintentional reduction in feedrate. In this experimental testing, a lower-grade milling center was used during forming. This mill was unable to efficiently handle the high resolution of G-code needed to produce these waves, causing the mill to move at a slower rate than was desired.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 662, "end": 666, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 667, "end": 671, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 672, "end": 676, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1549, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1554, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1559, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1822, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 105, "end": 113, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 230, "end": 241, "text": "Figure 1 b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 425, "end": 436, "text": "Figure 1 c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1346, "end": 1354, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A novel toolpath is proposed and tested herein which deviates from the conventional toolpaths previously discussed, with the primary objective to achieve a more uniform thickness profile.

With traditional toolpaths, portions of geometries with flats in the center regions of the workpiece remain untouched by the forming tool, causing variation in resultant thickness and stress.

The geometry formed by the radial toolpath was not, however, a funnel shape. This geometry contained straight walls, rather than the curved walls featured in funnel shaped geometries. Because a funnel shape could not be formed by the radial toolpath, a different approach was used to perform baseline tests. Traditional helical toolpaths were used to form the same geometry that was created at failure during radial toolpath testing. If the geometry could be successfully formed using traditional toolpaths, the depth and wall angle of the geometry were increased until failure was reached.

The most sensitive parameter over the range tested herein was the inside diameter value. A drastic difference can be seen for tests with curvature values of 100. Subsequent to testing using a curve value of 100, a lower curve value of 75 was tested to determine if a smaller radiused curve would have a positive influence on formability.

While some machines are able to effectively smooth out the transition between these points, other sequential machines calculate moves at each point, stopping at each point on extremely short paths to wait for calculations to complete; this creates significant losses in efficiency, feed rate and smoothness. In the case of the cylinder geometry, the radial toolpath was able to alleviate this loss in efficiency because the majority of motions occur linearly and over long distances.

It is hypothesized that the hole creation can be eliminated by adapting a radial toolpath which travels to the center of the workpiece and stops, rather than enabling the tool motion to travel past the center. However, in applications where the center regions of a part may be removed, this behavior is not a limitation. Additionally, the location of failure must be considered. Traditional SPIF toolpaths will cause failure to occur in the formed surfaces of the part which require the greatest accuracy and surface finish.

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Abstract Most reports of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) have come from Europe and North America. The paucity of reports in Africa is in contrast with the demographics of the series in New York, Paris and UK with children of African ancestry accounting for over 40%, of all cases of MIS-C. With the global trend of higher prevalence of MIS-C in children of African ancestry, enhanced surveillance and awareness for this syndrome in children with COVID-19 in Africa are therefore important. A case report of a 12-year old Nigerian girl with MIS-C is presented in line with the WHO global surveillance especially in areas were MIS-C",

            "text": "Wu, MacGoogan, 2020) Children were also reported to have a lower risk for severe COVID-19 disease requiring critical care in North America. (Shekerdemia, et al, 2020) As the pandemic progressed, reports from European and North American countries highlighted the occurrence of a hyper, multisystem inflammatory process in children that had features like Kawasaki disease (KD). (WHO, 2020) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Verdoni et al, 2020 in Italy, reported a 30-fold increase in the incidence of Kawasaki-like disease with evidence of immune response to SARS COV-2 over 30 days; while Toubiana et al, 2020 from Paris also reported a KD like syndrome in a cohort of children with COVID-19. Dufort et al, 2020 in New York also reported 95 confirmed cases with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The KD like syndrome associated with COVID-19 in children has been described as atypical KD and a possible distinct clinical entity. (Kam, et al, 2020) These distinctions in the clinical manifestations have thus prompted the development of case definitions and diagnostic criteria by the World Health Organisation (WHO), Center for disease control (CDC) and the Royal College of Paediatric and Child Health (RCPCH). (Simpson and Newburger, 2020) MIS-C has also been selected as an urgent reportable condition by the WHO emphasizing the importance of surveillance especially in places where it is considered a rarity. Most reports of MIS-C associated with COVID-19 have come from Europe and North America (WHO, 2020, Son, 2020). The paucity of reports in Africa is in contrast with the demographics of the series in New York (Dufort et al, 2020), Paris (Toubiana et al, 2020) and UK (Riphagen, et al, 2020), (Whittaker et al, 2020), which reported that children of African ancestry accounted for 40%, 57%, 75%, and 38%, respectively of all cases of MIS-C. The only report from Africa is from South Africa, with patients of African and black ethnicity consisting of 78.3%. (Webb et al, 2020) It has been previously observed, that very few cases of KD have been reported from Nigeria, with four separate reports documenting only 10 cases since 2010. (Animasahun et al, 2017) With the global trend of higher prevalence of MIS-C in children of African ancestry, enhanced surveillance and awareness for this syndrome in children with COVID-19 in Africa are therefore important. This first report of a case of MIS-C in a Nigerian female child is expected to promote awareness of this syndrome and improve the care of children with severe COVID-19 disease in Nigeria and Africa.",

The diagnosis of MIS-C in this case; which was centred on the clinical presentation and basic laboratory evaluation, also demonstrates the utility of the WHO preliminary case definition criteria, as a tool which applies to all settings irrespective of resource capacity. The diagnostic of MIS-C, in this case, is further strengthened by the observation that the clinical features conform to diagnostic criteria under the WHO, RCPCH and CDC case definitions. (Simpson et al 2020, WHO 2020, Whittaker et al, 2020) These features include; Age of 0-19years with fever > 3 days, rash or bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis or mucocutaneous inflammation signs (oral, hands or feet); Acute gastrointestinal problems (diarrhoea, vomiting, or abdominal pain); features of involvement of more than 2 organ systems, elevated markers of inflammation such as ESR and evidence of COVID-19 with positive RT-PCR test and the improbability of bacterial sepsis, the rarity of rickettsia diseases in Nigeria, and the absence of toxic shock features.This case also brings to the fore the challenges of diagnosis in settings of low resource where access to investigations like BNP, ferritin, procalcitonin and daily echocardiography are limited. It is however observed that all the criteria and the WHO criteria, in particular, can easily be applied for diagnosis of MIS-C in low resource settings if all the options in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f criterion are followed. The non-performance and non-reporting of echocardiography is an acknowledged limitation of this report; as it limited the ability to evaluate the presence of cardiac involvement or abnormalities in this case. This observation has also been seen other series of MIS-C were echocardiography was not reported and in some instances found to be normal as shown in a systematic review.(Ahmed et al, 2020)    The differentiation between MIS-C and other paediatric inflammatory syndromes such as KD and TSS may be challenging, however, there is evidence that these entities are distinct despite similarities in the presentation.(Jiang et al, 2020, WHO, 2020) The older age of onset, being of African or Hispanic descent and the presence of more intense inflammation, has been documented as a key distinguishing feature between MIS-C and other inflammatory syndromes (KD and TSS). The results of reviews and case series, (Jiang et al, 2020), (Ahmed et al, 2020), (Whittaker et al, 2020) indicate that presentation at an age above 7 years is more characteristic of MIS-C compared to KD and TSS which is consistent with the age of 12 years for the index case. Besides, MIS-C is more prevalent in children of African ancestry and found to run a less severe clinical course, with average ICU admission duration of 6 days as observed by Godfred-Cato, et al 2020 in a USA Series. The exclusion of other causes is also a key criterion for the diagnosis of MIS-C. In this index case, there was prior treatment for suspected bacterial sepsis before referral with poor response, in contrast to the response to anti-inflammatory treatment. Also, the features of shock were not prominent despite the evidence of extensive multisystem inflammation (Jiang et al, 2020), (Whittaker et al, 2020). The differentiation between MIS-C and Severe COVID-19 is also important. This case was more likely a case of MIS-C rather than severe COVID-19. This assertion is based on key distinguishing features highlighted by Ahmed et al 2020 in a review of 39 studies. These features are fever over 5 days, presence of diarrhoea and rashes which are more in keeping with MIS-C than severe COVID-19 found in this index case. Also, the presence of more severe J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f leucocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, higher creatinine, and ESR are more in line with MIS-C than severe COVID-19 as shown by Ahmed et al, 2020. Intravenous steroids with other adjunctive therapy were applied in our patient, as part of our severe COVID-19 treatment protocol, with a favourable outcome and rapid resolution of symptoms. The favourable outcome and ICU stay of 6 days, in this case, is similar to the outcome of other reported series by Riphagen et al, 2020 in the UK, Verdoni et al, 2020 in Italy and Toubiana et al, 2020 in France. Despite the non-use of intravenous immune globulins (IVIG) for our patient, response to treatment was still good. The use of steroids as a treatment option in low resource setting has also been observed by Ahmed at al, 2020), The outcome of this case also justifies the role of steroids in the management of these cases either alone or in combination with IVIG as implemented by Riphagen et al, 2020 for cases in the UK. The diagnosis of MIS-C in this Nigerian child, therefore, reinforces the need for physicians and health care systems in Africa to be more vigilant in the assessment of children with severe COVID-19 disease. The observations of higher prevalence of MIS-C in children of African ancestry in Europe and North America may suggest a racial and genetic susceptibility which puts African children at higher risk. The issues of ethnic disparities associated with COVID-19 have emerged since the onset of the pandemic with some observations suggesting the people of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are at an increased risk of acquiring infection and adverse outcomes. (Pan, et al 2020). The reports of MIS-C series around the world have observed a higher prevalence in black and Asian populations. The paucity of reports in Sub Saharan Africa is in contrast with the demographics from New York, USA with 40% of MIS-C patients being of African Ancestry (Dufort et al, 2020) while Godhead-Cato et al, 2020 reported that 40.5% of their patients were (Hispanic) and 33.1% were black. Other studies from the European J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f continent in Paris(Toubiana et al, 2020) and UK(Riphagen, et al, 2020),(Whittaker et al, 2020), reported that children of African ancestry accounted for 57%, 75%, and 38% respectively of all cases of MIS-C. This pattern of ethnic predilection is also observed on the African continent with a study from South Africa, showing that patients of African and black ethnicity made up 78.3% of MIS-C patients(Webb et al, 2020). It is thought that the higher prevalence of MIS-C among children of African ancestry is linked to a genetic locus that increases the risk of more severe disease in some ethnic groups.(Jiang et al, 2020)    It is therefore anticipated that with the increased risk of MIS-C in African children, there may be more cases MIS-C, especially in SSA with increased surveillance for MIS-C in Africa.However, it may turn out that the incidence of MIS-C may be lower in African compared to non-African communities with a similar rate of infection in children, indicating that factors other than race play a role in the increased percentage of children of African ancestry among children with MIS-C.In conclusion, we report a rare case of MIS-C in Nigerian child with COVID-19 and recommend vigilance among physicians and expanded effort at surveillance to promote early recognition and diagnosis of MIS-C in Africa. All the current case definitions of MIS-C by the CDC, RCPCH and WHO are easy to use with the WHO preliminary case definition particularly promoting the recognition of MIS-C in areas of resource limitation. It is expected that increase surveillance will provide required evidence for the understanding of the geographic and racial factors which influence the prevalence of MIS-C and KD. The experience from the case will create awareness, expand knowledge, and support clinicians on the African continent in the approach to other potential cases.Sources of funding: NoneConflict of Interest: None",

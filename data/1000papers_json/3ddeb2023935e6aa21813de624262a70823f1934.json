This interaction with zinc and its stabilization might result in decreased catalytic activity of NEP, as it is a zinc dependent endopeptidase.NEP degrades various peptide substrates at the amino sides of hydrophobic amino acids.According to the reports, the protein structure of NEP consists of a large hydrophobic pocket,containing the side chains ALA543, ILE558, PHE563, MET579, VAL580, HIS583, VAL692 and, TRP693 [39].

Many patients have legitimate questions regarding the safety, efficacy and acceptability of these vaccines [5] , and often consult their general practitioner (GP) to have these concerns addressed. This is driven by GPs being regarded as accessible sources of trusted vaccine information [8] , and their visibility at the forefront of vaccine delivery [6] .",

Patients with diabetes and uncontrolled blood glucose levels are at increased risk for poor clinical outcomes and in-hospital mortality related to COVID-19. Therefore, achieving good glycaemic control is of paramount importance among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Basal-bolus insulin therapy is a safe and effective intervention for the management of hyperglycaemia in hospitalised patients. The aim of this article is to provide a practical guidance for the use of the basal-bolus insulin regimen in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus. Methods: This guidance document was formulated based on the review of available literature and the combined personal experiences of the authors. We provide a comprehensive review on the use of the basal-bolus insulin regimen, including its principles, rationale, indications, prerequisites, initiation, and dose titration, and also suggest targets for blood glucose control and different levels of capillary blood glucose monitoring. Various case scenarios are used to illustrate how optimal glucose control can be achieved, such as through adjustments in doses of prandial and basal insulin, the use of correctional insulin dosing and changes in the timing and content of major and minor meals. Conclusion: The practical guidance for the use of the basal-bolus insulin regimen in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus presented here can be used for patients admitted to hospital for indications other than COVID-19 and for those in ambulatory care.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected 213 countries worldwide, with more than 5.4 million confirmed cases and more than 340,000 deaths at the time of writing this paper [1] . The outbreak of this disease has resulted in an unparalleled increase in admissions to dedicated COVID-19 facilities, with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease reported to be major comorbidities among patients with COVID-19 [2] . The pooled prevalence of diabetes in a meta-analysis of nine observational studies of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 was reported to be 9% (95% confidence interval 6-12%) [3] . A high insulin requirement has been reported for the management of hyperglycaemia in patients with COVID-19, especially in those with severe disease, which has been attributed to a combination of severe insulin resistance and decreased insulin secretion due to beta-cell dysfunction [4] . Among patients with COVID-19, diabetes is associated with an increased severity of infection, rapid disease progression, poor clinical outcomes and mortality [5] , but this association is mainly driven by the severity of hyperglycaemia. In a retrospective study of [ 7000 patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the in-hospital mortality rate was tenfold lower (1.1 vs. 11%) in patients with well-controlled blood glucose levels (upper limit B 10 mmol/L or 180 mg/dl) than in those with poor blood glucose control (upper limit [ 10 mmol/L or 180 mg/dl) during the course of hospitalisation [6] .

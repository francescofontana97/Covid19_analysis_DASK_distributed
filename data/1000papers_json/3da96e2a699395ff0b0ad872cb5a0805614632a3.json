Recommended preventative measures are available but compliance varies (Table 1) . 1 A quadrivalent (ACYW) meningococcal vaccine administered \u226510 days before travel is a compulsory visa requirement for all travellers. A conjugate or a polysaccharide vaccine is acceptable but the former provides protection for 5 years compared with 3 years for polysaccharide vaccines. 2 Currently, three brands of conjugated vaccines (Nimenrix \u00ae , Menveo \u00ae and Menactra \u00ae ), but no polysaccharide vaccine, are available in Australia. In 2018, Nimenrix \u00ae replaced the Hib-MenC vaccine at 12 months of age on the national immunisation program (NIP) and hence funded for eligible individuals. There may be some brand-specific immune interference with other vaccines: for example, Menactra \u00ae should not be coadministered with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, but be given at least 4 weeks later, and administering tetanus, low-dose diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine 3-4 weeks after (not before) Nimenrix \u00ae has the advantage of an enhanced tetanus immunity. 3 Influenza vaccine is strongly recommended for Hajj pilgrims and the uptake among Australian pilgrims has improved in recent years to about 80%. 1 Currently, quadrivalent influenza vaccines (including both lineages of influenza B) are available in Australia for individuals aged <65 years, two higher-immunogenicity trivalent influenza vaccines (one 'high-dose' vaccine and another adjuvant) are funded under the NIP for adults aged \u226565 years.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 165, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 451, "end": 452, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1135, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1281, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 161, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "It is also advised that pilgrims remain up-to-date with other routine vaccines, including measles, pertussis and hepatitis B-containing vaccines.

There is considerable risk of pertussis among Hajj pilgrims. 4 In Australia, Tdap vaccines are available free at age 10-15 years and for pregnant women from 28 weeks of gestation, and recommended for elderly adults if not received in the previous 10 years. Any pilgrim unsure of their Tdap vaccination status should get vaccinated. Hepatitis B risks at Hajj include sharing of razors to shave heads by men to mark the conclusion of Hajj. The NIP has a 4-dose schedule of hepatitis B at birth, 2, 4 and 6 months of age, but Australianborn adults and migrants may not be immunised, vaccination should be considered.

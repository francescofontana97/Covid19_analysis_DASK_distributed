They exploited this sequence difference to design a human-safe inhibitor containing methanethiosulfonate that selectively and irreversibly formed a covalent disulphide bond to the cysteine in the insect enzyme.",

By adding a methanethiol (CH 2 SH) group to the C12 atom of the ligand we bring the introduced sulphur atom within covalent bonding distance of the cysteine with proper stereochemistry (see Figure 1 ). (To achieve this structure with a drug applicable in vivo, the ligand would be not methanethiol but, for instance, methanethiosulfonate as in Pang, et al. 2 ) In addition, we note that a hydroxyl group added to C6 of the ligand could form a hydrogen bond to the sidechain of His41, and that an amino group added to C11 could form a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Phe140.",

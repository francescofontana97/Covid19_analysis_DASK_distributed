A timely rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 cross-sectional studies and a total of 33,062 participants provided early evidence that a high proportion of healthcare professionals experienced significant levels of anxiety, depression and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic [8] . However, a specific sleep evaluation in HPCD is still lacking, which is necessary for understanding how the state of their sleep during the pandemic can be supported to optimize coping strategies to improve symptoms of sleep disorders and to facilitate the implementation of preventive interventions in the future. Therefore, the aim of this study was first to investigate and to analyze the actual sleep situation among HPCD exposed to COVID-19 in China.

HPCD were in daily contact with critically ill patients, working for long hours, resting in designated hotels, and with an uncertain time for returning back home, which led to lack of communication with family and friends and social support. HPCD faced more stress and more easily had mental health issues. Individual perceptions and evaluation of emotional regulating ability may play a key role in efforts to self-regulate emotions among HPCD. RESE refers to the assessment of self-efficacy in managing negative emotions, such as the perceived capability to ameliorate negative emotions in response to stressful or adverse events and to avoid being submerged by emotions [23] . According to our novel findings, exposure history had an indirect effect on sleep status by mediating regulatory emotional self-efficacy. Exposure history and peer diagnosis could have psychological impacts, such as infection-related worries, anxiety and depression. Individuals with low RESE tend to perceive themselves as incapable of managing their emotions effectively, which means they would not be able to manage their emotions effectively and would more easily immerse themselves in negative emotions [24] . Previous studies have shown that negative emotions play a critical role in developing worse sleep quality. We did not measure mental health status, but the model can also explain why emotional self-efficacy plays a role in mediating sleep quality.",

First, exposure is a risk factor for sleeping disorders, including exposure history, perceived peer exposure and peer diagnosis. Second, is the participant's degree of emotional self-efficacy. Third, a sleeping disorder defined by the scores. The fourth area was working conditions, including working days in Wuhan, working hours per day in an isolation area, frequency of time spent in a medical area, time/week. There was collinearity between perceived peer exposure and peer diagnosis. We deleted the variable of perceived peer exposure in the analysis. The chi-square test of model fit yielded a value of 29.5, with 10 degrees of freedom, P value = 0.001 RMSEA = 0.043, CFI = 0.983, and TLI =0.964, indicating a good fit.

The final section is scheduled to measure mental health status of the respondents. Stress on work environment measured using STAI questionnaire (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), introduced by Spielberger [25] . This part of the questionnaire consists of 40 statements to which the respondent is asked to answer. Through them, we examine transient and permanent stress, measuring the employee's emotional state at the time of completing the questionnaire and how they generally feel. The evaluation is reported in a 4 items scale, at the first 20 questions (transient stress) the answers range from \"Not at all\" to \"Too much\" while for the next 20 questions (permanent stress) the answers range from \"Almost never\" to \"Almost always.\". Furthermore, the research also uses the Depression Anxiety and Stress scale (DASS-21) [26] in order to measure these illnesses on the respondents. The questions are answered in a 4 items Likert scale where range varies from 0 -\"does not apply for me\" to 3-\"does apply for me very much, most of the times\". The STAI and DAS-21 research tools have previously used in research related to the COVID-19 pandemic [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] .",

The majority of our sample (60-65%) demonstrate normal DASS-21 levels, however these scores are relatively lower than the current literature. The mild and moderate levels are between 20-24% of the sample which is higher than the relevant literature. Finally, the severe and extremely severe levels are between 11,7-15% which is significantly higher than the relevant literature [27, 28, 32, [37] [38] [39] .

The Government took instant measures of decongestion of the public such as the cancelation of the upcoming carnival events that compose a period of extreme crowding in many cities. In the following days, the Greek authorities imposed restrictive measures regionally and on March 23, 2020 a national lockdown was imposed as soon as the number of positive COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths started to increase. Due to the high transmissibility, Lockdown was an option for the most European countries in an effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.

The results of the study suggest a high and significant correlation between variables at table 11: work stress, stress, anxiety and depression are highly linked.

The results show that these factors are the gender, the age, the income level and the place of living size. The female subgroup has significantly higher Depression, Stress and Anxiety levels, younger respondents have significantly higher State and Trait Anxiety levels, low-income workers have significantly lower Anxiety, State and Trait Anxiety levels and sample that lives in a place less than 50m 2 has significantly higher Trait Anxiety scores. The findings are similar to the relevant literature within the period of the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe: the female subgroups are reported having a significantly higher anxiety, stress and depression level[18,[38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46], Another group of increased Depression, Anxiety or Stress levels within the relevant literature is the younger sub-group",

            "text": "The current pandemic of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease due to SARS-CoV-2 has 3 led to a substantial increase in the demands on acute and critical care services in hospitals 4 around the world. Even modest numbers of critically ill COVID-19 patients are rapidly exceeding 5 existing hospital capacity. Although a minor or moderate surge can be accommodated by 6 employing conventional and contingency surge strategies such as conserving, substituting, 7 adapting and re-using existing resources, current experiences from other countries managing 8 COVID-19 suggest that the magnitude of the surge will substantially exceed capacity, 9 necessitating a crisis surge response 1-4 . The clinical demands will exceed the ability to provide 10 one or more crucial resources essential to deliver basic critical care, therefore necessitating 11 decisions regarding the re-allocation of resources. This potential requires preparation of a 12 triage system to best allocate available critical care resources to meet severe surge in order to 13 maximize benefit for the greatest number of people. 4, 5 Importantly, this triage system should 14 only be deployed as a last resort and implemented as resources become limited and after all 15 attempts to surge, move patients, or shift resources from regions with greater availability have 16 been made. 17 18 When implemented, triage must be applied to all current and new patients presenting with 19 critical illness, regardless of the diagnosis of COVID-19 or another illness, while maintaining 20 underlying ethical principles of social justice, beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for persons 21 and their dignity, veracity and the need to uphold trust within society, and fidelity to one 22 another within health systems. We must uphold our duty to care for all patients, even those 23 3 v200409 unable to receive critical care interventions. In order to enact this triage plan, a triage decision 1 support protocol, infrastructure, processes, legal and regulatory protections and training 5 are 2 required, all of which are currently lacking in most institutions and regions . 3 4 Additionally, there is a need to ensure that patients who do not initially receive critical care 5 resources are still provided the best supportive care possible and are re-evaluated, at minimum 6 daily, for consideration of resource allocation as supplies become available. This will result in a 7 sliding scale from crisis to contingency and flexibility should be anticipated. The absence of a 8 triage system, consistently applied within and between hospitals, may lead to unnecessary 9 deaths, increased moral distress for front-line clinicians, and a lack of public confidence in the 10 fairness of scarce resource allocation. It is important to recognize that the initiation of adult 11 triage levels does not itself imply initiation of pediatric triage (or vice versa). However, 12 dependent on the level of impact within the pediatric system, pediatric hospitals will need to 13 consider lower level triage initiation at a point when adult systems have reached crisis triage, in 14 order to respect the principles of utility and fairness population-wide. 15 16 With appropriate critical care surge planning, we hope that the use of a triage plan that limits 17 the delivery of critical care should be rare, but the potential consequences of failing to prepare 18 for this eventuality are serious. 19 20 COVID-19 is due to a novel coronavirus that can cause severe acute respiratory illness. Early 5 experience with the virus in China and Italy suggests that the virus has a community 6 symptomatic attack rate of COVID-19 of up to 30% (with approximately double that number of 7 SARS-CoV-2 infections, since up to half of cases appear to be asymptomatic or 8 paucisymptomatic). Of these, as many as 5-25% may require hospital admission, 5-8% may 9 require intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 2-4% may require mechanical ventilation for 10 acute respiratory failure. For example, in the greater New York City metropolitan area alone 11 (with a population of 8.4 million people), a community attack rate of 35% (i.e., a symptomatic 12 attack rate of 17.5%), leading to 1.3 million people with varying levels of disease from now until 13 9 v200409 mid-summer, could generate up approximately 88,000 total hospitalizations and 13,000 ICU 1 admissions under a scenario in which 7% of all affected persons require hospitalization and 14% 2 of those require critical care beds. Under a more severe scenario (20% hospitalized and 24% to 3 ICU, rates now seen during the week of 23 March 2020 at New York City hospitals), this could 4 lead to up to 190,000 hospitalizations and 58,000 ICU admissions over the course of the 5 pandemic, with a peak concurrent ICU census of approximately 22,000 before summer. At 6 baseline, the United States has approximately 68,000 adult and 5,000 pediatric ICU beds, a per 7 capita ICU bed availability that exceeds most other countries. 6 Clearly, either scenario is likely 8",

            "text": "10 Triage is the course of action that we take when we have exhausted our ability to expand our 11 critical care resources, that is, to surge. Surge capacity refers to the ability of a hospital or 12 other health care system to expand its normal operating capacity in the setting of an 13 emergency. Surge capacity includes the key features of \"staff, space, supplies, and systems\" 14 with \"communications\" as a critical fifth feature. All five of these elements are necessary to 15 permit hospitals to surge effectively in disasters. The Task Force for Mass Critical Care (TFMCC) 16 provided a classification system for differing levels of surge response in their 2014 guidelines on 17 the management of the critically-ill during disasters and pandemics 3 : 18 19 Conventional capacity: A hospital should be able to increase its critical care capacity by 20 approximately 20% above its normal limitations. This level would be implemented in major 21 mass-casualty incidents that trigger activation of the hospital emergency operations plan. Most 22 v200409 facilities should be able to achieve this level of response using existing staffing and resources, 1 including strategies such as cancellation of elective procedures and transferring of appropriate 2 patients out of ICUs. 3 4 Contingency capacity: This level would be used during a disaster whose medical demands 5 significantly exceeded routine hospital and community resources. At this level, a hospital will 6 expand its critical care capacity by up to 100%, in part through modification of existing spaces 7 and expanding the use of certain staff members. For example, critical care services may be 8 provided in a post-anesthesia care unit, stepdown unit, or other high-dependency area with 9 cross-training of staff under the direction of critical care team members. Ventilators intended 10 for the operating room, non-invasive ventilation, or transport can be repurposed to augment 11 the overall ventilator supply. At this level of surge response, it can be expected that medical 12 care will be at or near the pre-disaster prevailing community standard. 13 14 Crisis capacity: This level would be implemented in catastrophic situations, such as suggested 15 by the current COVID-19 modelling, that result in a significant impact on the standard of 16 medical care that can be provided. Severe limitations of space, staff, and supplies would not 17 allow hospitals to provide the usual standard of medical care. At this level, hospitals and 18 communities will need to consider triage principles. 19 20 It is important to note that the numbers provided above are a construct, not absolute rules. As 21 the balance of resources versus demand shifts over time during an emergency, the degree of 22 v200409 the surge response and any necessary triage will shift as well (figure 1). Shortages of trained 1 staff, ventilators, or of personal protective equipment (PPE) are very real threats in the current 2 pandemic and will likely be triggers for shifting to triage and crisis standards of care if they 3 should occur. As such, we need to have an accurate inventory of those resources, 4 understanding that the limitations would likely be staff rather than ventilators or space, 5 although the ongoing experiences in New York suggest that all three may easily be in short 6 supply. However, the early experience in Italy, which has roughly the same number of ICU beds 7 and ventilators per capita as many other developed countries, indicates that our current critical 8 care resources are insufficient to manage a similar outbreak. 9 10 2. A triage plan is necessary to ensure the greatest benefit to the greatest number, and to 11 reduce the number of patients who will be unable to receive critical care resources. 12 13 A number of pandemic triage plans have already been proposed for viral respiratory illness and 14 are outlined in a recent overview on triage 7 . When the demand for critical care overwhelms the 15 resources available, a resource allocation plan is essential in order to deliver both the greatest 16 benefit to the greatest number of people, as well as to maintain the function of the health care 17 system and prevent random or otherwise inequitable distribution of scarce resources. 18 19 Triage require us to accept the fact that some individuals will not receive critical care resources 20 which might have been dedicated to their care under normal circumstances, while some 21 individuals will have critical care interventions withdrawn if they fail to improve. Although as 22 v200409 yet untested in practice, modeling studies evaluating predicted mortality in pandemics have 1 demonstrated that more people will die due to lack of critical care resources than would have 2 died if triage systems were implemented 8, 9 . Without a triage plan, patients will receive critical 3 care resources by random chance or a first-come, first-serve basis, likely leading to overall 4 worse outcomes across a population and more individuals being denied critical care. 5 6 A triage system requires an ethical basis, which we summarize in figure 2. Limiting and 7 withdrawing critical care resources are justified by the utilitarian principle of providing the 8 greatest good to the greatest number of people. While the general principle of \"saving the most 9 lives possible\" holds true in any system, the decisions of identifying which patients to prioritize 10 for access to critical care will be difficult. A \"first-come, first-served\" model of triage has the 11 advantage of simplicity but will exclude patients who lack transportation or easy access to care. 12",

Therefore, we propose triage protocols that are not 20 solely dependent on SOFA (or another single scoring tool), as SOFA is unlikely to be adequate in 21 and of itself for triage decisions. It is important to mention that any scoring system at this stage 22 v200409 of the pandemic will need to be pragmatic and combine other predictors of ICU mortality, such 1 as disease-specific indicators for non-COVID-19 conditions, frailty scores, comorbidity indices, 2 and physician judgement as best possible. This will need to be balanced against the need for a 3 triage scoring tool that is actionable: complex enough to provide prognostic information with 4 acceptable accuracy, but simple enough to be implemented in a timely manner. 5 6 As our knowledge of COVID-19 increases, it is likely that better prognostic scoring tools will be 7 developed; when this occurs, triage systems should incorporate these into their protocols in 8 order to improve our prediction of critical care outcomes and mitigate the limitations of 9 physiological indices in isolation. 10 11 Periodic reassessment of patients is a necessary part of any triage algorithm, to assess for 12 clinical improvement, deterioration, or any other changes that affect prognosis.

This use of PPE by visitors and caregivers will become increasingly problematic 12 considering worldwide shortages, with some centers reportedly only permitting their use by 13 visitors at crucial contact times, such as the end of life. These limitations in family contact can 14 only increase the burden of suffering, and new methods will be needed to reduce this burden, 15 to include the use of technological solutions (such as video conferencing via tablets and 16 smartphones) to attempt to preserve as much intrapersonal contact as possible. 30 17 18 With the use of triage algorithms in crisis care, even the most transparent systems of decision-19 making may lead to prolonged feelings of guilt from lack of personal preparedness, an inability 20 to assist, or frustration toward the government and the medical system.

It is additionally important to anticipate and plan for 3 supporting these professionals, who themselves will require support due to secondary moral 4 distress. 5 6 8. Healthcare Worker support 7 8 The term \"moral injury\" has been increasingly suggested to describe the distress that HCWs can 9 experience from the excessive demands of energy, strength, and resources often experienced 10 within current healthcare systems. 31 The resulting constellation of symptoms -fatigue, 11 frustration, cynicism, and inefficiency -has historically been defined as \"burnout\", but this term 12 fails to capture the similarities that this syndrome may share with post-traumatic stress 13 disorder or the severity of the associated psychological injury. 32 The principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence are core to the practices of medicine and 1 nursing, and the impact of asking clinicians to shift their perspective during a crisis surge 2 response should not be underestimated. 6 Feelings of social isolation are common in times of 3 crisis and are further exacerbated by current recommendations for social distancing, infection 4 control practices, and prolonged use of PPE. Disruptions in normal routines, concern for 5 personal welfare, and fear for the safety of loved ones all add additional stress. A significant 6 number of physicians in active practice already exhibit signs and symptoms of moral injury, with 7 higher self-reported rates of poor patient safety habits, more medical errors in their practice, 8 and increased rates of suicidal ideation. 33 The personal risk to bedside clinicians during the 9 COVID-19 pandemic, especially in light of international shortages of PPE, only increases this 10 strain on the workforce. This can be a significant threat to both the quality and efficiency of 11 care in a crisis. 12 13 Providing members of the healthcare team with structured opportunities to debrief after 14 critical events and ongoing opportunities for engagement and input to improve the inevitably 15 dynamic work environment have also been shown to be effective to promote community, 16 connectedness, and meaning. Incorporating these principles thoughtfully during triage system 17 activation requires a systematic leadership communication plan to explain the reasons for its 18 use; formal training to ensure consistent implementation; and collaborative, team-based 19 approaches to decision making led by the designated triage officers and including clinicians 20 directly caring for patients with the strong support of hospital ethics and palliative care experts .  21   22   25   v200409 Similarly, institutions and governments must prevent the sanctioning of HCWs for attempting to 1 protect their own (and their families') safety through non-standard PPE usage; instead, 2 healthcare organizations need to redouble efforts to expand PPE availability, be it through 3 innovative re-usage methods, adoption of acceptable alternative forms of PPE (e.g., the use of 4 industrial respirators), and governmental and industry support for increased manufacturing. 5 6 Existing resilience measures and support programs will need to be strengthened to protect the 7 psychological well-being of patients, families, and the HCWs treating them both during and 8 after these events. 5 It is wise to consider a structured schedule of opportunities within each 9 work unit and the hospital at large to encourage staff to learn about and utilize these measures, 10 especially in the setting of anticipated prolonged periods of modified work practices that the 11 current COVID-19 pandemic threatens to create. 12",

Pediatric Considerations. 4 5 Any triage system must balance the need to save the most lives possible with the need to save 6 total life-years. Critically-ill children therefore are usually considered separately from adults 7 when triage considerations are made. The fundamental precepts of crisis critical care -including 8 care and attention to the health of the entire family as a unit and respect for the role of parents 9 -remain critical to the success of disaster management. Institutions must balance the needs of 10 family-centered care versus the risk of disease transmission. One or more caregivers usually 11 accompany pediatric patients; these caregivers are likely to be close contact with a patient and 12 should be treated as a presumably exposed, though they may be asymptomatic at the time, and 13 will require monitoring for symptomatic disease and potential quarantine. 14 15 Incorporating children into a regional triage algorithm is complicated for a disease process such 16 as COVID-19 that largely affects adults, at least in terms of critical illness. Much of pediatric 17 critical care is separated into very few pediatric centers, with only some pediatric resources 18 being applicable to adult groups. In order to prevent any hospital from needing to use crisis 19 standards of care, pediatric-only hospitals in an affected region have a duty to surge to prevent 20 adult and mixed adult/pediatric hospitals going into crisis as regional capacity needs require. In 21 such a scenario, pediatric-only hospitals should consider steps outlined in table 1 above.  22  v200409   1 Pediatric care should preferably be concentrated in pediatric centers to preserve necessary 2 pediatric systems. Given the low mortality of most conditions with which children are admitted 3 to intensive care (<5%), patients <18 years of age who meet the mortality criteria associated 4 with the adult triage levels will be very rare, such that the adoption of the same triage system in 5 pediatrics is unlikely to mobilize further resources. An entirely different algorithm that is 6 pediatric-specific would be necessary in considering pediatric specific triage policies. Some 7 centers have modeled situations where a certain mortality rate or predicted ventilator-days 8 could preclude the offering of invasive ventilator support to some children at a time of 9 significantly increased short-term ventilator needs 8 , but there is a paucity of pediatric-specific 10 data to guide such triage. Medical specifics aside, the guiding ethical principles remain the same 11 for pediatric triage and should still be applied. 12 13 Pediatric centers should regionally activate pediatric triage when shared pediatric resources 14 (accounting for transportation capacity) are exhausted, with mortality predictions subject to 15 expert opinion which should be agreed upon and documented by at least two members of the 16 treating team. Prior to movement to higher triage levels, especially considering such steps 17 being unlikely to mobilize resources, discussions should be held regarding movement of 18 ventilators to pediatric centers from adult sites if there is a difference in resource demand. 19 ",

These codes are then grouped into concepts and then into categories which are used to generate a theory about the data. Six categories were identified from their analysis: (1) efficiency and structure of interview day, (2) diverse fellowship trained faculty, (3) program culture and collegiality, (4) surgical and clinical training, (5) research, and (6) program benefits and location.",

The data set comes from an anonymous, open online forum, (https://www.uro logymatch.com/). Therefore, the authors could not verify who the commenters were and could not know the number of unique respondents. It is entirely possible that some of the comments were not even from applicants and may have come from residents (current or former) or even faculty from the institutions being studied. Furthermore, because of the way the forum is formatted, the authors were not able to tell where 1 person's comment ended and another one started. The comments were independently analyzed by 2 of the authors. However, we are not provided with any details on how they came to agreement on coding and organizing the information. Lastly, the data can only tell us how often a particular category was commented on. Yet, we do not know how much these aspects truly mattered to the applicant and to what degree, if any, it influenced their decisions on how to rank programs.",

Because of how the Urology Match Google Sheet was formatted, there were challenges in quantifying certain aspects of the data and the analyses.The forum was independently read by both reviewers and a list of codes was generated and updated throughout the process. Coding is a method in which the researcher takes notes about what is said and searches for themes in the process. Themes were then identified through similar groupings of codes. For example, comments like \"this program had 15-minute interviews\" or \"30-minute interviews\" were coded as Interview Length. Similar codes including Interview Number and Interview Day Duration could belong together in a theme of \"Structure of Interview Day.\" Thematic categories were discussed and combined between the two coders and found be similar. The fact that both coders independently generated the same 6 thematic categories through this process speaks to the strengths of the themes within the data.These results of our study are certainly timely. As away rotations have been affected at many institutions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the interviews will hold more weight for applicants and programs alike. We hope that these results can help residency programs optimize their interview day to provide an educational and positive experience for the applicants. ",

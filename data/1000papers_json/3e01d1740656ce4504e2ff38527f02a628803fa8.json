In a study of 150 confirmed COVID-19 cases, predictors of mortality included elevated concentrations of ferritin and IL-6, suggesting a virally driven hyper inflammation, 16 sharing common features with other auto inflammatory disorders, either inherited or acquired (such as adult Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, or chimeric antigen receptor [CAR] T-cell-mediated cytokine release syndrome).

Similar findings in an Italian study suggest that it is unlikely that ana kinra might be causally linked to such abnormalities in these patients. 25 The implication of a coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 strengthens the importance of the detection and management of thromboembolic events. 27 Although such events were not systematically investigated in our study, ten (19%) patients in the anakinra group and five (11%) in the historical group developed such a complication during the hospital stay. Our data did not allow us to determine whether the inhibition of IL-1 was beneficial or detrimental respective to COVID-19-related coagulopathy. Although it has been established that IL-1 increases the level of tissue factor, one of the main activators of coagulation, published data are somewhat contradictory about the effect of blocking IL-1 on coagulability. 28, 29 Our study has several limitations. Taking into account the poor prognosis of COVID-19-related ARDS and the devastating progression of the pandemic, we decided an off-label use of anakinra for all patients with severe forms of the disease. Therefore, the anakinra cohort was compared with an historical group of patients. Con sequently, a physician learning curve bias could be hypothesised. However, the recruitment of historical patients in the same institution, during a very short 2-week period is likely to limit this bias. Second, the historical group differed sizeably from the anakinra group for several potentially confounding variables. Obesity was more frequent in the historical group and might have worsened the effects of SARS-CoV-2. 30 In the multivariate analysis of our data, this comorbidity, as well as the other betweengroup differences, did not affect the estimated effect of anakinra on the outcome. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed association could be due, at least in part, to confounding.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 619, "end": 621, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 907, "end": 909, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1057, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1632, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1635, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2385, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Number at risk (number censored)"}, {"text": "In conclusion, in severe forms of COVID-19-related pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy, a 10-day treatment with subcutaneous anakinra was associated with the reduction of both need of mechanical ventilation and mortality, as compared with a historical group with similar characteristics.

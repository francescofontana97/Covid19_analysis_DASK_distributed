            "text": "COVID-19 causes a disease with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic, mild to severe disease. We report a case of serological blood group discrepancy and cold agglutinin autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with the novel coronavirus. There are two types of cold agglutinin disease (CAD). The Primary CAD is idiopathic and secondary CAD is associated with autoimmune disorders and viral infections. In CAD, agglutination of red blood cells occurs at below normal body temperature and is associated with extravascular hemolysis leading to hemolytic anemia [1] .",

There was a noticeable increase in CRP and a drop in Hb to 6.0g/dl coinciding with the worsening of pneumonia. Total leukocyte count was 5.98 X10 3/ microliter and platelet count was 30X 10 3 / Microliter. His course was further complicated by progressive thrombocytopenia, with a nadir of a platelet count of 20 X 10 3 / microliter. Reticulocyte count was 1.15%. Urea was elevated to 105.34mg/dl and creatinine to 2.01mg/dl. He developed renal failure and renal replacement therapy was advised. Alkaline phosphatase was 310.21U/L. Serum bilirubin was elevated to 7.76mg/dl, and unconjugated bilirubin was 2.91 mg/dl. Total protein was low (4.24g/L), Albumin was 2.03g/L. The presence of target cells and spherocytes in blood films was observed indicative of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) [2] . The patient's sample was received in the blood bank for blood grouping and cross-matching. The results of cell and serum grouping showed ABO discrepancy ( Table 1) . Crossmatch was performed using auto-adsorbed prewarmed serum by Tulip gel cards, and Rh matched compatible units were selected for the patient. Blood grouping was done by tube technique and extended Rh phenotype for ANTI-C, ANTI-c, ANTI-E, ANTI-e was done by Tulip reagents. A cold agglutinin titer was performed using pooled O Cells from donors, and phosphate buffer saline and patient serum separated and kept at 37 degrees Celcius. Serial dilution was prepared, and titer was negative at 37 degrees Celcius, the titer of 2 at room temperature, and a titer of 64 at 4 degrees Celcius was observed. This antibody reacted with all patient and donor RBCs at cold temperatures.",

Nevertheless, the prevalence and implications of such findings remain to be elucidated. The thermal amplitude of cold agglutinins in our study was zero at 37 degrees centigrade and 64 at 4 degrees Celsius and caused ABO Discrepancy and interfered with cross-matching. In our case, the antibody specificity of cold agglutinin could not be determined. However, the cold antibody reacted with the patient's and donor red blood cells (RBCs) at cold temperatures. The management included avoidance of cold exposure, maintaining haemoglobin, and treatment of underlying etiology. The serological blood group and cross match discrepancy observed in our case was resolved using the prewarmed saline wash technique, and the use of auto adsorbed serum. The limiting factor in our study was our inability to document the antibody specificity in cold agglutinin autoimmune hemolytic anemia and the association with other illnesses like atypical pneumonia infection, which may be associated with novel coronavirus.",

Reverse grouping at 4 degrees Celcius showed increased agglutination of B and O cells, suggesting the presence of cold agglutinins. This antibody reacted with all patient and donor RBCs at cold temperatures. Both the Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tube and plane tube were kept at 37 degrees Celcius. Prewarmed saline kept at 37 degrees Celcius was used to wash one ml of red cells of the patient. Cell grouping was done with red cells washed with prewarmed saline in prewarmed tubes with anti-A, Anti B, and Anti AB. A 5% red cell suspension of A, B, and O cells were made and kept at 37 degrees. Patient serum was separated and kept at 37 degrees centigrade for 1 hr. An equal volume of serum and Red cells were incubated at 37 degrees for 45 minutes. The auto-adsorbed serum was used for cross-matching. A Prewarmed pipette tip was used for cell and serum grouping and cross-matching. The ABO Discrepancy was resolved with a warm saline wash of patient red cells and the use of prewarmed serum for serum grouping, and the results are elaborated inTable 2.",

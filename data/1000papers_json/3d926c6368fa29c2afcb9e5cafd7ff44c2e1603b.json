In this regard and due to the high infection rate of this pandemic, specialists advise social distancing for unaffected people or supportive care cure for hospitalized ones (Lai et al., 2020; Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020; C. Wang et al., 2020) . On the other hand, since the COVID-19 pandemic is highly contagious and the cases are increasing (as you can see in Fig. 1) , designing a supply chain network while devising new strategies that efficiently exploit hospitals, medical clinics, and other potential places are inevitable and crucial in this situation (Ochalek et al., 2020) . 2-1-2020 2-7-2020 2-13-2020 2-19-2020 2-25-2020 3-2-2020 3-8-2020 3-14-2020 3-20-2020 3-26-2020 4-1-2020 4-7-2020 4-13-2020 4-19-2020 4-25-2020 5-1-2020 5-7-2020 5-13-2020 5-19-2020 5-25-2020 5-31-2020 6-6-2020 6-12-2020 6-18-2020 6-24-2020 6-30-2020 7-6-2020 7-12-2020 7-18-2020 7-24-2020 7-30-2020 8-5-2020 8-11-2020 8-17-2020 8-23-2020 8-29-2020 9-4-2020 9-10-2020 9-16-2020 9-22-2020 9-28-2020 10-4-2020 10-10-2020 10-16-2020 10-22-2020 10-28-2020 11-3-2020 11-9-2020 11-15-2020 11-21-2020 11-27-2020 12-3-2020 12-9-2020 12-15-2020 12-21-2020 12-27-2020 1-2-2021 1- While human life is the most important factor facing these pandemics (Karlsson et al., 2014) , many major worldwide industries affected notoriously. Gigantic industries including business tourism and travel, aviation, oil, high tech, and much other business and automotive sectors have decreased in their growth rate due to total quarantine and decrease in demand rate. For instance, the effect of COVID-19 on the two major industries is illustrated in Fig. 2 . This issue derived many business managers to implement new approaches to both cost reduction and fatality rates. This major impact on the different economy would result in a reduction in total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in many countries especially in Asia where the pandemic aroused and later to developed countries, such as the United States, since most countries' resources would spend on health section to face and address myriad patients. Moreover, relying on supply chain concepts would be beneficial especially in-home health (Glied & Hong, 2018; Milburn, 2012) . In this regard, utilizing the healthcare section with supply chain settings not only survive many lives, but also from the economic perspective reduces the total costs regarding this issue. This is a vital subject because in most governments the medical resources are somehow limited and in a long run, there would be a lot of fatigue among these participants. Generally, relief supply refers to the supply of vital materials such as social welfare, food, water, medication, clothes, etc. for people who are in a harsh environment like disaster areas. Relief supply chain network includes designing an efficient scheme for these critical situations (Davoodi & Goli, 2019; Shu et al., 2021) . Meaning that utilizing emergency management activities with relief supply chain design, could notoriously affect the medical section performance and also helps the manager by the means if strategic decisions (Ellis et al., 2015) . Accordingly, delivering the right amount of medical items when everything including demand rate dynamically changes is highly regarded (Hajiaghaei-Keshteli & Sajadifar, 2010; Hong et al., 2015; Safaei et al., 2018) . According to Altay & Green III, (2006) , we can devide relief operations into four different categories which are (1) preparation for the incident, (2) mitigation, (3) immediate response after the incident, and (4) reconstruction after the incident. Among the mentioned criteria, emergency management involves planning for pre-and-post and also during a disaster with the aim of immediate response (Ghaffari et al., 2020) .",

One possible solution to track each suspected case is to design a special mobile (android or ios) application in which people could simply register and fill in simple questions to verify their related symptoms. This practical and user-friendly application can detect the probability of infection by asking simple questions from its users. If the probability of infection reaches a certain predefined rate, it can call its center where a special ambulance approaches different homes which are situated in various sits for further examination. At the time of detection of any possible suspected case, the control center programs the visitation of each patient dynamically and based on their critical condition. Hence, the program whether allocates ambulances or prioritize the suspected case based on the current situation and in a dynamic fashion. After planning and finding an optimal route based on timing, the control center notifies each ambulance and even updates their current route. Therefore, special devices such as routers, Bluetooth devices, special WIFI connection, and antenna are mobilized in both control center and also ambulances with a fast internet connection to send and receive data about the current plan or any possible changes.

Actually, each sub-area expresses an ambulance. \uf0b7 The distance, traffic, and capacity of each sub-area is known. Although it is important to identify patients, it is equally important to respond to more suspected people in the shortest possible time. Each CMC covers the treatment area (town, a part of the city, city, and etc.), which is divided into several sub-areas due to the size of the area. Each sub-area has a different size, distance from the CMC, traffic jam, and population density. As a result, suspected cases may have different accessibility and responsivity times in each sub-area. The number of suspected cases in each sub-area does not follow a specific pattern. Probably, the number of suspected cases in some sub-areas might be more than in others. Therefore, the allocation of suspected cases to each sub-area (ambulance) only based on geographical location would significantly increase the number of suspected cases (needing a visit) in some sub-areas from the others. In addition, the capacity of the ambulance and response time will not be determined. Hence, before prioritizing the ambulance route, the suspected cases should be assigned to the ambulance (sub-area) based on the capacity, distance, and traffic of each sub-area. Therefore, two sub-models are needed in order to firstly allocate suspected cases to each sub-areas (ambulances) and secondly to prioritize the visit of each suspected case for each ambulance. Considering two sub-models has been utilized in previous papers such as (Jun-yan et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2018) .",

In order to add two values in one objective function, the distance difference of each suspected case from the ideal distance and the difference between each sub-area traffic and ideal traffic are divided into their ideal, respectively. As a result, the amount of obtained distance and traffic for each assigned suspected case doesn't have a module. So, they can be minimized with a single objective function. The same approach is considered in Hwang et al. (1980) . Constraint (2) ensures that each suspected case is assigned to only one sub-area.

The next step is to allocate each ambulance to each individual based on distance and current traffic. Now if based on the first defined model each individual (due to its geographical location and living place) is not assigned to an ambulance, the results might be a decrease in calculation time, but there is still a possibility that identified cases in various districts may be varied.

After solving the sub-model one, three suspected cases were assigned to each ambulance and then in sub-model two, the response time is achieved 303.025 minutes with one severity case. The sensitivity analyses on different parameters are shown in Fig. 12 (a)-(d) . Fig. 12. (a) illustrates that the more number of ambulances, the more the response time. In this regard, if the system utilizes more ambulances (sub-areas), then the response time would decrease (or more suspected cases are visited in a shorter time). This strategy would release the pressure on CMC and make it more convenient to confront the increasing rate of the outbreak. On the other hand, an increase in the number of ambulances always doesn't lead to a decrease in the response time. Hence, managers would assign available resources to CMCs optimally to both decreasing the response time and preventing the allocation of extra resources. It is also notable to mention that an increase in the number of ambulances up to four does not change the response time as shown in Fig. 12. (a) . Fig. 12. (b) suggests that if the number of severe cases increases, then the response time would increase. It is due to the fact that the number of returned ambulances to the CMC has to be enhanced for further medical care cures. Here, the proposed IoT system contributes to an effective decision-making process for managers to optimize the visit priorities by instant alteration in the number of returned cases dynamically. In addition, improving a system of primary evaluation (IoT-based) would allow for better identification of the suspected cases and severity condition. As a result, the level of utilizing a system with better input settings (COVID-19 virus symptoms), the overall programming time, and also response time would decrease.",

The fourth scenario is similar to the third scenario (identifying new suspected cases after scheduling) except that four patients are identified at once after the first trip of the ambulance. Scenarios three and four show that the lack of an IoT (re-planning after each change) greatly increases the number of trips and the total response time in comparison with the IoT system (instant scheduling by any change). In general, the more changes, the more difference between the total response time and ambulance's trips of the two systems (See Fig. 16 and 17) .

In scenario five, the severity of the first priority suspected case increases so that this person should be transferred to the medical center for specialized treatments. In scenario six, the severity of the first and third identified suspected cases (suspected case one and three) increase. What stands out in Fig. 17 and 18 is the difference between two systems with IoT and without IoT. Although the amount of these factors is enhanced in two systems (with IoT and without IoT), but the increase in a system without IoT is much more than a system with IoT.",

Exerting such a system showed that potential affected COVID-19 cases could easily be identified with a simple mobile application and the system automatically sends ambulances to these cases for treatment agendas and if needed take the patients back to the main medical center for further care cures.

On the other hand, the accuracy and reliability of the current system could bring governments to the consensus to utilize its benefits in their nations worldwide as the outputs of the system are transparent and the planning is delicate. In this regard, the proposed IoT system is enabled to update the routes in the case of any change. It is found that instant changes significantly increase the response time in which the proposed IoT system has decreased the effects of such conditions. Considering such scheme enabled the model to visit each suspected case with an ambulance in which the shortest possible distance/traffic is selected. As a result, all suspected cases have been visited in the shortest time and based on their severities. Verifying the changes in the number of ambulances, visiting time, and ambulance sanitizing time revealed that the total response time was initially affected by these changes. However, utilizing IoT could effectively reduce the impacts of the changes.",

Besides, further research needs to examine more closely the links between supply chain management and IoT by urging people to cooperate more with the current system and to use medical applications especially in the time of major outbreaks.

The study population was selected from a single institution. All three patients with AKI underwent mechanical ventilation and ECMO, and it was difficult to distinguish whether AKI was caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection or was associated with treatments, such as ECMO and vancomycin. 24,25 Therefore, it is possible that the incidence of AKI related to COVID-19 was overestimated. In fact, all three patients used both ECMO and vancomycin, and AKI developed after vancomycin use. 26 Therefore, it is thought that AKI is more likely to be associated with the treatment than with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the likelihood of AKI being associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be lower. In addition, when tubular damage, namely, acute tubular necrosis, occurred, a follow-up of more than 2-4 weeks after improvement of infection was considered sufficient 27,28 ; however, due to insufficient follow-up, it was difficult to evaluate whether there was an improvement in proteinuria. Finally, it was difficult to tell whether it was proteinuria caused by kidney damage or functional proteinuria caused by fever and infection. In this study, tests for hematuria such as RBC count and dysmorphic RBC were not performed. However, hematuria was also found in eight out of 11 patients with severely increased proteinuria.

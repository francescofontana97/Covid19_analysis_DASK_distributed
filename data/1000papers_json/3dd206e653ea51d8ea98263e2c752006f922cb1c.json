            "text": "Background: Global demand for capacity building has increased interest for eLearning. As eLearning resources become more common, effective implementation is required to scale up utilization in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Objective: This paper describes the process of implementing a malnutrition eLearning course, effectiveness of course delivery models devised, factors affecting course completion, and cost comparison between the models and face-to-face training at healthcare and academic institutions in Ghana. Methods: Four delivery models: Mobile Training Centre (MTC), Online Delivery (OD), Institutional Computer Workstation (ICW) and Mixed Delivery (MD) -a combination of OD and ICW -were determined. Participants were enabled to access the course using one of the four models where contextually appropriate. Pre and post-assessments and questionnaires were administered to compare participants' completion status and knowledge gain between delivery models. The effect of access to computer and Internet at home and relevance of course to job and academic progression on course completion were further investigated. Comparison of delivery model costs against face-to-face training was also undertaken. Results: Of 9 academic and 7 healthcare institutions involving 915 people, 9 used MTC (34.8%), 3 OD (18.8%), 3 ICW (34.2%) and 1 MD (12.2%). Course completion was higher among institutions where the course was relevant to job or implemented as part of required curriculum activities. Knowledge gain was significant among most institutions, but higher among participants who found the course relevant to job or academic progression. The implementation costs per participant for training with MTC were \u00a351.0, OD \u00a32.2, ICW \u00a31.2 and MD \u00a31.1, compared with a face-to-face training estimate of \u00a3105.0 (1 GHS = 0.14 GBP). Conclusion: The malnutrition eLearning course makes global capacity building in malnutrition management achievable. Adopting contextually appropriate delivery models and ensuring training is relevant to job/academic progression can enhance eLearning effectiveness in LMICs.",

This demand, coupled with improved access to internet globally and the fast-advancing digital technologies, has increased the development of technology-enhanced/enabled learning/training interventions, also known as eLearning [2, 3] . As such interventions become more available, it is important to explore their effective implementation and utilization to ensure optimal benefits [4] . Durlak and DuPre, in their systematic review of over 500 prevention and health promotion programmes, reported that implementation factors affected outcomes [5] . Making eLearning interventions available to target users does not of itself ensure they will make use of them. There is therefore a great need to support effective implementation of available eLearning interventions to enable global capacity building [6, 7] .",

Such a goal could be to deliver a curriculum, facilitate flexible learning, widen access to learning/training opportunities or offer continuous professional development (CPD) and in-service training. In order for the goal to be achieved, the eLearning intervention must be implemented appropriately to help realize its intended benefit. Factors, which have been identified to make eLearning implementation and utilization successful, can be summarized into four broad categories [8] . The first is infrastructural support, including hardware, software and information technology (IT) support. In the LMIC setting this also includes availability of electricity. The second is institutional capability and resources, including financial, human, availability of trainers/educators and institutional reorientation from face-to-face to eLearning. The third category is an inbuilt capability to follow up and measure success of eLearning as a means of training. This includes eLearning utilization and measurable achieved outcomes or impacts purposed by the eLearning. The fourth is recognition for eLearning, which involves eLearning integration into curricula and/or recognition as CPD [9, 10] .",

The SSA region accounted for 23% of the global wasting burden in 2016 [13] . In Ghana, the prevalence of moderate or severe wasting was 9% in 2008, 6% in 2011 and 4.7% in 2014, according to the Demographic and Health Survey [14] .

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has provided guidelines on the management of children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) -more commonly known as WHO 'Ten steps' for management of SAM [17] . The guidelines are effective in treating severely malnourished children and, if scaled up, are expected to reduce deaths substantially [18] [19] [20] [21] . The management of SAM is among the list of effective nutrition interventions [21] and is considered a key component of the United Nation's Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) framework. The challenge is how to ensure appropriate management of these children, since it requires effective training/capacity building interventions and implementation of these interventions at scale [22] .",

The course has 3 modules with each taking 2-3 hours to complete. The course is based on the WHO guidelines for the management of SAM and provides learning on: how to differentiate between chronic and acute malnutrition; pathophysiological changes in malnutrition and consequences for treatment; how to assess and screen children for malnutrition and interpret the results for action; how to manage malnourished children using the WHO Ten Steps; hospital compared with community management; the importance of an integrated approach between hospital and community; and how to support mothers and carers to prevent the recurrence of malnutrition. The course is interactive, scenario-based and designed around a hypothetical nutrition community in which children and their care are the focus for learning. The content structure and design support apprehending structure, integration, application and reflection. The content is set at a level suitable for in-service and pre-service health professionals who are, or will be, working with undernourished children. Further details are described elsewhere [30] [31] [32] [33] . Following the development of the malnutrition eLearning course, various dissemination approaches, including institutional grants and best practice awards for curriculum implementation, social media campaigns, exhibitions and regular release of newsletters, were used to encourage and scale up its utilization. These activities led to over 16,000 people across 120 countries using the course by 2016 [30] .",

This study further demonstrates that scaling up capacity/ training in malnutrition management, a recognised challenge in most LMICs [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , is possible through eLearning if it is supported by contextually appropriate delivery and implemented as part of curriculum development or in-service training. Key strategies outlined by UNICEF to expand access to quality treatment of SAM include building national capacities and strengthening systems to support SAM management scale-up for which a well-trained workforce is essential [27] . Despite many calls for capacity building among health professionals in the management of malnutrition [28, 34] , taking the necessary steps to make this happen has not been easy. During MeLE in Ghana, the eLearning course was offered to 938 in-service and pre-service health professionals at 9 healthcare and 7 academic institutions. The numbers of institutions involved and participants trained in this study demonstrate the potential of the course as a scalable training solution for SAM management. The implementation process for the malnutrition eLearning course and findings from the evaluation also offer a practical guide for implementing available eLearning in general to increase access to training and to support its effective utilization in LMICs [1] .",

In Ghana Internet limitations are common [35] and going online can be problematic [36] . Only 3 of the 16 institutions in MeLE had sufficient Internet capacity for online delivery. Limited computer and Internet access however can be overcome. The 9 healthcare institutions in the study had neither workstations nor Internet access. Through setting up a temporary training facility (MTC) using the offline malnutrition eLearning course on the research team's and participants' own computers, the participants were able to take the course. And so were the participants at 4 academic institutions through ICW and MD. The results showed that participants' completion of the course was not determined by delivery models nor access to computer (P = 0.398) and/or Internet (P = 0.134) at home. This indicates that the four delivery models implemented in this study were different but offered equivalent learning/ training opportunities to the participants. Hospitals/ health centres in Ghana organize periodic in-service training, and nationally there is a drive for academic institutions to have workstations equipped with computers [37] . Therefore, this result is important as it offers a way forward for the management of malnutrition and other areas requiring scalable training solutions in Ghana and other LMICs. Previous studies suggested that recognition of eLearning, integrated into curricula and/or recognized as CPD, influences its completion and benefits gained from it [9, 10] , and this was confirmed by the study. The benefits derived from the malnutrition eLearning course were determined by relevance of the course to job and how it was integrated into academic curricula. Two academic institutions in the OD group, CHK and KNUST where the course was integrated as required curriculum activities in the evaluation period, had course completion rates of 100% and 79.4%, respectively. However, only 26.7% of UHAS participants in the OD group where the course was offered as additional learning completed the course.",

Both took part in the pre-assessment but, according to staff, the students complained of having no readily accessible internet access. We surmise that timetabled activities were prioritised for workstations and, as it was optional learning, it was difficult for the students to access computer and Internet during study hours and they also had less motivation to complete the course. The study team subsequently organised an offline version for the institutions but it was then too late for the students to complete the training in the study period. We excluded these institutions from the analysis as no post-assessment scores were available. These observations perhaps underscore the importance of timetabling learning sessions with any eLearning to ensure participants have time to access and take part, as well as the need to strengthen capacity for independent learning, if eLearning is to be effective.",

The cost analysis undertaken suggests that implementing the malnutrition eLearning can reduce the training cost on SAM management as well as increase access to training opportunities. OD, ICW, MD are most cost-effective, needing a minimal staff time for eLearning introduction. MTC incurs a higher cost requiring scheduled sessions even if the training is self-directed. However, it still is less than half the cost of delivering face-toface onsite training. For eLearning that is proven to be effective, these different models should be considered, especially in LMICs, to scale up training of healthcare workforce. The eLearning course was developed in the UK and the initial cost for developing the course was high (\u00a340,000 for a 6-9 hour highly interactive, media-rich eLearning), and development costs may limit the potential of eLearning. However, the main rationale for this paper is to show the feasibility of utilizing available eLearning for scalable capacity building. Furthermore, with many eLearning courses, including massive open online courses (MOOCs), freely available for institutions and individuals to take advantage of, new eLearning development should be considered only if there is no available eLearning. If new eLearning is to be developed, then the initial development costs will have to be addressed. Costs for computers were not included as our aim was to utilize existing resources, which proved possible. Hiring or purchasing computers would increase implementation costs.",

The postassessment score for those who completed the course at UHAS was lower than their preassessment score. UHAS post-study participation rate was low (15/65, 23.1%) and only 4 completed the course. We do not know the reasons for their low study participation but it is likely that the low participation rate, low course completion and no significant improvement between pre and postassessments are associated.",

Suspicion for the disease was high, however, and a follow-up test was positive after an initial negative result. This experience led us to review literature in an effort to clarify the potential improvements in sensitivity that may be offered with sequential testing. Given the often restricted availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers, sufficient test sensitivity could potentially enhance PPE stewardship and mitigate these shortages.",

One publication 3 indicated that the false-negative rate (FNR) of a single nasal swab was 0.37, implying that the dual-sample approach would yield FNR 13.6%, but the sample size in that study was small. Another study 4 has also shown that the FNR varies widely with disease course, reaching its lowest values of roughly 0.26-0.37 on days 3-9 after symptom onset. If these estimates are correct, the FNR of 2 sequential tests would be approximately 6%-12%, and any tests outside the \"Goldilocks\" zone of 3-9 days after symptom onset would have higher FNR. With current high prevalence, the NPV deteriorates further.",

Serology in addition to real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing may bring some refinements in the near future, but at present, we are not fully confident in tests' NPV, even with repeated testing. In the future, when prevalence is hopefully lower and declining, the tests' NPV will be more reassuring. When community transmission is extensive, however, as at the time of this writing, anesthesiologists should consider all patients as potentially SARS-CoV-2 positive and employ appropriate PPE.",

Unfortunately, the value of testing in asymptomatic individuals at this point appears to be as a fallback measure when appropriate PPE is severely restricted or unavailable, and not as a general strategy toward PPE usage reduction.",

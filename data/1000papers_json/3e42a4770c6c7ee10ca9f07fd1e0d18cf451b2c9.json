Lower respiratory specimens such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum have been recommended as the best clinical respiratory specimens for detecting SARS-CoV-2 [5, 6] . Viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 were higher in nasal swabs than those in throat swabs collected from symptomatic COVID-19 patients [7] . e United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has deemed upper respiratory specimens as acceptable for initial diagnostic testing of SARS-CoV-2, and these include nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), nasal swabs, and saliva [8] . Simultaneous collection and placement of NPS and OPS in the universal transport medium (UTM) using two sets of swabs is recommended to increase sensitivity in real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays in Korea, as long as the supply of flocked swabs is not limited [9] . We analyzed the number of patients with COVID-19 that were confirmed as positive using NPS/ OPS by measuring the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 among the patients diagnosed during the screening process in the first outbreak of the disease in Korea. e IVD assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 were not incorporated for testing coinfections with other respiratory pathogens at the time of screening COVID-19 suspects. Recently, coinfections in COVID- 19 have been reported not to neglect infections by other respiratory pathogens in addition to SARS-CoV-2 [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . is suggests that simultaneous testing for coinfections between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens is required to provide a better patient treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic [15] .",

Additionally, based on a comparison of the mean Ct values for the genes specific to SARS-CoV-2, higher viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 were observed in NPS/OPS than in sputum (Figure 2) , which supports that rates of SARS-CoV-2 detection in NPS/OPS are excellent (Figure 1 ). is suggests that NPS/OPS is better than sputum for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in molecular diagnostic assays and that it is unnecessary to enforce sputum sampling, especially from patients who are unable to expectorate. However, in previous studies, sputum specimens were considered superior to nasal samples for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. Pan et al. [6] measured the viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in the throats, sputum, urine, and stool of two COVID-19 patients at the early stage of symptom onset. ey found that the viral loads were higher in sputum samples than in throat samples, especially in the early days after onset. Wang et al. [5] compared the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 across multiple types of specimens collected from patients with COVID-19 and found that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had the highest positive rate (93%), followed by sputum (72%), nasal swab (63%), and pharyngeal swabs (32%). Based on the literature published, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was recommended as the best clinical specimen for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patients, and sputum was the second most strongly recommended specimen, whereas pharyngeal swabs were given a moderate recommendation [23, 24] . In contrast, our data support that pharyngeal swab samples were superior to sputum for detecting SARS-CoV-2 among the study subjects who underwent COVID-19 screening. A finding consistent with that of the current study was also observed in a case study of two Korean patients, which reported that viral loads of upper respiratory specimens (placing both NPS and OPS in the same UTM) were similar to or sometimes higher than those in sputum using RT-PCR detection [25] . e rate of coinfection in patients with COVID-19 (N \ufffd 342) with respiratory pathogens was 8.8% (N \ufffd 30) ( Table 1 ) and 7.9% (N \ufffd 27) and 0.9% (N \ufffd 3) having viral and atypical bacterial coinfections, respectively. e rate of viral coinfection has been previously reported to range from 2.0% to 19.8% in different countries [22, [26] [27] [28] . e coinfection rate with respiratory viruses was 2.0% (N \ufffd 39) among 1,996 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in New York City [26] . At a hospital in Shenzhen, China, six (3.2%) of 92 COVID-19 patients hospitalized were cases with viral coinfections [27] . Another study conducted in Wuhan, China, reported that, among patients with COVID-19 (N \ufffd 104), 5.8% (N \ufffd 6) had coinfections with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses (2.9%, N \ufffd 3), influenza A (2.9%, N \ufffd 3), and rhinovirus (1.9%, N \ufffd 2) [28] . In the study by Kim et al. [22] with patients in California, USA, 19.8% (N \ufffd 23) of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (N \ufffd 116) were positive for other respiratory pathogens. As the first report on coinfections with respiratory pathogens among COVID-19 patients in Korea, especially in those from the first outbreak in February 2020, 7.9% were found to have viral coinfections, which is a rate comparable with those of previous reports.",

First, the effects of coinfections on the treatment outcomes of COVID-19 patients are unknown. e study subjects were retrospectively enrolled during the COVID-19 screening process in the region of the first outbreak in Korea. us, the scope of this study was to investigate the coinfection rates of respiratory pathogens among patients with COVID-19 who were not hospitalized, but diagnosed as positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the screening process. Second, the results of the study cannot represent the coinfection rates in winter when respiratory pathogens such as influenza are dominant. e study subjects were enrolled only in February; therefore, it would be interesting to investigate the rates of coinfection with respiratory pathogens across the entire winter season, especially from November to March. ird, the commercial multiplex RT-PCR assays (Allplex TM Respiratory Panel 1, 2, and 3) that we employed were able to detect the subtypes found in Flu, RSV, PIV, and non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses as described in Materials and Methods but unable to distinguish the HRV subtypes (A, B, and C), which were previously included in a report by Kuypers et al. [30] . Finally, this study did not investigate coinfections in COVID-19 patients with either opportunistic pathogens such as Streptococcus and Actinomyces or fungi such as Aspergillus and Candida, as Chen et al. [10, 31] described. e broad range of coinfecting agents in COVID-19 patients should be investigated.",

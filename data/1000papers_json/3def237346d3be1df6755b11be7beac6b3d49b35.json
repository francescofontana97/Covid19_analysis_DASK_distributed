Recent studies have shown an association between baseline ventilation parameters (driving pressure or mechanical power) and outcomes for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Strategies focused on limiting these parameters have been proposed to further improve outcomes. However, it remains unknown whether driving pressure and mechanical power should be limited over the entire duration of mechanical ventilation and in all patients with acute respiratory failure. We aimed to estimate the association between exposure to different intensities of mechanical ventilation over time and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure.",

            "text": "Mechanical ventilation is provided to more than 20 million patients worldwide per year for the treatment of acute respiratory failure. 1 Different ventilation strategies have mainly been studied in patients with severe forms of acute respiratory failure-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In these patients, evidence from randomised controlled trials supports the limitation of tidal volumes and plateau airway pressures. 2 Nevertheless, mortality of patients with respiratory failure remains high, 3 and additional strategies have been sought to further mitigate the risks of mechanical ventilation and improve patient outcomes. 4 In observational studies, limiting driving pressure and mechanical power have been proposed as targets to reduce mortality. 5, 6 Driving pressure is the pressure applied by the ventilator to support the delivery of tidal volumes and represents the strain applied to the lung during each ventilatory cycle. 7 Mechanical power combines multiple ventilatory variables, including driving pressure, to estimate the amount of energy applied to the lungs during mechanical ventilation. 8 Previous studies focused on only the association between driving pressure during the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation and mortality. 5, 6 Moreover, findings from studies of driving pressure or mechanical power in patients with ARDS might not be generalisable to the broader population of patients with acute respiratory failure. 9 Furthermore, differences in baseline physiological profiles between survivors and non-survivors do not prove that a causal association exists between driving pressure or mechanical power and patient-relevant outcomes, such as mortality or length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. 10 Finally, it is unclear whether the strength of the association between the intensity of mechanical ventilation and outcome remains persistent over time, and whether there is a cumulative effect of exposure to higher intensity mechanical ventilation. Therefore, our primary objective was to estimate the effect of time-varying exposure to different intensities of mechanical ventilation (as measured either by dynamic driving pressure or mechanical power) on ICU mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure. We also examined whether the strength of the effect changed over time, whether the effect was more pronounced for patients with more severe acute respiratory failure, and whether there was a cumulative effect of exposure over time.",

Patients were followed up from the initiation of mechanical ventilation until death, ICU discharge, liberation from mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h, or 30 days in the ICU, whichever occurred first. Patients liberated from mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h or exceeding 30 days of staying in ICU were censored in the analyses.

In the joint model analysis, 1661 (21\u00b71%) of 7876 patients died within the first 30 days after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. After adjusting for age, APACHE III score, baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, and baseline pH, both the time-varying dynamic driving pressure (HR 1\u00b7064 per cm H 2 O, 95% CrI 1\u00b7057-1\u00b7071) and mechanical power (HR 1\u00b7060 per J/min, 95% CrI 1\u00b7053-1\u00b7066) were associated with an increased risk of death in ICU (appendix p 11). (C) Relative hazard of death in the ICU predicted on the basis of baseline ventilatory ratio, calculated as (measured minute ventilation \u00d7 measured PaCO 2 ) / (expected minute ventilation \u00d7 ideal PaCO 2 ). Expected minute ventilation is 100 \u00d7 predicted bodyweight in kg \u00d7 100 (mL/min). The unadjusted relationships between the two types of respiratory failure and ICU mortality were estimated using cause-specific Cox proportional hazard models. ICU=intensive care unit. PaO 2 =partial pressure of oxygen. FiO 2 =fraction of inspired oxygen. PaCO 2 =partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Three secondary analyses were done. First, we observed that the strength of the association between the intensity of mechanical ventilation (as measured by driving pressure and mechanical power) and ICU mortality was persistent across the entire duration of mechanical ventilation (figure 3C; appendix p 10). Second, the severity of acute respiratory failure moderated the effect of timevarying driving pressure, as reflected by an increase in the strength of association at lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio ( figure 3D; appendix p 10 ). Third, we measured a cumulative effect of exposure to potentially harmful intensities of mechanical ventilation (table 3 ). An increase in the hazard of death was associated with every additional day of exposure to either driving pressure of greater than or equal to 15 cm H 2 O (HR 1\u00b7049 per day, 95% CrI 1\u00b7023-1\u00b7076) or mechanical power greater than or equal to 17 J/min (HR 1\u00b7069 per day, 95% CrI 1\u00b7047-1\u00b7092). Likewise, a higher cumulative dose of potentially injurious intensity of mechanical ventilation was associated with an increased hazard of death for driving pressure (HR 1\u00b7004 per cm H 2 O \u00d7 days of exposure, 95% CrI 1\u00b7003-1\u00b7005) and mechanical power (HR 1\u00b7003 Figure 3 : Association between driving pressure and ICU mortality during mechanical ventilation (A) Unadjusted relationship between dynamic driving pressure at baseline and relative hazard of death in the ICU, estimated using a cause-specific Cox proportional hazard model (n=10 591 patients with available dynamic driving pressure at baseline).

Results of the analyses using datasets generated by MICE were similar to the complete case analyses. The patients excluded from the complete case analysis had lower APACHE scores, less severe acute respiratory failure (a moderator for the effect of driving pressure), and a better outcome (appendix p 15), which is reflected in marginally lower estimates for the effects of time-dependent driving pressure and mechanical power than in the complete case analysis (appendix p 19).",

Harmful effects of driving pressure (but not mechanical power) were modulated by the severity of acute respiratory failure, with a stronger association between driving pressure and mortality in patients with a lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio. Importantly, we observed a cumulative effect over time; every additional day of mechanical ventilation at potentially injurious levels (ie, driving pressure \u226515 cm H 2 O or mechanical power \u226517 J/min) was associated with an increased risk of death in the ICU.

Interestingly, half of our cohort exceeded a previously described threshold for injurious mechanical power (\u226517 J/min) at baseline. 6 This is probably partly related to the fact that mechanical power, in contrast to driving pressure, is currently not routinely calculated and measured in our patients, as is also true for most ICUs worldwide.",

The longitudinal association between higher driving pressure or mechanical power and increased ICU mortality lends support to the notion of a causal relationship between driving pressure, mechanical power, and mortality. Therefore, these findings should be regarded as hypothesis-generating and further studies are needed to examine whether sustained interventions (ie, the initiation of extracorporeal life support) should be considered early, to avoid additional exposure to potentially harmful levels of driving pressure and mechanical power.",

            "text": "On the basis of our findings, clinicians could consider driving pressure and mechanical power as targets to guide mechanical ventilation in all patients with acute respiratory failure. This is of considerable importance because patients with ARDS only represent a small subgroup of the large population of patients with acute respiratory failure. In addition, ARDS is frequently under-recognised and, therefore, often inappropriately treated. 3 It could be argued that our findings are driven solely by a strong beneficial effect in patients with ARDS. However, we think that this is unlikely because of the low prevalence of ARDS in our cohort and the strength of the observed effect. Our findings are relevant to all patients with acute respiratory failure, regardless of the diagnosis. Finally, the severity of hypoxaemic respiratory failure modulated the effect of driving pressure on ICU mortality, which might explain why heterogeneous results have previously been described for the effects of driving pressure in patients without ARDS. [22] [23] [24] Our study has several important limitations. On the basis of our findings, we suggest a causal relationship between time-varying intensity of mechanical ventilation and ICU mortality. The shared parameter joint models used in our studies have the assumption that all interdependencies between the longitudinal covariates and the time-to-event outcome are explained by latent, subject-specific random effects, after adjustment for baseline covariates. This is a strong assumption that also implies that all of the baseline covariates are measured without error, with no residual confounding, and a correctly specified random effect and slope. If these assumptions are true, the observed estimates are probably independent of disease severity and other ventilator settings (such as tidal volumes, peak inspiratory pressure, or positive end-expiratory pressure) changing over time, and conditional exchangeability is provided. The clear dose-effect relationship between the intensity of mechanical ventilation and the outcome observed in our study provides added support for a causal relationship. Finally, our results were consistent with a causal mediation analysis showing that baseline driving pressure was a key ventilatory variable associated with mortality in patients with ARDS. 5 Nonetheless, a ventilation strategy limiting driving pressure or mechanical power would ultimately need evaluation in clinical trials. However, a clinical trial to show a significant difference in mortality of about 2-5% would require the inclusion of 5000-11 000 patients. A second limitation is that harmful stress and subsequent lung injury are caused by transpulmonary driving pressure (the pressure in the alveoli), but we only had measurements of static or dynamic airway driving pressure. Similar to other cohorts of mechanically ventilated patients, 3,6,25 static measurements of plateau pressure were available in only a minority of patients. Airway driving pressure does correlate with trans pulmonary driving pressure, but it represents only a surrogate, which might be affected by numerous factors (eg, resistive pressures, chest wall compliance, and spontaneous breathing). 26, 27 Third, our study included all patients who received mechanical ventilation, which makes the results generalisable. Consequently, significant heterogeneity might exist between diagnostic groups that is not detected in our analysis. Finally, the iCORE registry, like all databases with routinely collected data, comprises records with missing values. However, joint models are particularly robust when analysing datasets with missing data. 28 Moreover, the results from our primary analysis were robust in sensitivity analyses accounting for missing data using MICE.",

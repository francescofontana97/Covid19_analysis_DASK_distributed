The impact of pre-existing hypothyroidism on COVID-19 outcomes remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to identify a possible association between hypothyroidism and outcomes related to COVID-19 including hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation, and all-cause mortality. All patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in March 2020 in a large New York City health system were reviewed. Of the 3703 COVID-19 positive patients included in present study, 251 patients (6.8%) had pre-existing hypothyroidism and received thyroid hormone therapy. Hypothyroidism was not associated with increased risk of hospitalization [Adjusted Odds Ratio (OR adj ): 1.23 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.88-1.70)], mechanical ventilation [OR adj : 1.17 (95% CI: 0.81-1.69)] nor death [OR adj : 1.07 (95% CI: 0.75-1.54)]. This study provides insight into the role of hypothyroidism on the outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients, indicating that no additional precautions or consultations are needed. However, future research into the potential complications of COVID-19 on the thyroid gland and function is warranted.",

A one-to-three matching technique was utilized by matching one patient from the hypothyroidism group to three patients from the no hypothyroidism group based on their propensity score values, using the Greedy matching technique (10) . Event analysis for the outcome hospitalization was determined. Within the group of hospitalized patients, we again matched one patient from the hypothyroidism group to three patients from the no hypothyroidism group based on their propensity score values and ran event analysis for the outcome mechanical ventilation and all-cause mortality. We additionally performed time-toevent analysis for all-cause mortality. Patients with a survival time exceeding 50 days were censored to avoid a small number of patients at risk. The results of time-to-event analysis were expressed as a Kaplan-Meier curve with significance indicated using log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard model of all-cause mortality with robust sandwich variance estimates of standard errors was performed and expressed as hazard ratio.

The current recommendations by the ATA for patients with hypothyroidism are therefore accurate and no additional precautions are needed for patients suffering from hypothyroidism. From published literature, we know that well-managed hypothyroidism is not associated with increased infection risk although there is some evidence that susceptibility to infection might increase in patients with poorly controlled hypothyroidism (11, 12) . Therefore, the treatment of thyroid disorders in COVID-19 positive patients remains of significant importance amid the ongoing pandemic. The unprecedented strain on medical resources and implementation of social distancing measures pose a fundamental challenge to the treatment of patients with chronic conditions, including hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism requires management with thyroid hormone replacement therapy and active monitoring through regular biochemical testing to ensure that therapeutic levels are maintained (13) . Iatrogenic overtreatment with thyroid hormone supplementation is a known risk factor for the development of thyrotoxicosis (14) . A joint statement by the British Thyroid Association and the Society for Endocrinology (BTA/SfE) as well as the ATA regarding the COVID-19 pandemic therefore strongly advise that patients with thyroid disease continue taking their thyroid medications as prescribed in order to reduce any risk of thyroid dysregulation (15) that could lead to a more severe COVID-19 outcome.",

A limitation of this study includes that the study population consisted solely of patients within the New York metropolitan area therefore potentially limiting the generalizability of the results. Although assessing the outcomes of patients with hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's disease compared to patients with hypothyroidism due to other causes would be clinically relevant, a subgroup analysis was not feasible because of too low number of patients with Hashimoto's disease in our study cohort. The increased patient volume and reduced consultation time per patient associated with the increased influx of patients during the pandemic potentially resulted in missing data, especially for ambulatory patients, on certain covariates including race, BMI, and smoking status. Furthermore, we were unable to collect mortality data for the patients who were still hospitalized at the time of data collection, therefore potentially introducing bias. However, we estimate that little bias was introduced because only 1.3% of the study population was still hospitalized at the time of data collection.",

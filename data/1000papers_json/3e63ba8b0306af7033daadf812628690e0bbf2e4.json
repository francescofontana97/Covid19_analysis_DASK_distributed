We use a weighting scheme which considers the observed distinctiveness of sequences and apply it to calculations of linkage disequilibrium. Each sequence now contributes a weighted score to linkage disequilibrium measurements of pairwise loci. We demonstrate that this reduces the effect of uneven sampling, as underrepresented groups of sequences will each contribute more individually than redundant, similar sequences.",

To account for ambiguous bases there is an option to set --min-acgt fraction, which will throw out variable positions which contain below this fraction of A, C, G, or T. Also, there is a -min-minor argument, which ignores positions with a (dominant) minor fraction less than the specified value. We benchmarked the rust implementation compute time with default settings on an i7-8650U laptop with 32GB RAM. Sequence data were obtained from NCBI or the 1000 genomes project and aligned with MAFFT [11] [12] [13] .

To demonstrate this we generated an unbiased MSA containing two sets of 137 whole genome sequences of Hepatitis C subtype 1 of Japanese and USA origin. This alignment was unevenly sampled to create a second biased alignment of 25 Japanese and 137 USA sequences. With these two alignments we computed three sets of results using WeightedLD, 1) Unbiased-unweighted 2) Biased-unweighted and 3) Biased-Weighted. Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate that assigning weights to sequences results in higher contribution from the minor Japanese population, shifting LD pairwise calculations towards the values obtained with an unbiased set. The following results were calculated using parameters --min-acgt 0.9 --min-minor 0.02 --r2threshold 0.02. Within the figures the Wilcoxon test, Pearson correlation coefficients, and graphics were generated in R 14 . ",

The sustainable development goals have been hindered by COVID-19 severely [2] . Although it is understandable, and there is no doubt that profound influences have been created and observed in numerous aspects [3] , this study focuses on three important things-namely, healthcare, energy and environment-that are being coupled more closely than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. Facing the uncertainties caused by COVID-19 in the past 12 months, society is still on the way to understanding the impacts of the whole episode of the COVID-19 on healthcare, energy, environment and beyond. As mentioned in the famous proverb \"the blind men and the elephant\" [4] based on a Hindoo Fable (See Figure 1) , people contribute limited knowledge and experience to the understanding of an unfamiliar world. For the current situation, a more in-depth understanding is crucial based on group wisdom and prompt information sharing. current situation, a more in-depth understanding is crucial based on group wisdom and prompt information sharing.

Energy is key to healthcare services, which has played a fundamental role in the emergency response of the COVID-19 pandemic [6] . During the COVID-19 response, the energy insecurity and city environment have plagued primary healthcare systems, especially in the middle-and low-income countries [7] . Environmental factors have been broadly thought to be drivers for different infectious diseases, both in the land [8] and in the ocean [9] . Many epidemic and pandemic events were caused by the contact between environmental media and humans [10] , which constitutes a complex nexus between the natural environment and human society [11] . In addition, both the healthcare and energy sectors would cause adverse environmental effects. To this end, COVID-19 should not be an isolated public health incident, either in terms of its occurrence or from its impact perspective. Sound healthcare systems stressed the balance between the health of human beings and the disruptions of ecology that we engender [12] . The on-going COVID-19 demonstrated this relationship where any disruption of the human-ecological balance implicates human health [12] . Energy and environment are changing the vulnerability of healthcare to disease prevention, including COVID-19, other infectious diseases and noncommunicable diseases. For example, severe air pollution was found to be linked with higher mortality of patients when infected by the coronavirus [13] . Indoor air quality which causes respiratory issues has become an issue during the lockdown, relating to the ventilation and intensive use of cleaning products [14] . Unequal access to environmental and sanitation resources varied the capability to perform preventative measures. There are also studies suggested that the COVID-19 outbreak stems from environmental degradation, related to the exploitation of natural resources, emerging from the infectious diseases of zoonotic origin [15] . The relationship is not one-way, but a network or coupling system. COVID-19 that is viewed as the current healthcare emergency in most countries is also having indirect impacts on other diseases (e.g., treatment priority), energy consumption (e.g., caused by prevention strategies), and environmental footprint (e.g., changed by resources consumption).

Public Health 2021, 18, x 3 of 22 COVID-19 challenged healthcare systems, changed population lifestyles, reshaped energy consumption and living environment in society, and further triggered a series of chain reactions in the healthcare-energy-environment system. Various observations and quick lessons were published, via the fast track, to highlight the local impact on a single region or single sector, e.g., the healthcare impact in Latin America [16] and India [17] , the short-run impact on the electricity sector in the United States (US) [18] , the energy grid dynamics in Europe [19] , the impact on air quality in Brazil [20] , and the assessment of the impact on the environment in China [21] . Although the aforementioned studies did not pay attention to broader situations, they did contribute to understanding the specific impacts of COVID-19, which lay the foundation for further systematic integration. Other relevant studies are overviewed and discussed in Section 2 to Section 4. The more recent overview papers focused on multiple sectors independently. Mentioning at least a few: Ero\u011flu [22] discussed the COVID-19 effects on the environment and renewable energy separately. Chakraborty and Maity [23] briefly described the COVID-19 impact on the global environment and the society in terms of economy and health. Gillingham et al. [24] made a commentary on both the short-term and long-term effects on energy and the environment. Nicola et al. [3] summarised the COVID-19 impacts on different socio-economic sectors respectively, including the petroleum and oil, agriculture, manufacturing, education, finance, healthcare, tourism and food sectors. Mofijur et al. [25] offered an overview of the COVID-19 impacts on energy, environment and socio-economic sectors separately. Elavarasan and Pugazhendhi [26] discussed the changes in healthcare, public, government, energy, environment and industries in a parallel manner. However, in the current phase, the holistic and coupling impacts that focus on cross-sections have been rarely investigated. In addition, most of the existing observations are somewhat inconsistent across communities, countries and regions, which not only cannot fully describe the impacts, drivers and complexity of the COVID-19 pandemic but which disorient public opinion on the impacts [27] . As COVID-19 has been developing, and now even escalating fast, the previous overviews and reviews are becoming outdated very fast. There are always different angles of view and various observations, as implied by the parable of the blind men and the elephant in Figure 1 .

During COVID-19, severe outbreaks of dengue fever were observed in South and South-East Asia [45] and Latin America [48] where a huge part of the world population lives. Before mid-August 2020, the annual dengue incidence reached historical records in Paraguay [49] and Singapore [50] . There is quantitative evidence implying the potential relationship between the lockdown and the excessive number of dengue cases. During the two-month lockdown period in Singapore, compared to the previous two months, \"a five-fold increase in the incidence of Aedes mosquito larvae detected in homes and common corridors in residential areas\" [51] . Regarding the excessive number of dengue cases in 2020, there is another possibility that more dengue fever patients with mild symptoms were tested due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The primary care providers were suggested to test patients with fever even without a clear COVID-19 source and make sure earlier identification [52] , partially since COVID-19 and dengue fever present similar laboratory and clinical features [53] . The impacts of lockdown and resulting impacts on the dengue infection and control needs more investigation based on big urban data of the dengue transmission dynamics and the pattern changes of population mobility. Another interesting evidence showed less COVID-19 transmission and infection were observed in highly dengue-endemic countries, including India, Bangladesh, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Sudan [54] , which was later enhanced by the new data from Brazil [55] . However, such observation seemed not to be confirmed by the Singapore case. Spatial-temporal data analytics are important to draw or update a conclusion about such public health issues to avoid bias or misleading. In addition, other underlying common factors that may influence both the COVID-19 and dengue transmission deserve further investigation from a causality perspective rather than a relationship perspective to promote an in-depth understanding.",

Typical cities and countries include New York, NY, USA [56] , Singapore [57] , Japan, Qatar and several countries in the southern hemisphere [46] . However, there is another possibility that patients with flu would rather (or have to) stay at home since COVID-19 has overwhelmed the medical systems [46] . The next flu season is approaching in the northern hemisphere. It is better not to take the mildness of flu as for granted, let alone many countries have lifted lockdowns to recover the economy, and some people have been tired of wearing masks and even angered of staying-at-home [58] . Similar concerns have been reported for other infectious diseases, e.g., tuberculosis. During the pandemic, a drop in the number of tuberculosis patients visiting hospitals or clinics has been reported by at least 121 countries [59] . Lockdowns and the resulting disruptions in supply chains and medical services hindered the progress of about 80% of tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malaria programs [59] . The projection data indicated that an additional 6.3 million cases and 1.4 million global deaths in the next five years could be caused by a worst-case situation of global lockdowns [60] . This could be regarded as potential energy and environmental footprints due to lockdown measures. Prioritising COVID-19 and its healthcare over energy and environment is somewhat understandable during the crisis. However, it is not so rational to always prioritise COVID-19 over other infectious diseases. More studies on identifying the optimal prioritising of diseases treatment, e.g., by little's law [61] , at different phases of the pandemic, are important to prevent the overlook of other pressing health issues.",

Patients with non-communicable diseases, especially chronic diseases, have been enduring great pressures from the inconvenience of medical treatment and the higher risk of death after potential coronavirus infection. For example, patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes are at risk of severe COVID-19 and generally have worse outcomes [65] . Elective medical services have also been cancelled around the world in combating COVID-19 [66] . In addition to physical health, another particular impact is that on mental health, especially to those with chronic diseases. The problem is brewing currently in all societies [67] , and it will only get worse unless proactive recognition and offer of support are provided by the healthcare systems and governments. By the online survey, 80% of the healthcare professionals claimed deteriorating mental health of their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic [29] .",

Those have been the case non-communicable diseases mainly; however, COVID-19 understandably highlighted the importance [68] and boosted their rapid development [69] to reduce face-to-face contacts [29] via virtual healthcare, mobile devices, smart apps and digital technologies. Telemedicine and ehealthcare can be as very beneficial solutions during the COVID-19 period [5] . However, there are still pitfalls to deal with [70] , e.g., medico-legal issues, in telemedicine consultation, which required further improvement and adaption. For COVID-19 fighting with digital technology, Ting et al. [71] summarised the related technologies, including the artificial intelligence (AI) which employs machine learning, big-data analytics, blockchain platform technology [72] and Internet of Things (IoT) with advanced telecommunication technology, e.g., 5G and even 6G. The development of telemedicine, e-healthcare and healthcare robotics has been promising [73] . A compound annual growth rate of over 33% has been expected in the global remote healthcare market from years 2019 to 2025 [74] . However, the online services and smart monitoring are generally less accessible for some populations, including the patients who live in low-and middle-income countries [75] , the older patients with lower socio-economic status and less education, and even some patients without insurance coverage for telemedicine [76] . It requires substantial work to reach these individuals and eliminate payment barriers so that healthcare with digital technology can cover all of the target populations.",

            "text": "Another aspect that it is easy to overlook lies in energy and environmental footprints of telemedicine and e-healthcare. The chronic disease management in the data era is a multidisciplinary systems science, which connects people, data, devices and multiple systems [77] . In the year 2019, the global real-time virtual healthcare took over 46% of the overall e-healthcare market [74] . Massive data samples are needed to discover hidden patterns and even recommend better solutions [78] , for which personal real-time monitoring is a general pathway [79] . Although telemedicine and e-healthcare would reduce the travelling of patients, the real-time monitoring, operations of smart devices, data storage, big-data analytics by AI consumed massive energy and produced unexpected air emissions. For example, the AI model training would produce the carbon emissions equivalent of five times that by the American cars [80] . The information and communication technology (ICT) sector produces 2% of the global carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions [81] . All digital technologies rely on data centres, and the energy-use related to only data centres accounted for~1% of global electricity use [82] . During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, it requires more comprehensive assessments about the potential impacts of telemedicine and e-healthcare on energy consumption and GHG emissions, rather than just the assessment of the travelling-distance reduction [83] and its resulting benefits for global emissions. In addition, the monitoring quality and warning mechanism need to be improved to avoid unnecessary healthcare visits. For example, the abnormal pulse feature of Apple Watch would lead to excessive use of limited healthcare resources [84] and therefore increase energy and environmental footprints. The improvements in terms of AI algorithms and energy efficiency have the potential to reduce electricity consumption for long-term monitoring and data analytics [85] . Practitioners have been recently trying the energy-efficient IoT-health monitoring system [86] and the energy-efficient and secure framework based on Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) [87] .",

            "text": "COVID-19 had also changed people's social and economic activity patterns which had been reflected in products consumption and purchase [88] , and energy consumption [89] . After implementing lockdowns in worldwide cities, the global energy demand and consumption dropped significantly, and apparent structural changes were observed. Although renewable energy demand is relatively stable, mainstream fossil energy demand drops [90] . The residential demand increases, but industrial and commercial demands drop [91] . According to the data from the International Energy Agency, the year-on-year demand growth rates of global oil, coal, gas, nuclear and renewables in 2020 compared with 2019 were estimated as -9.12, -7.73, -4.99, -2.52 and 0.79% [92] . The residential energy demand increases, but the industrial and commercial energy demands decline sharply due to the shutdowns [24] . For example, electricity consumption declined by <10%, whilst the consumptions of gasoline and jet fuel were reduced by 30 and 50% in the US [24] . In the energy sector, too much attention has been paid on declined energy consumption. The extra energy consumption for COVID-19 fighting in the healthcare sector has been considered as a major issue. The actual decline of energy consumption was partly offset by extra energy consumption for COVID-19 fighting and was really declining during the spread-out lockdown. Kleme\u0161 et al. [37] appealed to focus more on the extra energy footprints and extra environmental footprints of those fighting measures during COVID-19, e.g., personal protective equipment, disinfection and supply chains even if energy and environmental issues understandably receive relatively lower priorities compared with healthcare issues in the critical situation. In addition, the potential rebound effect in overall energy consumption of digitalisation and IoT, which was expected to be significantly stimulated by COVID-19 crisis, needs to be further assessed. Most of the studies suggested that it is rather optimistic that digitalisation could lead to lower energy consumption. IoT and AI could lead to higher energy efficiency; however, the increase in the energy usage of IoT and AI could outweigh the positive impacts [93] .",

However, the energy sector also provides electricity support for environmental management. In the opposite direction, the environmental sector offers resources for the energy sector, which constitutes a natural nexus between them. The COVID-19 has navigated the transitions of renewable and sustainable energy [95] and clean energy, including nuclear energy [96] . According to data from 123 countries over 25 years, Sovacool et al. [97] found that, compared to renewables, nationwide nuclear attachments do not necessarily associate with lower carbon emissions significantly. More attention and personalised assessment, with a consideration of the environment in different countries, are urgently required to navigate the energy transitions under the COVID-19 pandemic.",

A temporary reduction in GHG emissions had been reported consecutively in worldwide cities during the period of implementing lockdowns. The spatial heterogeneity of the reduction rate of CO 2 emissions in the first half-year of 2020 was calculated by Liu et al. [106] , Spain (\u221218.8%), India (\u221215.4%), Germany (\u221215.1%), the United Kingdom (UK) (\u221215.0%), France (\u221214.2%), Italy (\u221213.7%), the US (\u221213.3%), Brazil (\u221212.0%), Japan (\u22127.5%), Russia (\u22125.3%) and China (\u22123.7%). In addition to the heterogeneity on the country scale, data from the 28 air quality stations in the US indicated that the reductions in nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) ranged 5 to 49% [107] , and different mechanisms on temperature, air pollution and COVID-19 cases have been identified by regional divisions based on the 219 prefecture cities in China [108] . On 9 September 2020, the United in Science 2020 Report showed that GHG concentrations continue to climb and have been at record levels in the atmosphere following a temporary decline because of COVID-19 [109] . With the recovery of population and economic activities, the long-run GHG emissions are still hard to estimate. For example, stimulus packages and actions taken by governments might lead to the dual growth of the economy and GHG emissions in the coming years [110] . Even in the short term, the situations are not necessarily all positive. Although sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and NO 2 were recorded at the lowest levels amongst the past six years during the lockdown period, extreme particulate matter concentrations were observed unexpectedly in northern China due to the synergy of multiple factors, including the stagnant airflow, the anomalously high humidity, the uninterrupted emissions from petrochemical facilities and power plants, and the alleviated titration effect during the lockdown [111] .",

            "text": "Significant structural changes in the solid waste generation were also observed apparently. Just in China, the production of face masks with plastic components increased to 116 million/d in February 2020, being equivalent to 12 times the amount in the previous month [115] . The massive usage of plastic in personal protective equipment boosts medical waste drastically, e.g., a whopping increase of 370% in Hubei, China [89] and 350% in Catalonia, Spain [116] . The lifestyle changes and the cost incentive of plastic production increase the overall plastic demand and the resulting plastic waste [117] . For example, a 40% increase in plastics demand has been expected in Spain, and a 15% elevation of plastic waste demand has been recorded in Thailand [116] . Plastic waste elevated from 1500 to 6300 t/d in Thailand at the peak time [118] owing to food deliveries to homes. What makes the situation worse lies in the destroyed plastic recycling programmes. For instance, over 40% of plastic recycling companies in South and Southeast Asia were at risk of bankruptcy due to the COVID-19 pandemic [119] . Figure 3 shows the spatial difference of the change rate of solid waste generation caused by COVID-19. Compared to medical waste and plastic waste, household waste has presented more complicated changes, e.g., a 28% reduction in Milan, Italy, and a 17% fall in Catalonia, Spain [116] , a 25% reduction in Barcelona, Spain [120] , a 15% fall in Campinas-SP, Brazil [121] , a 23% decrease in Shanghai, China [122] , and a 30% reduction in major cities of China [89] . However, due to the geographical, sociological and cultural factors, some cities present converse trends, e.g., a 1% elevation in Brno, Czech Republic [122] , a 3% increase in Singapore [123] , a 4.2% climbing in New York, US [124] , a 12 to 15% increase in residential garbage in some municipalities of Ontario, Canada [125] , and a 35% bloom in Sydney, Australia [126] . Some towns observed 20 to 40% more waste during the lockdown period in Singapore [127] . Waste in residential areas had spiked by as much as 40% in some cities in the US [128] . The household waste generation in Nigeria, Africa was roughly estimated to increase by 77% based on the questionnaires [129] . Systems thinking [130] and diversified solutions are needed for different regions and countries, and for different types of waste. It is notable that double whammies have been caused by the variation in solid waste generation. On the one hand, the treatment capacity in some densely populated cities would be the limitations for those sharply increased medical waste [89] . For example, over 35% of medical waste was not treated properly in Brazil [121] . Mismanagement of excess waste could result in increased environmental pollution [131] and even health risks due to medical waste pollution. On the other hand, although zero-waste under a Circular Economy paradigm would be a long-run trend, sharply varied amount of municipal waste might destroy the sustainability of operations of the incineration facilities in the waste-to-energy systems. Worldwide best practices during COVID-19 would be beneficial for emergency and disaster waste management.",

Systems thinking [130] and diversified solutions are needed for different regions and countries, and for different types of waste. It is notable that double whammies have been caused by the variation in solid waste generation. On the one hand, the treatment capacity in some densely populated cities would be the limitations for those sharply increased medical waste [89] . For example, over 35% of medical waste was not treated properly in Brazil [121] . Mismanagement of excess waste could result in increased environmental pollution [131] and even health risks due to medical waste pollution. On the other hand, although zero-waste under a Circular Economy paradigm would be a long-run trend, sharply varied amount of municipal waste might destroy the sustainability of operations of the incineration facilities in the waste-to-energy systems. Worldwide best practices during COVID-19 would be beneficial for emergency and disaster waste management. In addition to the variation in waste generation, the behaviour changes in recycling and illegal waste dumping may bring long-term impacts on waste management. Recycling programmes might be hindered by several reasons, such as the resource shortage and the high risk of manual waste segregation during pandemics. For example, the government authority recommended the suspension of such programmes in Brazil due to the potentially high risks in recycling centres [121] . The medium-or long-term effects of the suspension of recycling programmes deserve concerns [132] . However, compared to the Brazil case, waste recycling also presents geographic differences. For example, the waste recycling rate in Milan, Italy, was increased by 1% compared with the same period in 2019 [120] . Shanghai is another positive example. Although the absolute volumes of household waste and recyclables were reduced, the recycling rate had no significant variation in Shanghai [133] , where waste segregation at the source was implemented [134] . The lesson learned from the COVID-19 could (i) boost the automation-enhanced waste segregation using intelligent robotics [135] , and AI technologies [136] and (ii) promote the sorting at the source [134] rather than at the end. During the COVID-19 pandemic, illegal waste dumping, including the face masks, was broadly observed in Brazil [121] , the UK [137] and Romania [138] . For example, a 300% rise in illegal waste disposal was observed during the lockdown in the UK [137] , and a 70% increase was reported in Melbourne, Australia in April 2020 [126] .

As illustrated in Figure 4 , the solid arrows suggest the direct relationships amongst the healthcare, energy and environment. Healthcare would cause environmental impacts and act as the driving factor for improving energy efficiency. The environment provides resources and waste to generate energy and acts as the driving factor for health issues in the healthcare sector. The energy sector provides necessary energy and electricity support to the healthcare and environment sectors and causes adverse environmental impacts as well. The dashed arrows in Figure 4 imply that healthcare, energy and environment trigger climate change that has been one of rethinking focuses during and after COVID-19 [143] . The fossil energy usage, air emissions, waste treatment by incineration, and healthcare with energy support and environmental impacts are all driving factors for climate change. Reversely, the proper regulations on climate change offer constraints to force the transitions of the healthcare, energy and environment management, e.g., the IoMT-based energy-efficient e-healthcare [87] , the sustainable waste management under Circular Economy [144] and the transitions of clean and renewable energy [145] .

For example, the estimated deaths in New York City during the COVID-19 is more than 1918 influenza pandemics [158] . It is hard to imagine what would happen if the global COVID-19 pandemic had happened before. Although the world was at the atmosphere of panic, sadness, anger and anxiety due to COVID-19 [58] , the new day's sun has been rising, gratifying that we are already in the advancing stage of an era of digitalisation. There are many digital solutions for many problems, such as e-tracking for COVID-19 [62] , telemedicine [69] , e-healthcare [87] , e-learning [159] , e-office [160] and e-shopping [161] . As discussed in Section 2 to Section 4, the digitalisation and ICT, with proper support from design, production and manufacturing, have the potential to play the crucial role in coping with the pandemics, sustainable environment management and energy efficiency improvement. However, without proper design, the digitalisation is not necessarily a driver for sustainability [162] . Although the comprehensive assessment of the rebound effects of digitalisation and ICT is challenging [163] , the energy cost [164] , the environmental effect [163] and climate footprint [165] of digitalisation and ICT should not be neglected. Based on the proposed healthcare-energy-environment nexus, the future development framework of a climate footprint-focused digitalisation would be expected. More definitions and explanations of footprint analysis are referred to as\u010cu\u010dek et al. [166] . For such a potential framework, the climate change emergency [167] , the Circular Economy strategies [168] and the transitions to renewable and sustainable energy [95] would make contributions from different perspectives. Beyond fundamental technical solutions, operational optimisation [169] and global collaboration and data sharing [170] have always been being pursued.",

First, the healthcare-energy-environment nexus deserves more in-depth investigation in striking the right balance between the welfare of human beings (healthcare and energy) and planet (the environment), in other words, planetary health. Second, more quantitative assessments are also needed for the cross-sections of the three sectors, such as the energy footprints in the healthcare sector and the quantitative assessment of GHG emissions under the nexus thinking for healthcare, energy and environment. Third, multiple sectors, e.g., economy and ecology, might be incorporated into the current healthcareenergy-environment nexus to provide more insights. Fourth, COVID-19 has created many opportunities regarding large-scale natural or behavioural experiments for research. For example, a rapid learning experiment regarding effective strategies for climate change [172] . More studies in the healthcare, energy and environment sectors may focus on the lessons and structural changes related to COVID-19 [173] . Fifth, the strength of this review paper is the comprehensive discussion on the structural changes and spatial heterogeneity, while the possible limitation lies in the lack of enough critical comments for some of the findings and related reasons. The limitation could be addressed in the future when the knowledge on the impacts of COVID-19 is getting mature. ",

Whereas women often access testing around childbirth, men access health care (including HIV testing) more rarely and as a consequence are diagnosed later in HIV disease [3, 4] . HIV-infected men are also less likely to link to care than women. [5] Both the male testing and linkage to care \"gaps\" pose a challenge for the implementation of combination HIV prevention strategies, including treatment as prevention (TasP). Identifying interventions to increase HIV testing among men -particularly those engaged in high-risk behaviors -is thus an HIV prevention priority.",

However, most incentivebased approaches have not utilized key insights from behavioral economics, missing an important opportunity to develop interventions that are more effective and less expensive. One insight is that lottery-based incentives may be more effective than small, fixed incentives [8] [9] [10] . Importantly, lottery-based incentives may be most appealing to men with risk-seeking preferences, making this intervention particularly well suited for promoting HIV testing among high-risk men. A second insight is that because individuals display \"loss aversion\" -a strong reluctance to lose something they already own [8, 11] -framing incentives as items to be lost if one does not get tested can be more effective than framing them as items to be won if one gets tested.",

About 3,000 men will be randomized to interventions that encourage them to get HIV tested in their communities. In Aim 2, we will study the efficacy of financial incentives for promoting initiation of and facilitating maintenance of antiretroviral therapy (as measured by HIV virologic suppression) among HIV-infected persons identified during a community-based HIV testing campaign. About 400 men and women with HIV will be randomized to receive financial incentives for achieving (or maintaining) an undetectable HIV viral load vs. no incentives (standard of care). In Aim 3, we will assess loss aversion strategies for promoting retesting for HIV among high-risk individuals: this aim will first be developed through a pilot study, and then refined for the larger comparative trial. Finally, Aim 4 will explore the sustainability of incentives by examining the effect of one-time incentives on future HIV testing behavior. Aim 4 will also assess the cost-effectiveness of incentives, compared with each other. Qualitative research will be integrated into most Aims. Table 1 provides an overview: [2, 12] . Men are also less likely to have recently tested and more likely to be unaware of their HIV infection [13] . The impact of this can be seen throughout the HIV care cascade, as HIV-infected men are less likely to link to care, enter care with more advanced disease, are less likely to receive antiretroviral therapy (ART), and have higher mortality than HIV-infected women [3, 4, [14] [15] [16] .",

            "text": "Economic theories of decision making provide a strong rationale for using small economic incentives to promote healthy behaviors. Incentives can reduce the \"price\" of a behavior and increase demand for it. Behavioral economics provides an added rationale; with insights from psychology and economics, it points to decision making biases stemming from two types of time preferences: a) \"present-bias\" -the placement of disproportionate weight on present vs. future costs and benefits [17, 18] , and b) \"temporal discounting\" --the discounting of future costs and benefits. Thus, even with large benefits to adopting a behavior, individuals may fail to do so if its benefits are delayed and its costs (economic or psychological) are immediate. This implies that individuals can be \"nudged\" towards healthy behavior with incentives that offer an immediate benefit [7, 10, 19] . Incentive-based interventions have proven to be acceptable in many settings and found to have minimal risk of coercion. For example, cash and in-kind incentives have modified health behaviors ranging from vaccination uptake, smoking cessation, to HTC [7, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] ; they have even been widely used by governments [25, 26] . Our studies in east Africa show that small, fixed incentives are effective in partially modifying men's HIV behaviors, such as circumcision and HTC uptake [27, 28] . We have also undertaken qualitative studies to assess the ethics and acceptability of incentives in east Africa [29] .",

The benefits of testing, on the other hand, are more in the future and include the prospect of ART if one tests HIV positive. Incentives are ideal in this case because they create immediate benefits to testing and even offset some immediate costs. However, the standard approach of offering fixed incentives does not fully achieve desired behaviors and fails to realize the entire potential of incentives by not incorporating ideas from behavioral economics. For some, small incentives may be overlooked due to the \"peanuts effect\" (rewards may be \"small peanuts\", not worth the effort) [9] , a phenomenon supported by our pilot data [28] . Behavioral economics suggests novel approaches that may be more effective, and less costly.",

In seminal research, Kahneman and Tversky's Prospect Theory showed that people place a greater decision weight on probabilities near zero [8] . Thus lotteries with low probabilities of winning large prizes may be more appealing than a fixed incentive that is equal in its mathematical expected value. Lottery-based incentives may also be more effective because people tend to pay considerable attention to the magnitude of rewards [8, 34] . The anticipated emotion of winning a prize can be influential in driving behavior [34] . Lottery-based incentives may be ideal for implementing targeted testing and promoting HIV testing among higher risk men. Economists have shown that individuals' risk preferences (i.e. attitudes towards risk) are an important predictor of their interest in lotteries [35, 36] , with individuals displaying \"risk seeking\" preferences having the most interest. Such preferences have been associated with health behaviors such as use of preventive medical care and cigarette smoking [37] [38] [39] . The men in our study who find lottery-based incentives most appealing may be those with risk seeking preferences, a group likely to include HIV-infected persons and those engaged in high risk behaviors.",

            "text": "Loss aversion is a prominent feature of human decision-making behavior that, if properly incorporated into the design of incentive-based interventions, can successfully promote HIV testing. Another central insight from behavioral economics is that individuals display \"loss aversion\" in their decision making; they have an implicit mental accounting system in which gaining something is less motivating than losing something of similar value [8, 11, 40] . While loss aversion has been put into practice for some behaviors in high-and middleincome countries by way of \"commitment contracts\" in which people commit their own money in advance and agree to forgo the money if they fail to undertake a behavior or achieve a target outcome [41] , it has not been attempted in low-income countries due to obvious ethical and practical obstacles to imposing penalties on people living in poverty. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a novel loss aversion intervention in which a sense of ownership is generated for an incentive in advance of HIV testing, and participants are informed they will \"lose\" their reward if they do not HIV test. Our solution relies on the theory that people are sensitive to potential rewards being framed as gains or losses [40, 42, 43] . Just as Rothman, Salovey and others have applied this theory in studies of framing health communication [44, 45] , framing incentives as losses can be effective [46] . We will also test the \"commitment contract\" (or \"deposit contract\") interventions as these have shown promise in some studies. Assessing whether it is possible to apply the principle of loss aversion and develop interventions that can better motivate individuals to test for HIV is a central motivation of Aim 1 and the Aim 3 pilot.",

[49, 50] In addition to promoting HIV testing in persons who have not previously HIV tested, incentives may be effective in promoting longitudinal, repeat HIV testing in people who test HIV antibody negative but remain at high-risk for HIV infection. However, whether incentives are needed to promote repeat HIV testing in high-risk groups, and if so, what type of incentive approach is most likely to be effective remains unknown.

The primary outcome will be HIV testing uptake after randomization. Our hypothesis is that lottery and loss aversion incentives will result in significantly higher testing uptake than fixed incentives. We also hypothesize that the proportion of testers in each arm who are HIV-infected (secondary outcome) will be highest with lottery-based incentives.

Determine whether HIV-infected men and women are more likely to achieve and maintain HIV virologic suppression if offered financial incentives vs. no incentives (standard of care).

We hypothesize that a financial incentive will be more effective than no incentive in promoting HIV virologic suppression (a measure of success in ART adherence and navigation of the HIV treatment cascade) because incentives capitalize on present bias by drawing attention to a salient, immediate benefit of initiating and/or maintaining treatment, and leverage loss aversion by generating implicit loss as a result of delaying the decision to initiate ART. By incentivizing adults who have just obtained an HIV-positive result to achieve virologic suppression over the next 6 months, the intervention incentivizes multiple behaviors including prompt linkage to care, initiation of ART, and adherence to ART.",

We will compare these two types of incentive strategies to a no incentive arm as well.

The probabilities of winning prizes will vary from about 1-5%, with higher value prizes having lower probability. Our pilot data from the SEARCH Trial indicate that lottery-based rewards are feasible and acceptable in communities. Implementation: After HIV testing and counseling is complete, participants will be given a scratch card or sealed envelope that will reveal if they won a prize (we have used scratch cards in our studies in Kenya previously, and they are also widely used in Uganda). Prizes will be given to participants at the time their scratch card reveals they have won. The exact list of prizes will be determined after further consultation in study communities in year 1.",

Participants will be randomized to whether they see a specific prize or multiple prizes. The rationale for the latter strategy is that by actively choosing a prize, participants may form a greater attachment to it and may be more likely to come for HIV testing. Staff will then spend the duration of the visit generating a sense of familiarity with the prize for the participant. Methods for generating a sense of familiarity will be developed based on experiences theorized to explain the emergence of psychological ownership [52] , and after further pilot testing and consultation with community advisory boards in study communities in year 1. Staff will emphasize that men will not receive the prize if they do not participate in HIV testing and that their prize will be returned to them if they get tested. In this way, the incentive is framed as a loss rather than a gain, thereby leveraging loss aversion while not requiring men in very low-income settings to experience an actual loss [40, 42] .",

In accordance with principles of Grounded Theory [55] , we will iteratively collect and rapidly analyze interview transcript data, continuing to randomly select participants within theoretically-informed categories (e.g. not only study group but categories such as age group or marital status) until the data attain theoretical saturation. Based on our prior qualitative research in the setting, we anticipate that each study group data will attain saturation with N=10-20 men who opted to test, and N=10-20 men who did not (N=about 100 total). The interview guide will be designed to elicit responses to two thematic areas: i) men's perceptions, attitudes, and preferences related to the incentives offered; and ii) men's other motivations and barriers related to testing, including qualitative exploration of risk preferences, other psychosocial factors (e.g. fatalism, avoidant coping style, internalized stigma, and perceived masculine gender norms counter to health-seeking behaviors) and contextual factors (e.g. livelihood strategies that interact with responses to incentives and testing). Trained interviewers will pursue lines of questioning following the domains of inquiry outlined above, while allowing participants to discuss salient subjects.

In these subsequent time periods, incentives offered for HTC will either be significantly smaller or nonexistent, since the objective will be test the durability and sustainability of the effect of offering incentives for HTC initially.

(4) Repetition of analyses 1-3 incorporating the long-term (3 year) effects of incentives on testing (as assessed in this 3 rd Aim). If the proportion of participants testing at future HTC campaigns remains similar to the proportion who tested when incentives were offered, the increased yield of testing and HIV-infected individuals identified in those future years -with no added incentive cost -will result in more favorable cost-effectiveness ratios. (5) Cost implications of incentives given a community target testing level.

This will include modeled lifetime ART health benefits and costs. (4) Repetition of analyses 1-3 incorporating the long-term (3 year) effects of incentives on testing (as assessed in this 3rd Aim). If the proportion of participants testing at future HTC campaigns remains similar to the proportion who tested when incentives were offered, the increased yield of testing and HIV-infected individuals identified in those future years -with no added incentive cost -will result in more favorable cost-effectiveness ratios. (5) Cost implications of incentives given a community target testing level. Increased HTC uptake at mobile venues due to incentives (and thus decreased need for resource-intensive tracking and testing) could generate overall cost reductions for identifying persons unaware of their infection. The main outcome metric will be how many additional high-risk men can be tested by spending fixed resources on novel rather than standard incentives. These analyses will be conducted using customized spreadsheet-based decision tree and clinical progression simulation modeling methods adapted from our past projects. Extensive 1-way, multi-way, threshold, and scenario sensitivity analyses will quantify the effects of input uncertainty on results. Our analytic perspective will be the health system, for direct medical costs, discounting future costs and DALYs at 3% per year.",

However, the value of the fixed incentives as well as the expected value of the lottery-based incentives are low compared to certain costs of HIV testing such as transportation and opportunity costs. This means that most participants are unlikely to experience a significant economic gain as a result of getting tested or treated for HIV, thereby minimizing the risk of coercion. A recent publication by the Ethics Working Group of the HIV Prevention Trials Network has also made the case that the use of incentives for health promotion does not necessarily undermine individual autonomy [64] . Instead, the incentives can help overcome economic obstacles or motivational deficiencies; they can promote engagement in health-related behaviors that participants regard as beneficial or worthwhile, but do not undertake due to behavioral biases such as present-biased preferences. Our past experience implementing small economic incentive interventions in Kenya and Uganda has also demonstrated that such interventions are acceptable to both communities and ethical review boards [28, 65] .",

The risk of coercion is likely to be minimal in this case because the incentives are not so large in value that they substantially exceed the likely costs associated with HIV testing or treatment. Incentives of similar value have been used in a number of different contexts in resourcelimited settings to achieve changes in behaviors [27, 51, 66] , and we have previously received IRB approval for the use of such amounts.",

The clarified supernatant was then inactivated with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 0.4% (v/v) at 37 \u2022 C for 5 days. The inactivated supernatant was then tested for viral viability by infecting Vero E6 cells at a 10-fold serial dilution with DMEM from 10 \u22121 to 10 \u22125 , using live SARS-CoV-2 strain HK20 virus as a control. The cytopathic effect was checked daily, and the supernatant of each tissue culture well was collected on day 5, followed by the determination of the viral RNA copy number using the 2019 Novel Coronavirus RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The inactivated virus was then ultracentrifuged at 28,000\u00d7 g overnight at 4 \u2022 C. Subsequently, the supernatant was discarded, and the virion pellet was washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Gibco). The concentrated inactive virus was resuspended using 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG)-8000 (w/v; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) with 2.2% NaCl (w/v, Sigma Aldrich) and gently swirled at 4 \u2022 C overnight. The mixture was then centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7 g for 30 min and the PEG-precipitated virions were resuspended with ice-cold sterile PBS. Resuspended virions were then added to a 40-60% sucrose gradient (w/v in 0.22 \u00b5m filter-sterilized PBS) drop by drop, followed by ultracentrifugation at 28,000\u00d7 g for 2 h at 4 \u2022 C. The virion-containing fraction was then collected and washed by sterile PBS twice with ultracentrifugation at 28,000\u00d7 g for 2 h at 4 \u2022 C to remove any residual sucrose. Lastly, the virion pellet was resuspended in PBS and viral concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).",

Among these 61 samples, 35 were obtained within 7 days post-qRT-PCR confirmation, 12 were obtained after 7 days post-qRT-PCR confirmation, and 14 were undated. The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in these human serum samples was tested using the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kit (Euroimmun) following the manufacturer's protocol. The positive human serum sample from Panel 1 (HK59-D20) was not included here. The reactivity of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein with the mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein mAb clone #05 (Sino Biological) was determined by Western blotting, using the inactive SARS-CoV-2 virions purified as described above as a control. Briefly, 40 ng of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein and 1 \u00b5g of inactive SARS-CoV-2 virion were first subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under a reducing condition. Then, the proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-FL polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using the Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) under a voltage of 25 V for 40 min. The membrane was then blocked with 5% skimmed milk (Maxigenes, Dural, Australia; in PBST) at 4 \u2022 C overnight and subsequently incubated with 0.232 \u00b5g/mL of the mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein mAb at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with 0.3% PBST, the membrane was incubated with 1:4000 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (Invitrogen) in 0.3% PBST as a secondary antibody.

            "text": "A serodiagnosis for COVID-19 requires the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples of infected animals. In general, host-specific secondary antibodies are needed if an ELISA is to be used for the detection of the presence of antibodies in a particular kind of animal. However, secondary antibodies may not be readily available for all animal species. For example, in our past experience in detecting the influenza virus in a giant panda from a local amusement park in 2019 and examining its corresponding immune response [23] , we found that secondary antibodies against giant pandas were not commercially available. Therefore, the hemagglutinin inhibition test, instead of the more specific serological tests, had to be used. However, such non-specific serological tests only exist for a few types of infections. For other infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, for which non-specific serological tests are lacking, host-specific secondary antibodies would need to be generated. For instance, in our previous attempt to develop an ELISA-based serodiagnostic assay for aspergillosis in falcons (Falco spp.), we produced a polyclonal anti-falcon immunoglobulin Y (IgY) antibody by immunzing laboratory guinea pigs with purified falcon IgY, followed by guinea pig IgG purification and HRP labelling. This was because anti-falcon IgY antibodies were not available in the market [24] . In addition, for infections affecting multiple animal hosts, secondary antibodies against all animal species concerned would be necessary for their serodiagnosis. A high diagnostic cost would then be associated with the purchasing and/or generation of many different kinds of secondary antibodies for these infectious diseases. In order to solve these problems, the use of the cELISA would become a feasible approach since, instead of measuring the amount of serum antibodies from the animal hosts, the detection antibody in the cELISA recognizes the monoclonal antibody which competes with host serum antibodies for the coated antigen. Therefore, the cELISA system only measures the amount of monoclonal antibody bound and thus only one secondary antibody against the monoclonal antibody, generated from one single animal species, is required. As an illustration, we recently developed a cELISA for the serodiagnosis of glanders [25] , a highly communicable disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia mallei affecting a variety of animals [26] . Since a mouse monoclonal antibody is used in this assay, only a secondary antibody against mouse IgG is needed for antibody detection [25] . Similarly, in the present study, we developed a cELISA-based serological test which can serve to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies across many different animal species.",

            "text": "The recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein-based cELISA developed here is sensitive and specific for the serodiagnosis of COVID-19. The N proteins of CoVs are abundantly expressed during infection and are highly immunogenic [27] . They, along with the spike (S) proteins, are popular antigens used for serodiagnosis of CoV infections [27] . In our previous experience, when indirect ELISAs were developed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we observed that the SARS-CoV N protein-based IgG ELISA possessed a significantly higher sensitivity than the S protein-based IgG ELISA [28] . For SARS-CoV-2, a recent serological study using a luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay also suggested that measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein antibodies may be more sensitive than measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibodies for detecting early infection in humans [29] . For the present study, a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein was used as the coating antigen to develop a cELISA. This cELISA allows the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in animal sera through competition with a mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein mAb to interact with the coated antigen. Assessment of the analytical performance of this cELISA showed that it possessed a high analytical sensitivity, with limits of detection down to 1:64 and 1:256 as the last reactive dilutions of the positive human and guinea pig sera, respectively (Figure 6a ). The cELISA was also analytically specific (93.9% [95% C.I.: 87.2-100.6%]). In our previously developed recombinant N protein-based ELISA for SARS-CoV [30] , cross reactivity was observed between the recombinant SARS-CoV N protein and 14.3% of convalescent human patient serum samples, which were seropositive to human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43, species Betacoronavirus 1, subgenus Embecovirus) [31] . On the contrary, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein used in the cELISA developed in this study did not cross react with any serum sample seropositive to DcCoV UAE-HKU23 or RbCoV HKU14, both of which are also members of the subgenus Embecovirus (Figure 6b ). However, it was of note that in our experiment two out of the twelve MERS-CoV (subgenus Merbecovirus) seropositive dromedary sera, and one out of the seventeen Ro-BatCoV HKU9 (subgenus Nobecovirus) seropositive Leschenault's rousette sera still cross reacted (Figure 6b ). Preliminary assessment of the diagnostic performance of the cELISA showed that it could well distinguish serum samples from laboratory animals pre-and post-immunization with inactive SARS-CoV-2 virions, except for one rabbit serum sample collected 6 weeks post-immunization (rabbit E, Figure 7) . The low PI value for this serum sample was likely due to the fact that this rabbit had not yet seroconverted at this early timepoint, which was also reflected by the low absorbance measured for this sample through the indirect ELISA (Figure 7) . When the diagnostic performance of the cELISA was evaluated using sera from COVID-19-free animals as well as sera from qRT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 human patients, a 100% diagnostic specificity (Figure 8b ) and an 80.8% (95% C.I.: 65.6-95.9%) diagnostic sensitivity (Figure 8b ) was demonstrated. Notably, the PI values obtained for the sera from qRT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 human patients possessed a strong positive correlation with their respective absorbance ratios determined by the commercial indirect ELISA (Figure 8b) .",

            "text": "Given its sensitive and specific diagnostic performance with minimal cross reactivities to antisera against \u03b2CoVs other than Sarbecovirus, the cELISA developed in this study is a promising serodiagnostic tool for COVID-19 in animals. The current cELISA can be used for testing virtually all kinds of animals. This is because the detection antibody in the assay recognises the amount of monoclonal antibody bound to the coating antigen instead of serum antibodies from the animals and so the assay is not specific to a particular kind of animal. Therefore, this cELISA could serve the purpose of a collection of many normal ELISAs which are specifically designed for testing only one particular animal. There are also a number of advantages in employing this cELISA over nucleic acid amplification tests such as qRT-PCR or reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) [32] as used in diagnosing COVID-19 in humans. First, serological assays are cheap and they do not require special facilities, instruments, or expertise which may not be readily available in resource limited countries [33] . Second, this cELISA is an antibody detection assay, and therefore it checks for any seroconversion of the animals and could confirm whether the animals are genuinely infected by the virus or not. Third, as opposed to obtaining respiratory specimens from animals for subsequent nucleic acid extraction, blood sampling for animals is easier to perform and not as dangerous. In addition to serodiagnosing individual animals, this cELISA can also be used for the mass screening of COVID-19 in husbandry animals. Animal farms and zoos usually house a large quantity of animals belonging to many different species, and so this cELISA is particularly useful in these settings. Notably, the cELISA can be incorporated into routine blood testing in animal farms or zoos, and therefore, additional specimen sampling is not required. Furthermore, a small yet representative number of animals from an independent herd can be sampled for testing to infer the immune status of animals in the entire herd, without the need of testing every single individual animal. When a high percentage of animals in a population is tested positive by this cELISA, they should be isolated and have a nucleic acid amplification test performed to confirm the occurrence of any ongoing outbreak. For example, mink farmers could collect blood samples from their animals and submit for testing by this cELISA at regular intervals to monitor any COVID-19 infection in their minks. While any positive result could help mink farmers identify infected animals/herds and initiate isolation or mass slaughter strategies, negative results from such routine testing could help avoid unnecessary loss of animal lives.

After washing, the secondary antibody (goat anti-guinea pig IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) diluted in the enzyme dilution buffer (1\u00d7 PBS, 20% normal goat serum [v/v] and 0.1% Tween 20 [v/v]) at 2000fold was added to the wells. Then, the microtitre plate was incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 30 min and washed again using PBS with 0.3% Tween 20 (v/v). An enzymatic reaction, using 100 \u00b5L of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as the substrate, was developed for 10 min at room temperature and then stopped with 100 \u00b5L of 0.3 M H 2 SO 4 . The optical densities of the resultant reaction mixtures were read at 450 nm using the VICTOR X3 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).",

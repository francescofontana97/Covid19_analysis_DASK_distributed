By measuring continuous interstitial glucose levels, along with the traditional intermittent glucose checks, investigators found that glucose concentrations increased over the first 18 hours of life, stabilized and then increased to adult concentrations by day 4. They also found that on continuous monitoring, 73% of these asymptomatic infants had at least one episode of hypoglycemia, defined as \u2264 47mg/dL, with a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f median of 5.5 hours out of the first 4 days of life spent in that hypoglycemic range. 11 Without any signs of pathology and with such high incidence, it is difficult to discern the precise point at which hypoglycemia crosses from physiologic to pathologic.",

The authors also found that prolonged exposure to hypoglycemia was associated with worse outcomes, noting that 5 or more separate days of low glucose levels conferred a 3.5 times higher adjusted risk of developmental delay and cerebral palsy compared with normoglycemic infants.

In one US study, where universal glucose screening was performed on all newborns born in one state, a single episode of hypoglycemia, <45mg/dL, significantly increased the risk of future failure of 4 th grade literacy and mathematics proficiency exams. 5 Another large trial from New Zealand, designed to determine the safety and efficacy of glucose gel, found no association between hypoglycemic episodes and negative neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age, irrespective of gel treatment. 17 Similarly, another New Zealand large prospective J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cohort also detected no association between hypoglycemia and poor neurological outcomes at 2 years of age. 18 However, when this same cohort was evaluated at 4.5 years of age, a dose dependent risk of poor executive function and visual motor impairment was detected, with both severity of nadirs and frequency of episodes augmenting the risk. 19 Furthermore, interventions to maintain euglycemia did not negate this effect, and over 21% of hypoglycemic episodes found on masked continuous monitoring were not picked up by traditional intermittent screening.",

The Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) recommends a cut off for treatment at mean or expected normal glucose values, whereas the AAP recommends the cutoff at the lower 95 th percentile, among other different clinical recommendations (Figure) . 22 The AAP guidelines, written in 2011 and then reaffirmed in 2015, recommend the target for intervention be set at <25 mg/dL in the first 4 hours with subsequent targets rising to 35 mg/dL and 40 mg/d in the first 24 and 48 hours respectively. 23 The guidelines from the PES were published in 2015 in response to criticisms that the AAP guidelines were lax and missed neonates with critical inborn errors of metabolism. 24 They propose using a target glucose of >50 mg/dL for the entire first 48 hours of life and recommend longer testing duration.

Multiple heel sticks in the first days of life may lead to bruising and pain related stress, that may impact future pain response and neurodevelopmental outcomes. 25 One study which specifically looked at pain responses in infants of diabetic mothers found that exposure to frequent heel lances was associated with the development of hyperalgesia, with a more intense pain response after initial hypoglycemia J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f screening. 26 Point of care glucose measurements are inherently inaccurate. Test strip devices are often designed with adult diabetic populations in mind, translating to better precision at higher glucose readings, but higher margins of error at lower levels targeted in the neonatal population. False positive results lead to more testing, which in turn may lead to increased mother-baby separation, familial anxiety, and decreased rates of sustained breastfeeding. 27 Alternatives to invasive screening may include more frequent clinical assessment for symptoms, consultation of lactation specialists or prophylactic administration of supplemental formula or oral glucose gel. However, these more proactive and preventative options, without associated blood sampling, likely carry a higher risk of failing to diagnose an episode of hypoglycemia.",

In the case of asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia, trends in available data and physiologic reasoning would suggest the potential for significant consequences. Few would debate that deficiencies of metabolic substrate in a developing brain could lead to irreparable neuronal injury. There have been several small case series which reported abnormal and characteristic MRI findings in infants who had neonatal hypoglycemia. However, in all the cases described, infants presented with convulsions and were secondarily found to have low glucose levels. [28] [29] Although hypoglycemia appears to be a common problem for the newborn, reports of these most severe presentations appear to be rare, with the less than 50 cases described, most of which are associated with rare inborn errors of metabolism. 20, [28] [29] In the asymptomatic infant, the literature appears to be split on hypoglycemia's impact on future functioning, with the most pessimistic reports predicting sensory processing and executive function deficits.",

There is no way to calculate the potential harm of disenfranchising a parent in the care of their child. Short-term harm to the therapeutic relationship is likely, but the distrust sown in the newborn period could also lead to a future reluctance surrounding medical recommendations. In extreme cases, parental distrust can lead to a complete rejection of all future medical care and ultimately lead to more harm to the child. The screening itself is an imperfect test, with a high likelihood for a positive result, debated thresholds for pathology and intervention, and an incomplete understanding of what reliably predicts deleterious harm. Although these harms may be less significant in severity when compared with future neurological functioning, they are arguably more likely to occur. Likewise, no study to date has demonstrated efficacy of our current interventions for preventing future neurological impairment related to hypoglycemia. Clinical trials designed to delineate precise thresholds and risks would not be ethically permissible, as they would require denying treatment to some infants and exposing others to undue risk. In the case of the asymptomatic infant at risk for hypoglycemia, the data will always be imperfect and as a result, clinicians must choose a course of action based on the best available evidence and the individual circumstances.",

            "text": "For parental refusal of any medical recommendation, including the case of screening for asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia, there are two thresholds of the assessed risk/benefit balance which must be considered. The first threshold is reached when the available information regarding the test or intervention under consideration indicates that the anticipated benefits outweigh risks. When this threshold is reached, the test should be recommended to parents, and generally be part of standard care. Similarly, if risks outweigh benefits, it should not be part of standard care, and the physician should recommend against it. In either case, the right of parental authority is such that informed parents may choose to reject the recommendation, and the clinician should honor that refusal. 30 However, a second, more stringent threshold may be reached, when the anticipated benefits vastly outweigh the risks, and it is strongly in the child's best interest to undergo the test or intervention in question. This second threshold may apply, for example, when the anticipated harm of forgoing the test includes severe consequences. In considering whether the recommended test reaches this second, higher threshold, the clinician should assess both the likelihood and the severity of the harm anticipated in forgoing the test, and the data and/or physiological reasoning supporting that assessment. When this second threshold has been reached, a screening test or intervention should no longer be considered merely advisable or recommended, but rather ethically obligatory. 31 At this second, higher threshold, the parental right to decide for their child should be outweighed by the child's right to protection from harm, and the clinician's obligation to provide that protection. 4 Given what is known and what remains to be elucidated, hypoglycemia screening in most highrisk asymptomatic term newborns is here suggested to be advisable, consistent with professional J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f guidelines, but the evidence does not meet the ethical threshold to supersede parental refusal.",

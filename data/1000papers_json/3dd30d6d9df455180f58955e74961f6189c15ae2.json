Study Design: A dynamic, discrete-time, stochastic individual-based model was developed to simulate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission. Methods: The model was fitted to the observed trends in COVID-19 deaths and intensive care unit (ICU) bed use in Greece. Results: If Greece had not implemented social distancing interventions, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed between 30 March and 4 April. The combined social distancing interventions and increase in ICU beds averted 4360 (95% credibility interval: 3050, 5700) deaths and prevented the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed. Conclusions: The quick and accurate interventions of the Greek government limited the burden of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

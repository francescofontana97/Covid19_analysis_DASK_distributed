For example, GM foods have low support in Europe and India. With the passing years, there is further decline in public support, probably due to media focus and the visible debates on GM crops for fear of their long-term effects and unknown risks and environmental safety issues. The controversies from nongovernment organizations (NGOs), scientists, and media have led to a negative impact on the GM crops. GM crop usage has been controversial with fears being expressed on Flavr Savr tomato and many others. GM food again went into controversy due to labeling issues. The Bt crops were challenged with the development of resistance in insects. So-called terminator technology and a gene use restriction technology (GURT) met with a lot of resistance due to introduction of negative traits of sterility in the seeds and never came to the market.",

This theory advocates the selection of moral action, which in its consequence brings greatest happiness for the large number of people. It works to decide the result or consequences of good action, which would maximize happiness. Thus it deals with consequences of action, in that happiness is judged because of some decision. However, greatest good for an individual or society, human race, or animals is debated. Their supporters say that the theory aims to do good for the human race as a whole including nonhuman animals. For example, terminally ill patients should be allowed for physician-assisted mercy killing to avoid pain and sufferings.

They work with these agents either for the purposes of diagnostics or research. \u2022 Many laboratory-induced infections were reported among the workers and several of them were serious and resulted in death of workers. These laboratory-induced infections were due to organisms in biorisk-3 and biorisk-4 groups. \u2022 Thus, it becomes very important to do appropriate risk assessment, monitoring, and installation of appropriate preventive measure like biosafety levels and biocontainment facility and training to the laboratory workers for prevention. \u2022 Bioethical issues are there with all the major achievements of biotechnology . The issues were being raised because of rightness or wrongness of the experiment, to ensure experiments are conducted in a way that it ensures safety for all, the humans, animals, and the environment. \u2022 Bioethical issues related with genetically modifi ed crops are related to development of resistance in insect-resistant crops and their impact on the environment, animals, and humans. Many ethical issues were raised for genetically modifi ed animals and their sufferings. \u2022 Embryonic stem cell therapy and assisted reproductive technologies along with genetically modifi ed crops faced too much of ethical discussions and resistance. Human reproductive cloning created tremendous furor; thus, human cloning in all forms was banned in most of the countries. \u2022 As with any other technological advancements, each technology is faced with ethical and social issues and so is biotechnology . However, it is important that before we keep on proceeding, we should ask some basic questions to ourselves: (1) Why am I doing this? (2) Would it be benefi cial for anyone? ",

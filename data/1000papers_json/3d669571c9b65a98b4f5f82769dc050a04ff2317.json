            "text": "Purpose The patient concerns inventory (PCI) is a prompt list allowing head and neck cancer (HNC) patients to discuss issues that otherwise might be overlooked. This trial evaluated the effectiveness of using the PCI at routine outpatient clinics for one year after treatment on health-related QOL (HRQOL). Methods A pragmatic cluster preference randomised control trial with 15 consultants, 8 'using' and 7 'not using' the PCI intervention. Patients treated with curative intent (all sites, disease stages, treatments) were eligible. Results Consultants saw a median (inter-quartile range) 16 (13-26) patients, with 140 PCI and 148 control patients. Of the pre-specified outcomes, the 12-month results for the mean University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOLv4) socialemotional subscale score suggested a small clinical effect of intervention of 4.6 units (95% CI 0.2, 9.0), p = 0.04 after full adjustment for pre-stated case-mix. Results for UW-QOLv4 overall quality of life being less than good at 12 months (primary outcome) also favoured the PCI with a risk ratio of 0.83 (95% CI 0.66, 1.06) and absolute risk 4.8% (\u2212 2.9%, 12.9%) but without achieving statistical significance. Other non-a-priori analyses, including all 12 UWQOL domains and at consultant level also suggested better HRQOL with PCI. Consultation times were unaffected and the number of items selected decreased over time. Conclusion This novel trial supports the integration of the PCI approach into routine consultations as a simple low-cost means of benefiting HNC patients. It adds to a growing body of evidence supporting the use of patient prompt lists more generally.",

Following treatment, HNC patients have a wide variety and level of unmet needs, with psychological unmet needs being most prevalent [4] . Emotional concerns can be difficult to elicit indicating the importance of undertaking holistic assessments in an attempt to uncover unmet needs [5] .",

A recent systematic review and content comparison of unmet needs self-report measures used in patients with HNC favoured the PCI compared to 13 other tools [8] . The PCI consists of 56 clinical items and has been used by patients in outpatient clinics, before seeing their consultant. The list guides the outpatient consultation and it covers a range of symptoms and potential problems patients may face after treatment. It has been shown to be feasible in routine consultations [9, 10] and for wider adoption across a cancer network [11] . It is possible to augment the PCI with feedback from the patient as to their HRQOL outcome and one example of this is through the use of the University of Washington questionnaire (UW-QOLv4) [12, 13] . The combination of the PCI and UW-QOL has been shown to be feasible in routine practice and early evidence would suggest that their use in consultations could have a beneficial impact on quality of life [14, 15] . With established cut-offs, it is possible to highlight those doing less well [16] . As outlined in the trial protocol [17] and baseline findings [18] , the trial intervention involved a one-page patient summary sheet that was printed following patient completion of the questionnaires on an iPad. This information sheet showed the PCI items flagged, domains of UW-QOL dysfunction, overall QOL, distress thermometer (DT) score and number of health professionals that patients identified as possibly wishing to see, were taken into the consultation with the patient.",

All 15 eligible consultants (the clustering factor) were randomised, 8 to 'using' and 7 to 'not using' an intervention incorporating the PCI prompt list at all their trial clinics. Consultants with preferences were given their preferred group and those without preference were randomised, so as to limit the possibility of PCI-sceptics dominating the PCI group and PCI-enthusiasts the non-PCI group. Preference-based methodologies have been used in the evaluation of interventions that are about clinical behaviour change to minimise the impact of pre-conceived ideas [19] . Allocation was overseen by the trial medical statistician, before any patient recruitment and was blind to consultant name. In Leeds, three consultants preferred to use the PCI, while three without preference became controls. In Liverpool, three consultants preferred to be controls and the other five without preference were randomised, one as a control and four to using the PCI. A new Aintree consultant, in post soon after the trial began, was randomised to the PCI group. Quality assurance was by initial training and booster sessions for PCI consultants and through a post-consultation survey of PCI patients asking how much the consultant had made reference to the PCI prompt sheet during the consultation.",

Criteria derived from earlier work can indicate the domains in which patients have a significant problem or dysfunction [16] . A single overall QOL question on the UWQOL v4 asks patients to consider not only physical and mental health, but also other factors, such as family, friends, spirituality or personal leisure activities important to their enjoyment of life; response options are outstanding, very good, good, fair, poor, and very poor.",

Logistic regression (STATA logit) with robust standard errors and cluster option was also used. Estimates were adjusted for baseline values of the outcome, for consultant clustering and for pre-specified covariates of gender, age (< 55, 55-64, 65-74, \u2265 75), tumour site (oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, other), overall clinical grade (early 1-2, advanced 3-4), treatment (surgery only, RT or CT/RT only, surgery with RT or CT/RT,) and free-flap transfer treatment (Yes, No, No surgery). Random effects linear regression (STATA xtreg procedure) estimated the treatment-effect difference in UWQOL socio-emotional mean subscale scores, with adjustments for baseline subscale scores (quintile categories), for consultant clustering and for the pre-specified covariates. Standard errors were estimated by a cluster bootstrap that resampled with replacement over consultant clusters. In non-apriori analyses, the UWQOL physical function subscale score and all 12 UWQOL domain scores were analysed in the same way using random effects linear regression. Quintile categories were created for baseline physical function subscale scores and a three-level categorisation into best score (100), dysfunction, and in-between these extremes was used for baseline UWQOL domain scores. We used the estimator provided by the loneway command in STATA v13 to estimate outcome ICCs.",

Its use adds an element of quality assurance particularly when the patient is less familiar to the consultant or is being reviewed by a more junior member of staff. The consultants' training focused on ensuring that issues identified by the patient were considered and if there were too many issues raised, there was then an agreement with the patient to focus on three or four they felt most important.

Variables used to adjust the analyses were also specified in advance, and included tumour site, stage and treatment. Therefore, the main confidence interval estimations can be interpreted without concern about post hoc selection. Other analyses should be regarded as exploratory. Our findings should have generalisability given that all eligible consultants from the two hospitals participated throughout the trial. In addition, there was good recruitment and sustainability throughout the trial in those patients often hard to reach, such as the elderly and those in more socially deprived groups. The choice of a cluster design is a strength of the study, the rationale behind which was discussed in detail in the baseline results paper [18] ; individual patient randomisation was ruled out because of the likely sensitization of consultants to using the PCI, which could have led to certain strategies being carried over to when control group patients were being seen. A further strength of the trial was the relatively small proportion of refusals and withdrawals through patient choice, and the number missed for logistical reasons by trial staff was also small. Another strength was the electronic data capture which, apart from the paper-based baseline questionnaire, virtually eliminated missing data in the outpatient clinic setting. From this study, in terms of the primary outcome of less than good overall QOL at 12 months, the best estimate after various adjustments, including baseline level, was an absolute benefit at 12 months of about 5% from the PCI intervention and a risk ratio of 0.83 which suggests about one in six patients might benefit. Interpretation, however, is made difficult due to wide confidence intervals that include no benefit at all.",

Although the benefit from PCI intervention of 4.6 units in the social-emotional subscale score at 12 months after adjustment seems small, it is clinically meaningful [22] . It is of note also that results for all 12 UW-QOL domains favoured the PCI with a small benefit (Table 5) , with improvements also seen for both groups over time which probably reflects adaption over the year. Fear of recurrence is frequently raised by patients on the PCI (Fig. 2) and is recognised as a major concern over many follow-up consultations [31] . It remains to be fully evaluated but the hypothesis is that the prompt allows the patient permission to talk about this aspect and seek reassurance or further information. The PCI approach might be very helpful for those HNC patients likely to take a more passive role in medical consultations, such as patients of lower socioeconomic strata [32] .",

It is possible that the simplicity of the binary primary overall QOL outcome in this trial diluted the benefit patients gained from this intervention. When analysing the change in overall QOL across all six-response options for overall QOL, the PCI group appeared to do slightly better (Table 6 ). Given the variation in numbers of patients by consultant and variation in types of patients seen and treated, it was reassuring to see that the analyses at consultant level (Table 7) provided some support, be it at a rather simplistic summary level, of the main Table 5 Other UWQOL outcomes (not pre-specified) for 100 PCI and 105 control patients with data at baseline and at 12 months ICC Intra-class correlation for physical subscale score estimated as 0.0125, with 95% confidence interval of (0, 0.0786) a Baseline value: Quintile categorisation for UWQOL Physical function; 3-level categorisation into best score, dysfunction, and in-between these extremes for the 12 9.8) findings reported at patient level. Whereas the unadjusted results for the DT (Table 3 ) tended to favour the PCI, as did the results after adjustment for baseline value and clustering, the results after full adjustment did not favour either group. No trial of this size stands alone as evidence and further trials would provide reassurance of the positive indications suggested by this trial. The inclusion of the PCI does not significantly lengthen the consultation time since in comparison to the control group the first trial PCI consultations only took one minute longer on average whilst at 12 months they were one minute shorter.",

Further losses between baseline and the final trial clinic (Fig. 1) were predominantly for clinical reasons or because of COVID-19. Pragmatically, we accept that \"size and power are irrelevant once the experiment has actually been carried out. At this point, the trial is analysed using confidence intervals to show the plausible values for the treatment effects\" [33] . One unavoidable limitation was the lack of blinding but this is a distinctive feature of pragmatic cluster trials. Since recruitment of patients took place after the randomisation of clusters, there was always a possibility of selection bias, but this was minimised because patients were allocated to individual consultants through the cancer tracking referral process without knowing which consultants used PCI and which did not.",

An implementation phase could include aspects of patient-clinician communication and patient empowerment. It would be interesting to apply the intervention earlier in the follow-up of patients as perhaps there might be more benefit, possibly starting in the pre-treatment phase. To achieve this, appropriate IT infrastructure is required to allow patients to access the PCI tool prior to their consultation and allow this to be integrated into clinical care. This needs to be part of an integrated strategy of engaging patients using IT technology. The need for IT solutions around COVID-19 might hasten the breakdown of barriers previously encountered by both patients and clinicians in respect of IT.",

Notable strengths of this study were the originality (landmark trial) with 15 consultants in a routine NHS outpatient setting, its clinical significance as a low-cost intervention and a strong contribution made by patients themselves to the design and delivery of the trial. Clinicians find the PCI straightforward to use, with minimal training, with the vast majority of patients appreciating the approach and wishing to continue to use it in the future. The study suggests a small but meaningful benefit in outcomes from this PCI approach using routine care. Such interventions are increasingly important given the rising incidence of HNC, more people living longer with the burden of treatment-related issues and the importance of addressing unmet needs in the early post-treatment survivorship phase.

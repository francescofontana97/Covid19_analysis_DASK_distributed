            "text": "As indicated by the common expression of \"gifted and talented\" education in the United States, most scholars of giftedness embrace the idea of a developmental trajectory throughout the life-span (e.g., Tannenbaum, 2009 ). This concept is consistent with traditional Eastern/Asian conceptions of giftedness (Phillipson, 2013) and ecological European perspectives (Ziegler, 2005; Ziegler et al., 2017) . Treffinger (1998) urged the field to move from gifted education to talent development with a Levels of Services (LoS) model, which is similar to the popular special-educational model of Response to Intervention (RTI). Their similarity lies in offering appropriate educational services based on a student's response (e.g., interest, motivation, and mastery) to those services. This developmental model avoids putting too much effort into identification processes that may not be accurate, efficient, or fair. Gagn\u00e9's (2004) Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talents explicitly distinguishes the concepts of gifts as high levels of inborn abilities, and talents as acquired skills/mastery. This model integrated high potential (nature) and the developmental and contextual process (nurture) to result in high performance. In other words, an individual with high intelligence should also obtain appropriate training and educational opportunities to fulfill their gifts. This trajectory view is supported by the comprehensive mega model of talent development (Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, & Worrell, 2011 ). The mega model integrates the internal and external factors that comprise giftedness on the developmental spectrum (i.e., from potential to achievement to eminence). This model was influenced by Tannenbaum's (2009) Star model, which includes a chance factor and discusses the developmental dynamics between one's ability and environmental support.",

In South Korea, for example, 90% of gifted students are specifically chosen for their STEM abilities (Cho & Suh, 2016) .

These populations often do not fit into the general educational systems due to reasons such as their cultural, linguistic, or neurocognitive individuality (see Davis, Rimm, & Siegle, 2011) . Reis (1998) and Kerr and Gahm (2017) have studied how to guide gifted females to develop their potential. In a longitudinal study about the mathematically gifted, gender differences in preferred academic domains and careerchoice indicators were found (Lubinski & Benbow, 2006) , although it is unclear how much of this result came from biological, social influences, or both. However, considering that there are only 53 females out of the 919 total Nobel Laureates (Nobel Media AB, n.d.) , underachievement in females still seems real. Reis (this volume) emphasizes that for gifted females to be successful and productive, they should be sure to incorporate their personal interests and pursue meaningful work. Gifted students with a disability, often called twice-exceptional learners (Reis, Baum, & Burke, 2014) , have been embraced in the gifted field (S. B. Kaufman, 2018) . Common challenges include neurodevelopmental issues, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (e.g., Gomez, Stavropoulos, Vance, & Griffiths, 2019) , specific learning disorders (e.g., Berninger & Abbott, 2013; Ottone-Cross et al., 2017) , autism spectrum disorder (e.g., Assouline, Foley-Nicpon, & Dockery, 2012; Neihart, 2004) , as well as social-emotional issues (e.g., Daniels & Piechowski, 2009; Vuyk, Krieshok, & Kerr, 2016) .",

For example, Renzulli (1978) included creativity as a major component in his Three-ring Conception of Giftedness, alongside above-average ability and task commitment. His model opened up gifted resources to a wider range of students (Delisle, Reis, & Gubbins, 1981) and has been developed into a schoolwide system (Reis & Renzulli, 1997 , 2014 . The Student Product Assessment Form was developed to evaluate the creative products of gifted students (Reis & Renzulli, 1991) . Sternberg's (2005 Sternberg's ( , 2009 ) WICS model posits that gifted individuals synthesize wisdom, intelligence, and creativity. This model builds on his concept of successful intelligence, which is the ability to achieve one's life goal by adapting to, manipulating, and choosing one's context, maximizing one's strengths and compensating for weaknesses (Sternberg, 1996) . Even if a person displays high levels of intelligence and creativity, those alone are not sufficient to be gifted in the WICS model. The wisdom component, therefore, emphasizes ethical values over extreme individualism, which can be easily linked to leadership in society (Sternberg, 2008) . Creativity, in this model, is a decision or attitude to implement original ideas in an uncertain environment. The Rainbow Assessment was developed to measure creativity and practical skills in addition to traditionally measured analytical skills. This combination better predicted freshman college grades than did the SAT; it also demonstrated reduced ethnic differences (Sternberg & The Rainbow Project Collaborators, 2006) .",

            "text": "Creativity is traditionally defined by two main elements: (1) originality/newness/novelty and (2) usefulness/appropriateness in the context (J. C. Kaufman & Gl\u0103veanu, 2019) . Creativity has most commonly been categorized into the Four Ps: the person, process, press (i.e., environment), and product (Rhodes, 1961) . The creative person engages in the creative process, ideally in a supportive press, which can result in a creative product. This individual-based approach was refined by Gl\u0103veanu (2013) into the Five As: the actor, action, affordances, audience, and artifact. The key difference is that the general term of \"press\" is broken down into two separate concepts: the audience, which constitutes both the people who will eventually appreciate the work and those who guide the creator; and the affordances, which are the material and social resources that can be utilized. The Five As interact together and emphasize the sociocultural aspects of creativity. A gifted creator needs to be given some level of support by affordances and an audience. The Four C model (Beghetto & Kaufman, 2007 ; J. C. Kaufman & Beghetto, 2009 ) proposes a developmental trajectory across four stages. At the mini-c level, creativity is personally new and meaningful; it includes potential and creative insights that can come as part of the learning process. Little-c is everyday creativity, which is the type of work that can be enjoyed by others (such as someone making YouTube videos as a hobby). Pro-c is expert-level creativity (such as an accomplished pianist), and Big-C is the level of historically long-lasting creative geniuses (such as Marie Curie or Louis Armstrong). This model helps articulate the pathway that a gifted student can become a creatively accomplished adult. Further, the Four Cs stress that Big-C is not a good comparison point. Aspiring gifted writers should not be using John Steinbeck or Toni Morrison as a metric of what it takes to be creative; they should not particularly compare themselves to the Pro-c level of current, published authors. Teachers ideally should recognize and value mini-c and little-c contributions and see them as part of a pathway toward creative excellence (Beghetto, Kaufman, & Baer, 2014) .",

Required components for the process include relevant cognitive abilities, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and a supportive environment. Sternberg (2018) expanded the idea of defying the crowd to also encompass defying one's self and the Zeitgeist. Amabile (1983) highlights the importance of creativity-relevant skills (such as being able to tolerate ambiguity), domain-specific skills (such as an architect having high visual-spatial abilities and a knowledge of classical buildings), and intrinsic motivation. Csikszentmihalyi (1988) looked at how the creator interacts with the field (such as the gatekeepers who determine what is published, funded, or produced) and the domain (the standards of a particular area, such as what are considered creative and successful music compositions). Generally, these same ingredients for being creative are equally important for creative giftedness.",

It categorizes such hidden creativity based on what is still needed to be recognized by a general audience: capital, awareness, spark, and exceptionality. Capital includes having the relevant knowledge, power, and status to bring creative work to light. Many creative ideas may not be recognized as such because they are missing relevant jargon or are outside of the current domain. Awareness includes being aware that one is being creative (both at a specific time and as part of one's ongoing routine). Many people may be creative but simply not realize or recognize that. Spark is being the one who initiates a creative idea. It is easy not to recognize people who continue creative work or build on other's creations. Finally, exceptionality includes interactive outcomes between unusually elegant creative expressions and audiences' appreciation. Many creators may regularly produce solid but unspectacular work that may be underappreciated. Just as incorporating creativity into giftedness helps recognize students who might otherwise be overlooked, the CASE model aims to highlight creative people who might traditionally be missed.",

It is reminiscent of a scene in The Incredibles, when Elastigirl tells her son, Dash, that everyone is special. He responds by saying that if everyone is special, then no one is. It is a concept later revisited by the villain, Syndrome. If we are too inclusive about what \"counts\" as being creative, does that negate actual gifted creative contributions? It is here that the many approaches come in handy. Considering creativity across different domains, levels, and interactions on specific individual difference variables (such as personality) allow us to add an enriched meaning for the idea of \"creativity for all.\" It may, for example, not involve shifting paradigms or introducing a new framework but rather, integrating them. Indeed, psychology has a long history of Euro-centered perspectives, regardless of many psychologists' efforts to understand humanity as a whole (Sue & Sue, 2016) . Gifted education is also not free from Western bias; despite culturally different conceptions of giftedness, many Asian countries' efforts to modernize their gifted education is based on traditional Western perspectives . Additionally, a systematic examination of giftedness studies in PsycINFO indicated that 84% were conducted in America, Europe, or Australia, thus lacking cross-culturally diverse representation . By recognizing creativity and going beyond the traditional IQ-based ways of defining giftedness, we can possibly increase diversity in gifted education (Luria, O'Brien, & Kaufman, 2016) .",

However, differentiated instruction is incredibly challenging to be implemented, in part due to a lack of resources to support classroom teachers (Carolan & Guinn, 2007; Delisle, 2015) . Now visualize this same classroom with 20 elementary students in a reading class. Having each student exploring divergent and creative answers instead of landing by rote on the convergent answer in the answer key becomes a luxury that requires much additional time and energy. Similarly, IQ tests are easy to administer because their items have one correct answer, but creativity assessments rarely have one correct answer. One problem with convergent answer-based tests is a language/cultural bias (Flanagan, Ortiz, & Alfonso, 2013) .",

One study found that linguistic programs that use text analysis can predict human ratings of creative writing (Zedelius, Mills, & Schooler, 2019) . Some video games have been designed to subtly measure creativity components (Shute, Wang, Greiff, Zhao, & Moore, 2016) and develop each gamer's problem-solving (Ke, Shute, Clark, & Erlebacher, 2019) during adaptive gameplay. However, such advances are largely at the research level; ideally, they can be used widely as efficient and diagnostic creativity assessments for the classroom.

The Pok\u00e9mon universe, on the other hand, is filled with hundreds of unique characters who adventure in relatively repetitive episodes (comparable to mini-c). Their stories are not as grand as Superman's spectacular adventures, nor are their abilities as aweinspiring, yet they nonetheless work together to defeat the various villains. Each Pok\u00e9mon has unique strengths and weaknesses. Their success does not lie in one Pok\u00e9mon's individual heroic power, but rather collaboration. As they use their unique skills, whether through real-world fights or training, they level up, evolve, and become more resilient. Both the Superman and Pok\u00e9mon comics are incredibly popular; personal preferences may vary, but each has enormous audiences. Similarly, just as the creative contributions from a few Big-C creators are essential to sustain a healthy global community, so too are the work of the multitudes of little-c or mini-c creators.",

Years later, it was her diary that spoke to so many people and gave a face to the victims of the Holocaust. Simon Wiesenthal tracked down the Nazi who arrested Frank in part to prove to a young Holocaust denier that the young diarist actually lived and, thus, the Holocaust actually happened (Wiesenthal & Wechsberg, 1967) .",

People around the world must cope with a tremendously ambiguous situation, worries about their health, and anxiety about how everything may change when it is resolved. Just as the ease of travel may have contributed to the virus's spread, so too can the ease of communication enable all types of creativity to help during this time of crisis. A creative scientist may make a Pro-c or Big-C breakthrough and help treat or cure the virus, and such a contribution is, of course, vitally important. Yet recognizing this high-level achievement does not need to diminish the millions of mini-c or little-c creators whose contributions are also vital. Across the world, groups, organizations and communities are creating systems and procedures to implement safety guidelines in their unique context (including available resources). Some are using their creativity to make humorous memes or videos of themselves singing that can cheer up people who are homebound. Others are being creative in gathering resources for those in need, or simply to entertain and educate children stuck at home. These efforts are not exclusive to one community; many specific examples of lower-level creativity happen across the world. At the beginning of the pandemic in China, internet users foiled censorship to share a doctor's honest warning in public (Li, 2020) . In Italy, residents in an apartment complex played music together in their own balcony to boost morale (Thorpe, 2020) . In South Korea, innovative drive-through clinics enabled 15,000 tests in a day, which was adopted by some US communities due to its efficiency (Kuhn, 2020) .",

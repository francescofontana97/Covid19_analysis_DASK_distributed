While changing external conditions certainly affect public confidence and influence attitudes towards defence and foreign affairs and their institutional expression, social and political changes also play an important role. In this chapter we turn our attention primarily towards this latter category: public attitudes towards the creation and implementation of defence and security policies in Australia. We do so through examining trends in three key areas: the level of confidence the public has in defence as an institution; public perceptions of the role that the military plays in society; and the willingness of voters to increase defence spending.",

External shocks heighten public awareness of defence and foreign policy issues and have served to both increase confidence at moments of crisis as well as raise alarm at the level of preparedness of the defence force to meet them. The types of operations the military is involved in also matters, and reveals that public opinion discerns the difference between the types of capabilities required for intensive combat as compared to peacekeeping operations. Values also enter the debate at this stage, with the public more likely to support the deployment of troops for missions with clear and achievable short-term objectives-such as peacekeeping operations-than for engagements in which the military objectives are combat-focused, less well defined and longer term.",

The changes taking place in Australia's engagement with the world were significant and involved no less than a shift in alliance from the U.K. to the U.S. as security guarantor. As we discuss in detail in Chapter 3, public opinion during the post Second World War years displayed high levels of anxiety about rising Japanese militarism and anti-communism, combined with a sense of concern that the major powers did not have a full appreciation for the security interests at stake in the Pacific region. The fall of Singapore in early 1942 to the Japanese highlighted the vulnerability of Australia's security position.",

There was a sense that the U.S. and the other major powers should not be left to negotiate the terms of the peace settlement, given their geographic distance from the threat (Reese 1969: 85) . Reference was frequently made to the strategic decision, adopted unanimously by the U.K. and U.S. in early 1941 (almost a year before the Japanese air raids on Australia), that in the case of war with Japan the European/Atlantic theatre would be given priority over the Pacific. This came as a sharp reminder to Australia that their security could not be left solely in the hands of foreign powers, who defined Western interests in terms of Europe and the Atlantic rather than in Australasia and the Pacific (Reese 1969: 86) .",

As a result, negotiations over the Pacific Pact-which eventually became the ANZUS treaty-took place in a political environment sceptical about the willingness of the major powers to defend Australia as well as the capability of the United Nations to deliver on its collective security promise. 1 Commentary on the early diplomatic efforts of the new Menzies government focused on efforts by the minister for external affairs, Percy Spender, to commit the U.S. to the region through a treaty arrangement. The Country-Liberal Party's entry into government in 1949 brought with it an overhaul of defence and foreign policymaking and a move away from the regional security approach advocated by Evatt and towards a closer alignment with the U.S.",

Yet, in the face of all this turmoil, the available survey evidence suggests that around 1950, opinion was overwhelmingly in favour of a treaty with the U.S. 2 The confidence shown by the public in the leadership of the Menzies government with regard to its negotiation of the security treaty with the U.S. can be partly attributed to the prime minister's personal reluctance to embrace this new, post-Commonwealth identity. As McDonald (2013) notes, the irony of Australia's shift towards away from the UK-in both a military and economic sense-and towards the U.S. is that it occurred under the leadership of a self-professed anglophile. Menzies' reluctance to embrace a new, U.S.-centric security future was founded in his personal disinclination to move away from Australia's British roots, a sentiment that found resonance among the public. In this way, the significant shifts that did take place were stripped of ideological intent and engendered a sense of public confidence that these were sensible and inevitable policy decisions, influenced by the inexorable structural forces that were starting to make themselves felt with the onset of the Cold War.",

The polarised nature of the international system identified the adversaries as well as potential allies. The ANZUS alliance was important in this respect and, as we discuss in Chapter 4, gave the government a great deal of autonomy-at least initially-when it came to decide where to deploy troops abroad. During these decades, then, public attitudes towards defence remained relatively stable and debates over defence preparedness tended to take place outside the political sphere.",

But even here the Vietnam War attracted high levels of support during its early years 3 ; it was not until it became clear that the war could not be won that public support began to erode. 4 The reasons for this erosion of public support, however, went far beyond the question of confidence in defence capability. As Coral Bell (1988: 70) has argued, Vietnam was the 'least popular war in Australia's history', not just because of its military failures, but because 'none of Australia's earlier military adventures had generated the moral qualms or the resentful anger among intelligent young people at the whole structure of political and social authority that were those characteristic to the later stages of the Vietnam War'. The underlying factors contributing to public anger over Australia's participation in Vietnam were largely related to broader social and cultural shifts.",

As a result, the changes in public opinion that did take place, such as during the 1960s, were gradual and in response to external geopolitical circumstances rather than reflective of domestic policy debate. The power politics that informed the foreign policies of the major protagonists during the Cold War also served as a reference point for public attitudes towards defence.",

While confidence measures have remained relatively high, both external political shifts and domestic political factors have renewed debate over how Australia should seek its own security and the role that the ADF plays in society and in securing Australia's interests abroad. The rise of violent extremism in the form of terrorism and insurgency, as well as the growing influence and militarism of China, have brought into focus the uncertainties associated with today's growing world disorder. Public opinion is thus influenced by events that challenge Australian preconceptions about how to secure itself in the midst of such uncertainty, such as the Gulf War, the East Timor crisis and the 9/11 terrorist attacks and subsequent attacks on Australians abroad.",

The major institutions cover the political system (such as parliament, political parties and the electoral system) and extend to civil society (such as universities and trade unions). International research suggests that confidence in many public institutions, especially those related to the operation of democracy, declined uniformly during the 1980s and 1990s (Smith 2012) . It is argued that this can be traced to the rapid expansion of higher education in the advanced societies which has created a large group of mainly younger citizens who subject public institutions to consistent criticism for their perceived lack of performance (Smith 1990 ). Much of this criticism has been reinforced by the use of social media which is believed to foster distrust in institutions (Ceron 2015) . At the same time, confidence in many private institutions has remained stable or even increased, reflecting their ability to deliver economic prosperity, at least up until the 2007-2008 global financial crisis (Newton and Norris 2000) .",

This is attributed to the fact that the decline in Australia may have taken place before the 1980s, when survey data on this topic did not exist; this is the pattern that also occurred in the U.S. (Dalton 1999) .

In 1983, 22% said that they had a great deal of confidence in the defence forces. That figure declined to 15% in 1995, and thereafter has increased, peaking at 40% in 2014 before falling to 31% in 2018. In all but two of the surveys defence is rated more highly than any other institution. The two exceptions are in 1983 and 1995 when the police were rated more highly. The trends therefore show high and gradually increasing public confidence in the two main security organisations, the police and the armed forces. One explanation for this may be the increasing threats from terrorism in the post-9/11 world which brings people together to support the institutions which guarantee public security (Bean 2015) . Note 'I am now going to read out a number of organisations. For each one, could you tell me how much confidence you have in them-is it a great deal of confidence, quite a lot of confidence, not very much confidence, or none at all?'

For example, in 2016 just 2% of the respondents said that they had 'a great deal' of confidence in trade unions, and only 3% had confidence in the federal parliament. Unlike the defence forces and the police, there are few discernible overtime trends in confidence in these institutions, which attract consistently low levels of confidence from the public.",

Another explanation is partisanship. Partisans tend to express more confidence in institutions than those who identify with minor parties or who are non-aligned (Bean 2015) . Relatedly, U.S. research has shown that ideology plays a major role in predicting support for the military, with Republicans becoming consistently more likely to show support than Democrats (Murbach 2019) .

Indeed, in the first equation the variance explained is just 3%, although in 2018 it increases to 9%. However, there is consistency in how the two effects of interest-age and partisanship-influence confidence. In both surveys older respondents have more confidence in defence, net of a wide variety of other factors, and the differences in the impact of age are relatively minor. Age is however second in importance to partisanship. As hypothesised, those who identify with the centre right, in this case the Liberal-National parties, are more confident of defence than Labor partisans, and this effect doubles between 1995 and 2018.

However, given the relative overall weakness of the models in explaining confidence it is obvious that other things matter more. Another explanation for increasing public confidence in defence is the performance of the defence forces in various operations during the 2000s, starting with the East Timor crisis in 2000. In a 2000 survey, 69% of the respondents said that they thought that the defence forces performed 'very well' in the East Timor operation and a further 29% said that they performed 'well'; just 2% expressed a negative view. 7 In the subsequent operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, while there are partisan differences over whether or not the government should have committed Australia's involvement, in general the military are broadly viewed as having performed well. It is possible, then, that these peacekeeping operations influenced public opinion by presenting a positive image of defence and its capabilities. The different nature of these deployments makes it difficult to measure with any accuracy their influence on the public's confidence in defence. Nevertheless, it is possible to trace the public's views of Australia's defence capabilities, which tap into the public's feelings about the ability of defence to handle such operations. A question measuring this aspect of defence has been consistently included in the AES surveys since 1996. These results are shown in Fig. 2.1 .",

Since 2001, the proportion of the population who hold a positive view of defence's capabilities has doubled, at a time when confidence in other public institutions has declined.

In response, policymakers were forced to fundamentally rethink the country's relationship with its immediate region and look to its neighbours as security partners rather than as potential adversaries. By the late 1970s, this change had started to make itself felt in immigration policy, with the Fraser government opening up the borders to thousands of Vietnamese refugees.

The report's key findings revolve around community attitudes towards the military, specifically the place of the ADF in society, its perceived achievements, and its purpose in peacetime. In the face of a growing sense of insecurity occasioned by the resurgence of external security threats and a sense that the ADF could not adequately defend Australia without assistance, the report found a high level of support for the ADF and a 'growing appreciation among the Australian community of the need for a strong, effective and well-funded Defence Force'. Yet at the same time, the report also found that few Australians could clearly articulate the purpose of the ADF, and lacked specific information regarding its composition and functions. The popular image of the armed forces was framed by armed combat, 'thus making it difficult for the army to be seen as relevant to meaningful peacetime activities'. During peacetime, the report concludes, the 'important communications point is that the defence force has no major perceived peacetime role other than waiting for war' (Australian National Opinion Polls 1980).",

The report raised the concern that this image profile was limiting the recruitment pool, reflecting an anglophile, monocultural institution. The report argued that this image did not reflect the lived experiences of large sections of society, particularly potential recruits from indigenous or non-English speaking backgrounds. The ADF, the report posits, should make moves to adopt a more 'Australian identity'. Examples of efforts in this direction include the decision of Lieutenant-General John Grey, the new chief of the general staff, to replace the British lion on his personal crest with the Australian rising sun badge and to wear the Australian slouch hat in place of the British peaked one (Bergin et al. 1993: 124) .",

During the mid 2000s, in what was a very successful bid to attract young people to the armed forces, the army imbued its television advertisements with images of troops engaged in humanitarian and peacekeeping activities, with significantly fewer references to military combat. It also appealed to the ANZAC legend, which grew in prominence as part of political narratives about the ADF from the early 2000s (McDonald 2010: 297) . While the reality of a soldier's life might be far removed from the images of the humanitarian soldier shown in the recruitment material, the explanation for why the army chose to promote the service in this way-and for its success-can be found in deeply held public beliefs regarding Australia's role in regional and global security. 10 One area in which the defence has had a direct impact on society is through conscription or 'national service'. Conscription-sometimes called compulsory military service-was a contentious issue during the First World War when it was rejected in two plebiscites and resulted in a split within the Labor party. Conscription was introduced in the early stages of the Second World War, lasting until 1946. It was again introduced, in various forms, in 1951 at the start of the Korean War and remained in operation until 1959. When Australia began a military commitment to Vietnam in 1962 it was again reintroduced in 1964 and lasted until 1973, one year after Australia withdrew its remaining forces from the country. Figure 2 .2 shows public opinion towards conscription from 1943, just after its introduction in the Second World War, to 1989, the last year for which survey data is available. The poll results come from two sets of surveys, so they are not exactly comparable either in methodology or question wording. Nevertheless, they tell a consistent story. First, throughout the almost half century period, more people have consistently favoured conscription than opposed it, although in the late 1980s the gap between the two groups had shrunk considerably. Second, although there has been a majority in favour of conscription, support was in longterm decline almost from the beginning. This pattern is notwithstanding two peaks in support after the end of the Korean War and towards the end of Australia's Vietnam War involvement. Third, there appears to be little relationship between support for conscription and the period in which conscription was in operation. To the extent that attitudes towards conscription are influenced by contemporary events and policies, government policy on compulsory military training would not appear to be one of them.",

Using the surveys for which age estimates are available, we can see the increase in the proportion of young people who opposed conscription (Fig. 2.3) . For most of the period there are few if any differences in opinion between those aged under 30 years or those aged 30 or over. This pattern changes in the mid-1970s, with the U.S. defeat in Vietnam, and thereafter there is a significant and growing age gap in the proportions supporting conscription.

In the 2016 defence white paper, the Turnbull Coalition government promised to transform Australia's defence capabilities and organisation in order to achieve the country's strategic defence objectives. 11 This would involve increasing the defence budget based on a ten year funding model, with expenditure rising to $42.4 billion in 2020-2021 (Department of Defence 2016). Shortly after the release of the white paper, the 2016-2017 federal budget was handed down and the government demonstrated its commitment to the white paper, allocating $32.4 billion to defence funding, on track to achieving the 2020-2021 goal. In 2019, the budget allocated $38.7 billion to defence. However, while further budget increases have remained a core commitment of the government, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically revised the country's financial position, as well as a number of other factors tied in with defence spending, such as reduced alliance activity and delays in acquisition projects. It therefore remains to be seen how the defence budget will be affected (Hellyer 2020) .",

The first peak occurs just after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 when 77% supported increased spending, compared to just 15% who wanted less. The second peak occurs after the East Timor crisis in 2000 and the 9/11 attacks in the U.S. in 2001; at this point around six in every 10 respondents wanted an increase in defence spending. The two lowest points for defence spending come in 1990, following the Notwithstanding the peaks and troughs in the trends in Fig. 2.4 , the long-term pattern across the 1975 to 2019 period is for a gradual decrease in support for defence spending. Indeed, there are three time points when the proportion of survey respondents who want to see less spending rather than more. The first is in 1990, following the end of the Cold War, while the second is in 2009 and is related to the austerity that followed the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. The third is in 2016 and appears to be the continuation of a trend that began in 2010. Drawing a trend-line through the four decades of survey results suggests that the rate of the decline in public support for defence spending is almost 1 percentage point per year, or around 9 percentage points per decade. In the absence of a major international crisis that could influence the public's views of the necessity of defence, we would expect that decline to continue. Certainly the figure for 2016-the lowest at any point in the series-suggests a strong reversion to the general downward trend.",

While Australians still report feeling relatively secure and confident in their armed forces capabilities, the 2016 defence white paper indicated a clear shift in Canberra's strategic thinking. The white paper talks in clear terms about the ways in which shifting power dynamics in the region poses challenges to the rules-based order 'leading to uncertainty and tension' (Department of Defence 2016). This language, clearly directed at China, is a significant departure from previous public analysis about the future role China will play in the region (Schreer 2016 ). The defence white paper also sets out an expanded military role for the defence force in the region, with the development of a 'future force' that is 'more capable, agile and potent' in response, among other things, to Chinese adventurism in the South China Sea. The challenge for government is making the case for increased government spending on defence to the public, while at the same time justifying reduced spending on other government services. This challenge is likely to become more acute as the economic climate becomes more restrictive following the impact of COVID-19.",

The results show that defence ranks ninth out of the 10 areas, just ahead of business and industry but behind that perennially unpopular area of government expenditure, unemployment benefits. The top priorities for expenditure in the public's view are health, with 79% advocating increased spending, and education, where 73% want an increase. These patterns suggest that defence is a very low priority for government spending. Moreover, there has been little change in these patterns since 2013 when the question was first asked in the AES survey. 13 Against this background of public pressure for spending on government services that directly affects citizens, it is not surprising that successive governments have found it difficult to increase defence spending. In addition, political instability and electoral volatility have characterised politics since 2010, making it even more difficult to prosecute the case for more defence spending. The 2011 defence budget, when the Abbott government came to power, was significantly weakened by a convergence of international and domestic factors. A series of delays and cuts to defence funding accompanied with continuing military operations in the Middle East and the continuation of expanding capability plans left defence with 'a long shopping list and a shrinking purse to pay for it' (Thomson 2016) . Alongside this, there was increasing pressure from the U.S. for more burden sharing. Carr and Dean (2013: 69-71) argue that it was in this context-a confluence of budgetary concerns and the succession of Abbott to the Liberal leadership, with his combative political style-that a new discourse developed to make the case for greater defence spending.",

Carr and Dean (2013: 73) argue that, while the historical GDP comparison was in fact a 'gross distortion and misrepresentation' and unhelpful to understanding the strategic funding requirements, it was a powerful political tool and found resonance in among the public: 'the spectre of 1938 allowed the public \u2026 to conjure up images of the period just prior to the Second World War \u2026 commonly associated with defence unpreparedness during an era of intense escalating threats'. In the leadup to the 2013 election, both parties committed to a spending target of 2% of GDP for defence, despite the impracticality of linking funding that should be determined by strategic analysis and force analysis to a predetermined, volatile amount (Thomson 2016: 68) . The 2016 white paper maintains the 2% budget commitment-largely in response to both public sentiment and U.S. pressure-with the important caveat that 'the 10-year funding model set out in this defence white paper will not be subject to any further adjustments as a result of changes in Australia's GDP growth estimates' (Department of Defence 2016: 36).",

As Thomson (2016: 70-71) notes in an overview of the challenges facing the government as it seeks to fund and deliver the 2016 defence white paper, 'for the time being, private financial concerns appear to be foremost in people's minds, and the fractiousness of the electorate guarantees that politicians will be attentive to these concerns. For that reason, future governments will face far greater difficulties in ramping up defence spending than the Howard government did in the halcyon days of the 2000s'.

The answer rests in the public's perceptions of the threats that exist to Australia, which we deal with in a number of the chapters that follow. What is clear is that threat perceptions have declined consistently since the end of the Cold War and with it, the belief that defence has a greater priority for public expenditure than health, education or pensions. To the extent that there are major threats to Australia, they are viewed as not of the type that defence is trained or equipped to deal with, such as terrorism and natural disasters.

The estimates show the proportions who said that Australia could defend itself if attacked, and who believed that defence was stronger now than it was 10 years ago. For both questions there is a significant increase in positive responses after 2001, most notably for the view that defence had become stronger; in 1998 just 23% took this view, increasing to 31% in 2001 and peaking at 57% in 2009. While optimism about defence capability declined after 2009, since 2013 it has been stable.

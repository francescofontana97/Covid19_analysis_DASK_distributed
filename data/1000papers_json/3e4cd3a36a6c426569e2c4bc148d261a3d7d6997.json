Case Summary -A 3-day-old Thoroughbred foal presented with a 24-hour history of diarrhea and depression. Coronavirus particles were observed in the feces via electron microscopy. During hospitalization the foal developed hyperglycemia concomitantly with low insulin concentration and an adequate response to exogenous insulin therapy supported a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus. The foal required SC insulin for 26 days, but developed complications associated with insulin therapy that resolved with appropriate care. On follow up assessment the foal was found to be a healthy euglycemic animal with normal insulin concentration at 11 months of age. New or Unique Information Provided -To our knowledge this is the first report of Type 1 diabetes in this age group and the first report of transient neonatal diabetes mellitus in horses. Type 1 diabetes mellitus should be considered a differential diagnosis for hyperglycemia in equine neonates and that it can be transient and managed successfully.

A high specific gravity in a foal usually suggests dehydration with intact renal tubular function; although in this case glucosuria was likely a component of the increase in the specific gravity. After the initial fluid therapy the foal was given boluses of LRS (500 mL, IV, q 4 h) until renal values and plasma electrolytes were rechecked after 20 hours. Physical examinations, PCV, and total plasma protein measurements were performed every 6 hours. Fluid therapy was then adjusted to provide maintenance requirements and to balance losses through the feces while considering milk intake. The amount (500-750 mL, q 3-6 h) and type of fluids were chosen based on the plasma electrolytes, hydration, and acid-base status. Fluids were supplemented with sodium bicarbonate or sodium chloride. The supplementation was mainly due to hyponatremia that was likely caused by a combination of losses due to diarrhea and hyperosmolar hyponatremia due to the hyperglycemia. Sodium concentration increased slowly and was 134 mEq/L on Day 9 of hospitalization. Fluid therapy was continued for 12 days after which the diarrhea resolved and fluids were discontinued.",

It was thought that obtaining a glucose curve could help guide and monitor the effects of therapy. Blood glucose was 20.92 mmol/L (377 mg/dL) when the insulin was administered. The foal developed labored breathing and an increased temperature 39.21C (102.61F) almost immediately after the insulin was given. The BG decreased to 9.6 mmol/L (173 mg/ dL) 1 hour after insulin administration, to 5.21 mmol/L (94 mg/dL) 2 hours after insulin administration, and increased progressively after that. The foal was given flunixin meglumine j (1.1 mg/kg, IV once) and monitored closely. The fever and increased respiratory rate persisted for 6 hours. The adverse reaction occurred previous to the lowest concentration of glucose and persisted for longer than the drop in BG. Therefore it was considered unlikely that the increased temperature and respiratory effort was due to changes in glycemia and an adverse reaction to regular insulin was suspected. Subsequently the foal was reverted back to PZI therapy and regular insulin was discontinued as a treatment option. The interval between PZI treatments was gradually prolonged, as it took longer for the blood glucose to rise subsequent to each insulin administration. Insulin therapy was discontinued after Day 31 of hospitalization.",

Hyperglycemia in sick neonates is not well understood but has been related with insufficient insulin secretion, failure of insulin to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis, or insulin resistance of peripheral tissues. 4 Regular insulin can be administered as a constant rate infusion (CRI) or may be provided as SC or IV injections. Initial infusion rates of 0.0133 IU/kg/h and increasing by 0.002 IU/kg/h every 6 hours until blood glucose concentrations return to normal have been described. 4 For repeated injections the reported dosage is 0.1 to 0.5 IU/kg of regular insulin given SC or IV 2,4 or PZI 0.15-0.3 IU/kg SC, every 12 hours. 5 In this case the insulin therapy was designed with the goal to control the glycemia and extend progressively the interval of administration so the foal could have a regimen that did not require intensive management. A CRI of insulin, to more accurately control the glycemia, could have been planned but the foal was bright alert and nursing and a CRI would have not allowed the foal to remain with the mare continuously; furthermore prolonged intensive care was not an option financially.",

Low insulin concentrations accompanying hyperglycemia and an adequate response to exogenous insulin supports a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus. To our knowledge Type 1 diabetes mellitus has been reported in the scientific literature in adult horses 10 but never in a neonate. Additional insulin concentration measurements would have been informative to characterize the progression of the disease. These were not obtained due to monetary constraints.",

Neonatal diabetes is rare (1 case per 300,000-500,000 human births) 11 and 2 main groups are recognized: transient NDM and permanent NDM, which differ in the duration of insulin dependence. 12 A high percentage of children with transient NDM relapse and develop Type 2 diabetes years after the initial hyperglycemic period. 11 Hyperosmolarity, dehydration, and ketone bodies production can cause clinical signs in hyperglycemic individuals. The severity is typically proportional to the degree and duration of the hyperglycemia. 13 Serious consequences of uncontrolled hyperglycemia include hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis. 14 It has been speculated that ketone-producing pathways are relatively unimportant in the horse 15 and diabetic ketoacidosis may therefore be less likely in diabetic horses. The fact that the horse was treated with IV fluids, the hyperglycemia was not prolonged, and diabetes was Type 1 could have prevented nonketotic syndrome or other severe signs.",

Coronavirus has been identified as a cause of pancreatic damage in other species. 16, 17 Viruses may cause direct damage to the pancreas or induce autoimmunity via several mechanisms. There may be an infection of the pancreas, local damage, and activation of bystander T cells, or immunological crossreactivity (molecular mimicry) 18 although the diabetogenic process is unproven. 19 We hypothesize that the coronavirus may have resulted in both the diarrhea and subsequent pancreatic injury in this foal, resulting in transient diabetes mellitus, which resolved as the injury to the pancreas resolved over a period of several weeks. Even though markers of pancreatic injury were normal, they were measured several days after the speculated insult. We are also unaware of the sensitivity of clinicopathologic tests (or sonography) to demonstrate pancreatic injury in horses. Therefore we consider that pancreatic damage due to coronavirus infection is a plausible hypothesis.",

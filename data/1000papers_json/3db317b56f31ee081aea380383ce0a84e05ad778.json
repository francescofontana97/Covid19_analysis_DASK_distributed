Residents, as part of the medical staff, have an ethical obligation to provide clinical care to all patients.

Consequently, hospitals, especially in the public sector, closed down all or some parts of the routine non-emergent services to make available resources and personnel for managing Covid-19 patients. This was also important to avoid making hospitals giant hotbeds of transmission by limiting the visits of patients not requiring urgent care. However, Neurosurgery, being an emergency branch, needs to continue to function as critically ill patients will present with emergent indications, including but not limited to -aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarct, parenchymal hypertensive bleed with raised intracranial pressure (ICP), malignant brain tumors with mass effect, tumors with bleed [3] , cystic degeneration in craniopharyngioma and pituitary apoplexy (both with rapidly deteriorating vision), subacute and chronic subdural hematomas, cauda equina syndrome. An intelligent and need-based utilization of the available resources hence becomes important [4] .",

This is in accordance with the government guidelines for the optimal utilization of the resources [6] . A screening questionnaire is administered to all patients arriving in the Emergency department. Thermal screening is done for all patients and hospital staff. While this is necessary, it is only the bare minimum and hence, personal protective measures remain more important. All HCWs have been instructed to follow universal precautions such as frequent hand hygiene, social distancing measures, and the use of appropriate masks based on their risk exposure. Neurosurgical residents are frequent visitors to the Emergency and ICU departments and must strictly adhere to these guidelines for their protection and that of other patients under their care.",

Intra-and peri-operative practices have also undergone a change. Even if a patient passes the screening criteria or is tested once and found to be negative, he/she can by no means be considered entirely safe. Screening questionnaires have their own fallacies while the RT-PCR tests done for SARS-CoV2 have a high false negative rate [8] . Hence, all appropriate precautions need to be taken for every surgical procedure performed. In our hospital, surgeons are now instructed to enter the operating room (OR) only after the patient has been intubated and exit before removal of the endotracheal tube to avoid exposure to aerosols. Such distancing may make conscious and alert patients more anxious in the peri-operative period since they enter the intimidating operating room environment without the familiar face of their neurosurgeon being around them.",

In our hospital, the number of emergency procedures has marginally increased since routine ORs have been shut and all necessary procedures are performed only on an emergency basis. The department has divided neurosurgical procedures into Emergency, Semi-emergency, and Non-emergency categories to triage [4] . Only emergency and some semi-emergency (based on patient's clinical condition) procedures have been performed in last 8 weeks since India instituted a strict lockdown and routine hospital services were closed. In spite of this optimization process, we have performed a total of 41 procedures in 8 weeks, which is higher than our department's monthly average of 15-20 emergency surgeries. We believe that this may be due to more patients reporting to a tertiary public-sector hospital such as ours, since private and corporate hospitals have also curtailed their routine work due to non-availability of appropriate resources and testing facilities. This provides a continual learning and operative opportunity for trainees in teaching hospitals. Moreover, attendings who are part of the working team have more time and freedom to educate and assist surgical trainees during this period.",

Since the number of working faculty and residents is less at any given time, those on duty have to shoulder the entire burden: managing in-patients, telephonic consultations, emergency consults, and emergency surgeries. An already-rigorous residency program hence becomes even more perplexing if the number of neurosurgical emergencies remains the same or even marginally increases. There have also been reports of increased threat perception and emotional disturbance among residents during this pandemic [11] . Moreover, residents are always required to keep track of their research and academic work since the residency period remains finite, and proficiency expectations from a trainee at the end of this period would not change.

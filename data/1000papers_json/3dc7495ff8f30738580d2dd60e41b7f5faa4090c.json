Zhou et al., 2020) . However, the 319 coronavirus strains isolated from animals seem to be more closely related to SARS-CoV-2. The high diversity of coronaviruses is attributable to their potentially high mutation there were 40 which changed the biochemical properties of the amino acid, and could 471 therefore be associated with better virus adaptation. This is consistent with the study of higher translational efficiencies for the Type II strains than for Type I. This enabled faster 474 production of Type II virus particles resulting in easier spread and leading to its becoming the 475 dominant strain, implying that Type II is more transmissible than Type I. This might explain 476 why Type II strains were more prevalent in Wuhan. All these results suggest that CoV (RaTG13), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of this pangolin virus is identical to that 528 of SARS-CoV-2 in all 6 of the key amino acids. It is highly probable that the bat virus jumped 529 to humans several months before the outbreak was detected, but was not highly infectious. 530 Some studies proved that substitution of one or more amino acids in S protein is enough for ",

It seems that bats and birds, the warm blooded 280 flying vertebrates, are ideal hosts for the coronavirus gene source, bats mainly for 281 alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, while birds for gammacoronaviruses and 282 deltacoronaviruses (P. C. Y. Woo et al., 2012; Yin & Wunderink, 2018). However, 283 coronaviruses or coronavirus-like infections have also been reported in swine, cattle, horses, 284 cats, dogs, rats, ferrets, rabbits and various wildlife species, often being asymptomatic (Gong 285 et al., 2017; Pratelli, 2008; Saif, 2004; Z.

However, betacoronaviruses also include dangerous SARS-CoV 290 responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic 2002 -2003 (Ksiazek et al., 291 2003) and MERS-CoV which caused Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012 and 2017 292 (",

These genomic 414 characteristics create a high diversity of coronaviruses, and allow for rapid change and 415 adaptation to novel hosts (mainly due to mutations in spike proteins), ecological niches, tissue 416 tropism, and even generation of novel coronavirus species sometimes causing major zoonotic 417 outbreaks with disastrous consequences (Bolles et al., 2011; Duffy, 2018; Lau et al., 2018; P.",

Analysis421 of receptor binding and the pathogenesis of SARS suggests that SARS-CoV was most likely 422 generated in bats through sequential recombination of bat SARS related coronaviruses, and 423 that this recombination occurred in bats before coronavirus infected civets or other mammals 424 (Lau et al., 2015). The introduced SARS-CoV underwent rapid mutations in S and ORF8 and 425 successfully spread in market civets. After several independent spillovers to humans, some of 426 the strains underwent further mutations in S protein and became epidemic during the SARS 427 outbreak 2002 -2003. The same situation applies to MERS. The natural reservoirs of MERS-428 CoV (or an ancestral MERS-like CoV) are bats. It is hypothesized that bat MERS-like CoV 429 jumped to camels several decades ago, then the virus evolved and adapted with accumulating 430 mutations in camels, which has then been transmitted to humans very recently (B. Hu et al., 431 2015). A study of Sabir et al. demonstrated that dromedary camels share three species of 432 coronavirus with humans and therefore they serve as an important reservoir for the 433 maintenance and diversification of the MERS-CoVs and are the source of human infections 434 with this virus (Sabir et al., 2016).",

After437 introduction to a human organism (probably some months before December 2019) a mutation in the virus took place, this enabled human-to-human transmission, which then became the 439 main route of the virus spreading. However, based on current evidence, it is possible that the 440 market was not the original source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans (Mackenzie & 441 Smith, 2020; W.-B. Yu et al., 2020). The results of Zhang et al. (L. Zhang et al., 2020) 442 suggest the outbreak of type II COVID-19 likely occurred in the Huanan market, while the 443 initial transmission of the type I virus to humans probably occurred at a different location in 444 Wuhan. Genomes of type I and II differ only in three sites: 8750, 28112 and 29063 (based on 445 the genome coordinates MN938384.1), and the corresponding nucleotides are T, C and T/C in 446 type I, and C, T and C in Type II, respectively. Type I can be further divided into type IA and 447 IB based on the nucleotide at the site 29063. The authors demonstrated that the three sites in 448Type IA and two in Type IB are identical to those in BatCoV RaTG13, suggesting that Type I 449 may be more closely related to the ancestral human-infecting strain than Type II. Type IA 450 seems to be the earliest transmission source, but it did not occur in the Huanan Market [Figure 4514].",

Yu et al., 2020) 456 identified 58 haplotypes in 93 viral genomes. By comparing these to the bat-RaTG13-CoV 457 genome as the outgroup, they found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as 458 ancestral haplotypes, and that H1 was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3. It should 459 be noted that all samples from the Huanan Market belonged to H1 or its derived haplotypes, 460 but none of the available market samples encoded H3 haplotype. This suggests that H3 461 haplotype might have originated and spread outside the market before an early stage of 462 population expansion. The non-synonymous mutation from H3 to H1 would probably have 463 enhanced the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2, infected humans would have transmitted the H1 464 haplotype of SARS-CoV-2 to workers or sellers in the market. The crowded market boosted 465 rapid transmission of haplotype H1 to buyers at an early stage of human-to-human 466 transmission so the virus had spread to the whole city in early December 2019. Such an 467 explanation is supported by other findings of the authors (W.-B. Yu et al., 2020), who 468 reported 120 substitution sites associated with 119 codons, among which 79 were non-469 synonymous and 40 synonymous substitutions.

            "text": "The means of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells is similar to SARS-CoV. In both cases it 481 requires the recognition of a host receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)482    and its binding with the spike S protein, but in the case of SARS-CoV-2 the affinity of S 483 protein to the receptor is 10-fold to 20-fold higher (Yun Chen et al., 2020; Zheng, 2020). As 484 well as for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 is also the receptor for SARS-CoV and HCoVNL63 (Table485 1) (Cui et al., 2019; W. Li et al., 2003; Qiu et al., 2020). This surface molecule is localized on 486 arterial and venous endothelial cells, arterial smooth muscle cells, epithelia of the small 487 intestine and epithelia of the respiratory tract, however, the highest expression of ACE2 is in 488 lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine, causing these tissues and 489 relevant organs to be the most sensitive to infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Perlot & Penninger, 490 2013; Yin & Wunderink, 2018). The presence of ACE2 was confirmed in pangolin, cat, cow, 491 buffalo, goat, sheep and pigeon, which provided ample opportunity for the interspecies 492 transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 from bats both to and among these animals (Qiu et al., 493 2020). Moreover, any of these animals might serve as an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2. 494 This should be taken into account in the control of COVID-19. 495 It has already been reported that a live SARS-like coronavirus isolated from bat fecal 496 samples (bat SL-CoV-WIV1), which has typical coronavirus morphology, used ACE2 from 497 humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry (Ge et al., 2013). These results 498 provide the strongest evidence that bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV. In addition to 499 the recent results on MERS-CoV in a Saudi Arabian bat, and of bat CoVs closely related to 500 MERS-CoV in China, Africa, Europe and North America, these results also suggested that bat 501 coronaviruses remain a substantial global threat to public health. Moreover, cell entry studies 502 of Hu et al. demonstrated that three newly identified SARS-CoVs with different S protein 503 sequences were able to use human ACE2 as the receptor. It means that they are close to 504 becoming infectious to humans, so we should be prepared for future SARS-like disease 505 outbreaks (B. Hu et al., 2017). There are several hypotheses on how coronaviruses are transmitted to humans (Han et 507 al., 2015). The first holds that bats, which are the virus reservoir, contaminate fruit or plants 508 with virus from their saliva, feces or urine, these fruit or plants are then consumed by 509 intermediate hosts, such as pigs, horses and nonhuman primates; while humans are infected 510 by direct contact with animals, or by consuming products of the intermediate animal hosts. 511 Coronavirus particles were detected in, among others, the saliva, milk and feces of infected 512 animals, which are often asymptomatic, and therefore can be transmitted to humans (Azhar et 513 al., 2014; Guan et al., 2003; Killerby et al., 2020; Saif, 2004; Z. Shi & Hu, 2008; Neeltje van 514 Doremalen et al., 2014; L.-F. Wang & Anderson, 2019). SARS-CoV-2 genomic material has 515 been also found in sewage (Medema et al., 2020) and river water (Guerrero-Latorre et al., 516 2020). Aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from bat feces to humans is also possible 517 (Franklin & Bevins, 2020). Coronaviruses can also be transmitted to humans directly from 518 bats via bites or scratches, or by eating bat meat (a practice still popular in China) which has 519 been undercooked (Chan et al., 2013; Han et al., 2015; G. Lu et al., 2015; P. C. Woo et al., 520 2006; Xu et al., 2020). Also in the case of SARS-CoV some evidence indicates that eating 521 meals prepared from infected palm civets could be one of the ways that the virus jumps to 522 humans (Bolles et al., 2011; Hilgenfeld & Peiris, 2013; Lam et al., 2020; L.-F. Wang et al., 523 2006; M. Wang et al., 2005). When the COVID-19 outbreak was analyzed, some papers 524 indicated pangolin as a source of the virus, as pangolin are used not only for their meat but 525 also for traditional Chinese medicine (Guan et al., 2003; Ye et al., 2020). Although the whole 526 genome sequences of CoVs isolated from pangolin are less similar to SARS-CoV-2 than bat 527",

It is well documented that bats, pangolins, civets and other animals were sold in the 536 Wuhan 'wet market' where the COVID-19 pandemic started. 537 It is also worth considering the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 spillover from infected 538 humans to domestic animals and native wildlife that could subsequently serve as new 539 reservoir hosts for the virus and enable the virus spillback into the human population. The viral dissemination from human feces into the environment could have occurred via the 541 wastewater treatment system. Although the impact on livestock and wildlife health is yet 542 unknown, spillover events of zoonotic links are frequent in the Coronaviridae family 543 (Franklin & Bevins, 2020). It is not known whether wildlife species can serve as reservoir 544 hosts for SARS-CoV-2, but recent research on domestic animals indicates that ferrets and cats 545 are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, which then replicated efficiently and was transmissible to 546 na\u00efve cats via droplet transmission (J. Shi et al., 2020). Another risk associated with the 547 establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in a wildlife host population is the possibility of the formation 548 of novel virus variants by mutation in novel hosts or by recombination of SARS-CoV-2 with 549 other bat coronaviruses (Franklin & Bevins, 2020).",

This indicates that not only the respiratory system but 559 also the digestive system are potential routes of infection (H. Zhang et al., 2020; J. Zhou et al., 560 2017). It is also worth adding that the intestinal symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 may be associated 561 with affected enterocytes expressing ACE2. The ACE2 receptor (for humans hACE2), besides 562 being the receptor for some coronaviruses, is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell 563 membranes) of cells in various organs of the body, it lowers blood pressure by catalyzing the 564 cleavage of angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor peptide) into angiotensin 1-7 (a vasodilator) 565 (Letko et al., 2020). Studies carried out during previous epidemics of coronaviruses, mainly 566 SARS-CoV, indicate that, on the one hand, the presence of the virus in the entire 567 gastrointestinal tract (biopsy and feces results even in discharge patients) may be a factor 568 responsible for gastrointestinal symptoms in patients and a potential relapse of the disease (Gu 569 et al., 2020). On the other hand, it is possible to transfer and spread the virus through non-570 droplet transmission. This was also confirmed by cases of SARS-CoV-2 described in the 571 United States (Holshue et al., 2020) and in Hubei (Y. Zhang et al., 2020). Detailed patient 572 tests showed significant gastrointestinal discomfort and the presence of the virus in both the 573 respiratory tract and feces (Holshue et al., 2020; Zang et al., 2020). It is worth recalling that vomiting or flushing the toilet can generate the aerosols causing 575 subsequent airborne transmission (Johnson et al., 2013; Knowlton et al., 2018). Spreading the 576 virus through aerosolization and vaporization of fecal waste water has been demonstrated for 577 adenoviruses and torque teno virus as they have already been detected in aerosols surrounding 578 toilets (Verani et al., 2014). But some recent studies suggest that coronavirus can also be 579 spread by feces aerosolization contaminating various surfaces (Z.-D. Guo et al., 2020; 580 McDermott et al., 2020). Furthermore, according to recent opinions, the monitoring of 581 municipal wastewater for the presence of the virus may enable prediction of a new outbreak a 582 few days before symptoms occur (Mao et al., 2020). This method is much cheaper than 583 genetic tests of people. All this means that proper hygiene is essential to stop SARS-CoV-2 584 from spreading as virions can also contaminate the hands and clothes of people managing 585 food. 586 Data collected in February 2020 by researchers in Hong Kong confirmed that 587 approximately 18% of patients with COVID-19 in the study group showed gastrointestinal 588 symptoms (Cheung et al., 2020). However, virus RNA was detected in the stool samples of 589 over 48% of patients. Fecal RNA was detected even in cases with a negative result for 590 respiratory samples. The relationship between infections/respiratory manifestations and the 591 gastrointestinal tract is not fully understood, but it is known that patients with respiratory tract 592 infections usually show bowel dysfunction or secondary bowel complications that are 593 associated with a more severe clinical course of the disease, which clearly indicates a cross 594 An infected person when coughing emits about 3,000 droplet nuclei, while one sneeze 743 produces up to 40,000 droplets (Tang et al., 2006). During normal breathing, exhalation can 744 project droplets up to 1 m in room air, which may be inhaled by another person nearby 745 causing disease development. The infectivity of such aerosol depends on many factors, with 746 the size of infectious particles being the main agent. The World Health Organization and other 747 agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, use a dichotomous 748 classification between large vs small droplets and droplets vs aerosol. Accordingly, larger 749 droplets (> 10 \u00b5m) with more mass are more strongly influenced by gravity but less so by air 750 flows, so they move more 'ballistically' and fall to the ground more quickly, usually within a 751 distance < 1 m. Small infectious droplets (5 \u00b5m -10 \u00b5m) are less influenced by gravity and 752 can travel a distance of about 1 m -1.5 m. Droplet nuclei (the airborne residue of a potentially 753 infectious aerosol from which most of the liquid has evaporated) measuring < 5 \u00b5m Larger 754 droplets (>10 \u00b5m) with more mass are more strongly influenced by gravity while less by air 755 flows, so they move more 'ballistically' and fall to the ground more quickly, usually in the 756 distance of up to approx. 1 m. Small infectious droplets (5 \u00b5m -10 \u00b5m) are less influenced by 757 gravity and can travel a distance of about 1 m -1.5 m. Droplet nuclei <5 \u00b5m in size (the 758 airborne residue of a potentially infectious aerosol from which most of the liquid has 759 evaporated) can remain suspended in the air very long and can be carried even 50 m by air 760 flows as a 'cloud'. Viruses usually enter the respiratory tract in small droplets and droplet 761 nuclei (Atkinson et al., 2009; Fernstrom & Goldblatt, 2013; Infection Prevention and Control 762 of Epidemic-and Pandemic-Prone Acute Respiratory Infections in Health Care, 2014; Liu et 763 al., 2020; Tang et al., 2006). 764 However, recent work has demonstrated that exhalations, sneezes and coughs are 765 primarily made of a multiphase turbulent gas cloud (a puff) that entrains ambient air which 766 traps and carries within it droplets of all sizes (Bourouiba, 2020). Moreover, the moist and 767 warm atmosphere within the turbulent gas cloud protects the pathogen-bearing droplets 768 against evaporation for much longer than occurs with isolated droplets, hence, the lifetime of 769 droplets within a 'puff' could be extended to many minutes. Depending on environmental 770 conditions (temperature and humidity) the gas cloud with pathogen-loaded droplets of all 771 sizes can travel 7m -8m and be either directly inhaled by a susceptible person, contaminate 772 other rooms via the ventilation system or settle on various surfaces and fomites.",

Furthermore, several ways to prevent viral contamination can be adjusted particularly 815 to food or their packaging. Firstly, food safety procedures that are already known and used to 816 prevent pathogen contamination, such as washing and disinfecting hands, surfaces and all 817 utensils that come into contact with food or applying appropriate processing temperatures, 818 should still be implemented (COVID-19 and Food Safety, 2020a).

Some coronavirus isolates obtained from human samples (Wuhan hospital patients) have an 86.9% nucleotide sequence identity to that of a bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate: bat-SL-CoVZC45 genome (MG772933.1) (Zhu et al., 2020). Wu et al. (F. Wu et al., 2020)follows that coronavirus transmission between animals in Chinese 'wet markets' was very plausible, especially so as the live animals kept in cages were stressed and therefore practicing poor hygiene standards. Animal-to-human transmission requires either direct contact or occurs through objects/food contaminated with animal feces, urine, blood or aerosols (L.-F.Wang et al., 2006). To infect a new host species, coronaviruses must adapt to the receptor of their new host. This can occur either by mutation or by recombination with a coronavirus infecting their new host. Bats harbor coronaviruses with great genetic diversity, and they are considered a main reservoir of mammalian coronaviruses (Fan et al., 2019; B. Hu et al., 2015). It is believed that most currently circulating alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses in different mammals are linked by evolution to ancestral coronaviruses originating from bats. Coronaviruses have a strong history of host shifting, and many HCoVs are recognized as having an animal reservoir. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that bovine CoV (BCoV) was the origin for HCoV-OC43 following a relatively recent cross-species transmission event. The natural reservoir of MERS-CoV is presumed to be in dromedary camels, from which zoonotic transmissions repeatedly give rise to infections of the lower respiratory tract in humans 386 (Hulswit et al., 2016). Some data suggests that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from 387 (SADS) was observed in pigs in Guangdong province, with a mortality rate of up to 90% for piglets 5 days or younger. A novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus (SADS-CoV) was identified as the agent causing the disease, and it was revealed that isolates were almost identical (95%)with Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 (Cui et al., 2019).",

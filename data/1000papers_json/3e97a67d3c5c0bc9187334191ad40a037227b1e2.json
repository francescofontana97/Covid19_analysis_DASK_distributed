In order to assist medical personnel to achieve an efficient and fast diagnosis of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia, this paper proposes an assisted diagnosis algorithm based on ensemble deep learning. e method combines the Stacked Generalization ensemble learning with the VGG16 deep learning to form a cascade classifier, and the information constituting the cascade classifier comes from multiple subsets of the training set, each of which is used to collect deviant information about the generalization behavior of the data set, such that this deviant information fills the cascade classifier. e algorithm was experimentally validated for classifying patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, patients with common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls, and the algorithm achieved a prediction accuracy of 93.57%, sensitivity of 94.21%, specificity of 93.93%, precision of 89.40%, and F1-score of 91.74% for the three categories. e results show that the method proposed in this paper has good classification performance and can significantly improve the performance of deep neural networks for multicategory prediction tasks.",

As of January 2021, the World Health Organization issued a bulletin showing that the cumulative number of confirmed cases worldwide exceeds 91 million, the cumulative number of deaths exceeds 1.9 million deaths, and up to 300,000 new confirmed cases per day, and artificial intelligence methods are one of the important tools for the diagnosis of clinical novel coronavirus pneumonia [1, 2] . In clinical practice, etiological tests including sputum, pharyngeal swabs, and lower respiratory secretions, such as reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and gene sequences, are the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and nucleic acid testing is widely considered to be the main criterion for discharge after treatment. However, the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19 is dramatically increasing, and a large number of COVID-19 infections are being confirmed every day. Diagnostic methods of nucleic acid testing are faced with long waiting times for test results, certain false negatives, and shortage of testing reagents, and CT image analysis of the chest is also considered an important adjunctive diagnostic tool. For example, almost all patients with COVID-19 have some typical radiological features of chest CT, including ground-glass opacities, multifocal patchy consolidation, and/or interstitial changes in a peripheral distribution [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . erefore, until definitive results are obtained, rapid differentiation of patient type, based on chest CT images, may be a useful tool to improve diagnosis and to better characterise disease effects.",

Deep learning discovers distributed feature representations of data by combining lower-level features to form more abstract higher-level representations of attribute categories or features . Researchers have made  important research progress in previous work by implementing deep learning algorithms to predict and classify  pneumonia such as COVID-19 based on chest medical  images and other biological indicators. According to Table 1 , the existing studies on COVID-19 face the following problems: Wang [10] used a three-dimensional deep neural network to classify COVID-19 and a weakly supervised approach to localize lesion regions by combining the activated regions and unsupervised connected components in the classification network, obtaining 90.1% accuracy and 95.5% ROC. However, this 3D classification model has problems such as long training time. Han [11] designed an attention mechanism-based pooling method applied to 3D data instance prediction that achieved 97.9% accuracy and 99% AUC in COVID-19, CP, and normal classification tasks, but there are problems of limited test set size, for instance, prediction based on 3D data. HORRY [12] proposed a COVID-19 detection method based on migration learning and multimodal image data, but the performance of the generated classification model is insufficient. Pathak [17] proposed a deep bidirectional long-short memory network with a hybrid density network model (DBM) for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 classification tasks achieving 98.37% accuracy and 98.32% AUC; its dataset size is small with only 1790 sheets. Wang et al. [21] designed an X-ray migration learning and model integration deep learning method for COVID-19, which achieved good results of 96.1% in triclassification prediction tasks, but there are only 140 images of COVID-19 patients in the dataset, and more than 7000 images of common pneumonia patients and normal controls; but this dataset is small and unbalanced.",

Stacking generalization refers to the scheme of providing information from one group of classifiers to another group of classifiers before forming the final prediction result. e prominent feature of stacking generalization is that the information constituting the classifier network comes from multiple subsets of the training set, and the original training set is divided into multiple subsets of training sets. Each subtraining set is used to collect bias information about the generalization behavior of the data set so that this bias information fills the classifier network. Stacking generalization is a method to estimate and correct the deviation from the constituent classifier to the training set provided.",

According to Figure 2 , it can be seen that even the triclassifier trained solely based on the VGG16 model showed good results in identifying neocoronary pneumonia, common pneumonia, and normal controls, while the performance of the cascade model combining the deep neural network and the integrated learning algorithm was significantly improved. e experimental results in this paper show that the cascade classifier constructed by combining the deep learning algorithm with the integrated learning algorithm can significantly improve the multiclassification prediction accuracy of the model. According to Figure 3 , it can be seen that among the prediction results using only the triclassifier M31, the normal control group is predicted as common pneumonia and new coronary pneumonia is predicted as common pneumonia, and these two false predictions occur more frequently, with the false prediction rates of 14.43% and 12.47%, respectively. For these two classification cases with high error rates, two classifiers M24 and M25 with prediction performance over 95% were trained in this paper by the subtraining sets U5 and U6 for improving the predictions with high error rates, and the number of these two errors was significantly reduced to 1.99% and 7.20%, respectively, thus greatly improving the prediction accuracy of the normal control group and new coronary pneumonia, especially new coronary pneumonia identified as normal pneumonia was greatly reduced in the error rate. In the cascade classifier, the number of discrimination errors increases when the original discrimination errors are less, such as judging normal control as new coronary pneumonia and judging new coronary pneumonia as the normal control group. As can be seen from Figure 2 , the incorrect discrimination error rate of judging normal pneumonia as neocoronary pneumonia only increased from 0.27% to 0.78%, and there was no significant increase in the incorrect discrimination rate.",

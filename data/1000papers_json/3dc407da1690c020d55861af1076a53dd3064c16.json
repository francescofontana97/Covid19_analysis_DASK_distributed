Noncoding RNAs in particular, however, often do not exhibit conservation at the sequence level but do display conservation at the structural level. Compensatory mutations of the bases in an RNA alignment are a signature of this structural-level conservation. (By 'compensatory mutations' we mean substitutions of both the sites involved in a base-pair, such that canonical Watson-Crick or wobble base-pairing is maintained: although we do not know in which order the two substitutions occurred, we presume that the second substitution 'compensated' for the first.) When eyballing an RNA alignment to determine if it includes a structural ncRNA, it is extremely helpful to have a visual indicator of such mutations.",

Experienced analysts spend a lot of time at the command line in an X11, VT100 or other terminal window, which (for an expert) is usually the most interactive way to work. However, extra interactivity is also starting to show up in 'Web 2.0' applications via dynamic HTML technologies such as Javascript/AJAX. An example of this migration of command-line workflow to a Javascript-led interface is the heavily Unix-influenced web application 'Yahoo Pipes': http://pipes.yahoo.com/ To analyze RNA effectively we needed visualization tools that matched all three parts of our workflow: command-line terminal hackery, static HTML page browsing and smart AJAX components. We also found that a variety of coloring paradigms is effective. Here, we describe three tools-Colorstock, SScolor and Rato\u00b4n-that grew from these needs.",

An alignment analysis between viral and human proteins was carried out with the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI's) Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). BLAST is useful to infer functional and evolutionary relationships between proteins and it is commonly applied to characterize newly determined sequences, but it might draw an incomplete picture of peptide sharing of immunological relevance because it might miss identical amino acid sequences shared by non-homologous regions of the compared proteins. 2, 3 The BLAST parameters include indeed an 'expect value threshold' that is meant to correct for possible matches due to chance. 2 Although this correction is necessary when comparing protein sequences for homology and biological relationship, it has to be set arbitrarily and might discard matches that do not reflect an evolutionary relationship between organisms and proteins but nevertheless can be related to cross-reactive immunological phenomena. The stringency of such analysis also depends on other parameters that are chosen.",

[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Moreover, sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and human GBSrelated proteins was even found with BLAST, and this can possibly be explained by parameter setting differences. 9 Of course, protein sequence comparisons do not take into account two other potential targets of cross-reactivity: nonpeptidic and discontinuous protein epitopes, but this approach would go beyond the intended purpose of the analysis presented by Keddie and colleagues. 1 The methodological issue that we describe here should be pointed out, but may not necessarily affect the conclusion of the paper on the lack of definitive evidence of a link between COVID-19 and GBS, and we do agree with the authors that further basic and clinical research is needed to possibly turn the absence of evidence into actual evidence of absence. 10 ",

            "text": "The learning environment (LE) provides a context for many educational phenomena, of which wellness and burnout are particularly important. The LE can be thought of as consisting of a psychosocial dimension of personal, social, and organizational factors and a sociomaterial dimension that consists of spatial and technical factors. The interplay between elements of the LE and wellness of the participants is complex and only partially understood, requiring further research. Using this multidimensional model to describe and to plan to deliberately modify the learning environment can foster more rigorous and meaningful research evidence about the interaction of wellness and the LE. This article highlights four key considerations that scholars of wellness should consider when exploring the impact of the LE or designing interventions to modify the environment. These include 1) a thoughtful definition and theoretical conceptualization of the LE, 2) clarity about the study variables that are essential to the study question(s), 3) thoughtful and appropriate measurement of those variables, and 4) a study design that balances quality with feasibility. We provide a practical illustration of how these considerations can be applied in studies exploring the intersection of wellness and the LE.",

This model has two primary dimensions: a psychosocial and a sociomaterial 7-9 dimension. The psychosocial dimension encompasses the key human interactions that define most LEs. There are at least three levels in this dimension: the personal or individual characteristics that contribute to or respond to the LE, the social level encompassing interpersonal interactions of many kinds, and the organizational level of institutional policies, culture, and regulation. The sociomaterial dimension describes how learners interact with the physical and virtual world they learn in. It includes the physical spaces and attributes of buildings and classrooms, such as light, noise, seating arrangements, and temperature. It also includes virtual spaces consisting of information structures and networks, data systems, electronic",

[10] [11] [12] There is little doubt that stress, burnout, depression and other presentations of psycho-emotional distress are common experiences in medical education and practice. 13 Nor is there question about the adverse impacts of these distresses, such as dropping out, forced career change, substance abuse, suicide and depression, and many other phenomena. 14 The COVID pandemic is magnifying these stressors, adding new challenges including ambiguity, isolation-alienation, anxiety and atomization with loss of a sense of community. 15 Opposing these challenges is the concept of wellness, defined by the WHO, as the optimal state of health of individuals and groups. It focuses on both the realization of the fullest potential (life-satisfaction) of an individual physically, psychologically, socially, spiritually and economically and the fulfillment of these individual's roles in family, workplace and community settings. 16 Some would use the term well-being for the above, emphasizing the more static description of an optimal state. Many prefer the term wellness as describing one's awareness and active pursuit of activities, choices and healthy lifestyles to lead to a holistic concept of health, achieving one's full potential. 17 Wellness is a concept that is multi-dimensional, dynamic and still evolving over time. 18 For the sake of our discussion, we have selected a multi-dimensional description of the concept (Figure 2 ) based on Hettler's 19 20 which, as a part of DHHS, serves as the principal agency of the US government, tasked for protecting the health of all Americans. A detailed analysis of multiple other wellness models and several assessment tools is beyond the scope of this article, but the reader is referred to this excellent recent summary. 21 Wellness is influenced by and itself influences many other phenomena, such as resilience 22 or interpersonal interactions, e.g., mentoring, 23, 24 or institutional culture. 25 Clearly, individuals in their pursuit of wellness or building resilience do so not in isolation but influenced by interactions with their social and cultural environments. Thus, one may need to place this active pursuit of wellness in a larger, multidimensional context, which we propose to consider in terms of the learning environment. We argue that the LE influences our learners' chance to achieve wellness in this domain of their life.",

However, the wellness model does not specifically call out virtual spaces or technology as a component of wellness. This might suggest that there is a connection between wellness and the LE that is worth pursuing. Similarly, there are several additional dimensions of wellness (e.g., financial, spiritual, professional) that may fit this in the psychosocial dimension of the LE or may require an expansion of the model to accommodate them. Of course, using alternative models for key constructs will also allow one to shift focus to somewhat different manifestations of wellness. For example, using multiple tenets in their Wheel of Wellness model, Witmer, Sweeney et al. 30 incorporated coping, self-worth, cultural identity, spirituality but also nutrition, self-care, and stress management into their model. Spirituality as a central energy force to engage in the pursuit of wellness is a theme in several holistic modules. 31, 32 Investigating the relationship of spirituality and the LE may require a modification of the LE framework to better address the nature of sacred and meditative environments.",

As a result, many of the published studies of the LE use simple single-group observational designs for qualitative descriptive or quantitative correlational studies. Also, fairly common are comparisons among naturally occurring groups (e.g., institutions, curricula.) Quite uncommon, but essential to providing high-quality research evidence are pre-and post-intervention designs, control-vs-intervention comparisons, or complex statistical modelling designs. The emphasis of these designs is on an intentional, usually prospective intervention. However, the more sophisticated the design, the more complex (and expensive) it becomes to implement.

On this background the program runs the mentoring program (White Box), but its efficiency is deeply intertwined with the particular LE of the program.

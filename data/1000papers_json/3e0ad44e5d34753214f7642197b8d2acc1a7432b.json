Critical care work often presents distressing situations, ethical dilemmas and complex decision making (Scholtz et al., 2016) . The stress of looking after critically ill patients can contribute to burnout syndrome amongst critical care staff (Jones et al., 2020; Vincent et al., 2019) . The consequences are far reaching and include poor staff wellbeing, high sickness rates, poor recruitment and retention rates of highly qualified staff, and high vacancy rates (CC3N, 2018) , with attendant risks for patient safety and quality of care.",

The necessary introduction of non-intensive care unit (ICU) trained staff during the COVID-19 pandemic has added further complexity. This rapid expansion of many ICU's created a situation where qualified intensive care staff were required to support large numbers of staff who had never previously worked in ICU. In turn, non-ICU trained staff also faced similar challenges whilst navigating a new working environment. All these factors together have made ICU a significantly more challenging place to work in 2020. The possibility of subsequent waves of COVID-19 is a sobering thought for those currently working in critical care. This is now a crucial time to consider how best to support critical care staff and those who may be redeployed there and to consider which interventions may help to support staff wellbeing in the current unprecedented situation.",

The programme was based on recognised principles in this field, such as the importance of acknowledging and naming feelings and attending to communication skills.",

Symptoms of anger and irritability have been described in around a third of health workers surveyed in the United Kingdom (UK) during the COVID-19 pandemic (YouGov link). In part this is likely to reflect the increase in anxiety across the general population, but in the context of ICU particularly, may also be associated with fear about the risk of nosocomial transmission of the disease and moral distress felt by staff in relation to their inability to provide optimal care for patients and families. In an emergency, such as a global pandemic, resources are stretched by definition and staff are likely to be further demoralised by the high mortality rate associated with the virus on ICU, which has remained at more than double the rate for influenza (ICNARC, 2020) , no matter how hard they work.",

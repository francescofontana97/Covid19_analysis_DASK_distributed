There is mounting evidence that, in contrast to classical astroviruses, novel HAstV exhibit tropism for the upper respiratory tract. This one-year period prevalence screened all available clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from pediatric patients aged \u22645 years for novel and classical HAstV using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A total of 205 samples were tested; two novel HAstV cases were detected for a prevalence of 1.3%, with viral loads suggesting active upper respiratory tract replication.

            "text": "Classical and novel human astroviruses (HAstV) are nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Astroviridae family. Classical HAstV (serotypes 1-8) are phylogenetically distant from novel HAstV (namely MLB and VA) with amino acid identities being as low as 23% to a maximum of 54.5% depending on the open reading frames. 1 Although classical HAstV are a leading cause of viral gastroenteritis, especially in children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients, 2-4 the clinical manifestations of novel HAstV have not been fully characterized. [5] [6] [7] [8] The spectrum of human diseases for classical and novel HAstV is not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract: both have been reported as causal agents of central nervous system infections. 1 A seroepidemiological study of the novel HAstV MLB1 in the United States suggests that primary infection occurs in childhood, with seropositivity reaching 70%, 90%, and 100% by ages 3, 4-6, and 7-17 years, respectively. 9 A recent survey of classical and novel HAstV in clinical stool samples collected in a tertiary care hospital indicates that, for both viral groups, susceptible populations are young children (\u22644 years) and the immunocompromised patients. 10 Yet, for patients with novel HAstV, stool viral loads are lower and upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms (cough, rhinorrhea, and odynophagia) are more frequent (70%), suggesting a potentially different pathogenic pathway between novel and classical HAstV. Indeed, additional reports of novel HAstV (MLB1, MLB2, and VA1) in pediatric nasopharyngeal specimens continue to emerge. [11] [12] [13] Here, we report the results of a one-year period-prevalence survey of novel and classical HAstV in URT samples collected in pediatric patients in a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland and describe the case presentations of two novel HAstV-positive patients.",

At the time of admission (day 0) in February 2017, he presented with coryza; oxygen saturation and temperature were within normal limits. The retrospective review of the medical record provides no information on the presence of URT symptoms before admission. Subject #2 had no signs of gastrointestinal infection before admission. The nasal discharge persisted, and on day 5 he became febrile (temperature 39.6\u00b0C) and tachypneic (respiratory rate 30-38/minute); on auscultation, diffuse rhonchis were apparent, but oxygen saturation remained within normal limits. Skin examination revealed good wound healing without signs of infection. A chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory workup showed normal C-reactive protein and white blood cell count (9.3 G/L) with elevated bands (17%) and a mild lymphocytopenia (0.74 G/L). On day 6, the patient remained febrile (38.1\u00b0C) without diarrhea or other signs of focal infection apart from persistent coryza. An NPS sample tested negative for influenza A/B and RSV, but was retrospectively positive for picornavirus (Ct = 30) as well as a novel HAstV-MLB1 (4380 RNA copies/mL of viral transport medium). In parallel, a rapid test performed study confirms that novel HAstV can be detected in URT samples among \u22645-year-old children with an estimated prevalence of 1.3%. This prevalence is likely an underestimation considering the relatively low number of URT samples collected at University Hospitals of Geneva in the summer season and the mild respiratory manifestations (cough and rhinorrhea, as previously reported 10 ) for which children are often managed as outpatients and for which further diagnostic testing is rarely performed. Furthermore, a large number of rapid diagnostic tests for influenza A/B and RSV were conducted directly in the pediatric emergency room during the cold season, thereby limiting the number of URT samples sent to the routine laboratory for PCR screening. One hundred forty-six of the 205 NPS samples (71.2%) were collected in the context of URT symptoms, while 55 (26.8%) were collected and screened for respiratory viruses in patients without URT manifestations but according to specific clinical situations (eg, fever of unknown origin, workup, follow-up of transplanted recipients). For four NPS samples, the retrospective review of the medical records did not reveal any information about URT symptoms on the day of sampling. The high HAstV-MLB2 and -MLB1 viral loads estimated in NPS samples of subjects #1 and #2, respectively, support a local viral replication. Nevertheless, the causality of novel HAstV in upper respiratory manifestations cannot be concluded based solely on HAstV detection, particularly given the presence of multiple viral coinfections in these patients. The limitations of this pilot study to clarify the clinical relevance of novel HAstV in URT infections are: q(a) to extend the investigations to all susceptible populations, that is, pediatric and immunocompromised patients (b) although children \u22644 years represents the pediatric-susceptible population, it would be relevant to perform a comparative analysis between the different pediatric age groups (ie, neonates, infants, children, and adolescent) (c) there is a need for prospective case-control studies considering not only the novel HAstV susceptible populations but also the entire pediatric and adult populations with matching respective control groups. This would contribute to the estimation of asymptomatic carriage prevalence.",

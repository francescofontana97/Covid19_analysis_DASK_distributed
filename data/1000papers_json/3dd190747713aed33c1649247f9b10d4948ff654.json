This study aims to investigate visit to which category of places among grocery, retail, parks, workplaces, residential, and transit stations is more associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in India. A longitudinal analysis of generalized estimating equation (GEE) with a Poisson log-linear model is employed to analyze the daily mobility rate and reported new cases of COVID-19 between March 14 and September 11, 2020. This study finds that mobility to places of grocery (food and vegetable markets, drug stores etc.) and retail (restaurants, cafes, shopping centres etc.) is significantly associated (at p<0.01) with the incidence of COVID-19. In contrast, visits to parks, transit stations and mobility within residential neighbourhoods are not statistically significant (p>0.05) in changing COVID-19 cases over time. These findings highlight that instead of blanket lockdown restrictions, authorities should adopt a place-based approach focusing on vulnerable hotspot locations to contain the COVID-19 and any future infectious disease.",

With rapid advancements in transportation systems, our societies have increased reach, speed of travel and human beings are moving in great volumes like never before. The global spread of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2-pathogen, also known as COVID-19 (Chen et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020; Singhal, 2020; Sohrabi et al., 2020; ) that has led to over 70 million infections worldwide as of Mid-December 2020 (WHO, 2020a) is indicative of how mobility can turn into a global health problem in an increasingly globalized world. A popular model adopted across the global regions to curb the rise of infections is enforcing social distancing measures (Cato et al., 2020; Lasry et al., 2020; Lunn et al., 2020; WHO, 2020b; Zhu et al., 2020) , including bans on non-essential travel, stayat-home orders, school closures, and temporary shutdown of offices and businesses.",

The lockdown on 1.38 billion Indians was aimed to enforce strict social distancing and was implemented in four phases over nine weeks (March 25 -May 31). The first three weeks of the lockdown were the most severe with nearly all services and factories suspended across the country (Praharaj and Vaidya, 2020) . During the second phase of the intervention (April 15 -May 3) lockdown areas were classified into three zones -red (indicating infection hotspots), orange (indicating some infection) and green (no cases of COVID-19 . Some relaxations were announced for orange and green zones in this phase, allowing agricultural businesses, banks, and government centres to reopen. The third (May 4 -17) and fourth (May 18 -31) phase of the lockdown was used to further open up activities in the orange zone and to restore normalcy in the green zone. While the number of cases continued to increase in several parts of India since the lockdown was lifted on May 31, 2020, we are yet to understand what impact the mobility restrictions, lockdowns and subsequent reopenings may have had on the evolving scenario of virus spread and the COVID-19 health crisis.",

Given this, it is expected that any changes in mobility will have a lagged effect on the discovery of new cases. To counter this, we calculated the lagged moving averages of the mobility indicators. We created both a 7-day lagged indicator and a 14-day lagged indicator to help understand whether a longer incubation time leads to a different prediction and inventory of COVID-19 cases. The lagged indicators are calculated as the mean of the mobility indicator using the values from date-minus-7-days to date-minus-2-days for the 7-day lagged indicator. Furthermore, it is possible that mobility and reports of new cases of COVID-19 are endogenous, if communities adjust their mobility according to increasing incidence rates (Paez, 2020) . Hence, in addition to being consistent with a scientifically proven incubation period, the use of lagged indicators also helps to break this potential endogeneity.",

The two mobility categories have a positive coefficient (\u03b2) of 0.35 and 0.38, respectively, suggesting that an increase in the covariate will result in an increased number of COVID-19 cases over time. The model, therefore, shows that an increase in mobility to places like shopping centres, grocery markets, restaurants, farmers markets and pharmacies results in an increased number of COVID-19 cases in India. We also discover that the coefficients (B) of parks, transit stations and residential related mobility are not statistically significant (p>0.05), which implies that they do not affect changing COVID-19 cases over time. The test results demonstrate that although workplace-related mobility is significantly associated with the dependent variable (p<0.05), the coefficient value for predicting the relationship is negative. We can hence verify that reports of COVID-19 cases due to workplace-related mobility have reduced over time.

            "text": "This study presents a novel approach to study the relationship between daily mobility and the incidence of COVID-19 using the GEE method. Our statistical model effectively negates the within-subject correlation of responses on dependent variables to produce unbiased parameter estimates for case count data that was not normally distributed. However, there may be some possible limitations/bias in the data used for analysis, and the results of this study should be interpreted in light of those limitations. The dependent variable consists of daily COVID-19 cases by regions. The availability of testing centres and the number of tests performed across states in India varies significantly (Rafiq et al., 2020; Sarkar et al., 2020) . India's testing rate is slightly above 70,000 per million population as of September 11 (the last date for which data is included in this analysis), which is much lower than other COVID-19 worst-hit countries like USA or Brazil, which have conducted over 400,000 tests per million people (WHO, 2020c). Hence, the actual cases in India, overall and across regions, might be much higher than reported COVID-19 positive cases. Also, depending on the late development or non-availability of testing equipment at the early stages of the pandemic, the accuracy of daily new cases might have been affected. With the mobility indicators, a major limitation was that it includes data for select people who use Google products on a smartphone (Aktay et al., 2020) . Therefore, the data might not representatively capture all groups, such as older adults and the low-income population who might not be using smartphones while navigating through different places. The other limitation is to the aggregated number of travels which does not reflect the frequency of travels per person, especially those .

Importantly, the results highlight that the spread of the coronavirus is closely related to the frequency of short-distance travel for daily needs. The crowdedness of local public places like local grocery and retail shops emerged as the likely key factor that drives human-to-human transmission of coronavirus. The local food and vegetable markets in Indian cities are highly unorganised places, and they lack space for proper social distancing. During the lockdown period, the majority of states restricted the operating hours of these markets, and vendors were only allowed to open for a few hours in the morning. These rules may have had an adverse impact, leading to overcrowding of these market areas due to the influx of a large number of people in a limited time period seeking essential food items. Furthermore, these crowded markets are often located within pockets of poverty, suggesting that the socioeconomic dynamics of localities might have influenced how the virus spread through communities. The findings support previous research (Hamidi et al., 2020; Hawkins et al., 2020; , which have established that socioeconomic factors play an important role in COVID-19 prevalence in the USA.",

We also found that blanket lockdown restrictions might not be beneficial, as this research provides evidence that economic activities like commuting to workplaces, which have preventive measures such as social distancing and wearing of masks, do not lead to an increased number of cases. Likewise, we find that visiting low-density open spaces (public parks) does not significantly affect virus spread. Therefore, social distancing, which has been established by the previous researchers (Badr et al., 2020; Cato et al., 2020; Lasry et al., 2020; Singhal, 2020; WHO, 2020c ) as a critical tool in the battle against COVID-19, must be continued to be rigorously implemented in the evolving context of the pandemic to control any subsequent waves of infections. Overall, the results from this study show that initial control measures and lockdown aimed at human mobility reduction had a decent impact on the occurrence of COVID-19 in India. However, given the limited resources available for enforcing extensive lockdowns in a large country and its adverse effects on the economy, authorities should adopt a place-based approach, focusing on promoting and implementing strict social-distancing in hotspot locations that are most vulnerable.",

Using publicly available data from the Occupational Information Network, we classified jobs as being at higher risk of COVID-19 if they require \"moderately close\" physical proximity to other people and cannot be done remotely. 6 We fitted multivariate logistic regression models with robust standard errors to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of living in a household with someone who worked for more than 1 month at a job at higher risk of COVID-19 infection during the period. Estimates were obtained separately for individuals indefined age groups (15-44 years old, 45-64 years old, and 65-85 years old) to account for interactions between age group and other covariates. All analyses were performed using the R programming language (version 4.0.2) and the estimatr and srvyr packages. Personlevel weights were provided by IPUMS. 4 ",

Using nationally representative data, we identified racial/ ethnic groups significantly more likely to live with someone continuing to work at a job at higher risk of COVID-19 infection, in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. These findings build upon earlier work on racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19-related outcomes by demonstrating the combined impact of racial disparities in both occupational and household exposure risk, and shed light on potential contributors. 3 In particular, our findings suggest that racial and ethnic disparities in exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may be drivenby household exposure to someone working a job at higher risk of COVID-19 infection.",

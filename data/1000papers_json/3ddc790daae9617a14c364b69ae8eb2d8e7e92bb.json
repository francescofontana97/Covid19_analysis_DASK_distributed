Later on, these patients tested positive for a new coronavirus. 3 The virus was named as new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by the WHO. This virus was responsible for the COVID-19 disease (new Coron-aVirus Disease). On March 13th, 2020, the Health Secretary of the Spanish Government announced 4209 cases, with a cumulative incidence of notified confirmed cases/100 000 inhabitants of 8.99 4 ( Table 1 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 158, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 378, "end": 379, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 568, "end": 569, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 890, "end": 897, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to bat coronaviruses, and it has been postulated that they are the source of coronavirus pneumonia. Although the origin of COVID-19 is still under study, current tests suggests that spread to humans occurred through transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale market. 5, 6 Complete genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 was different from the beta-coronavirus associated with the human severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics that are typical of the coronavirus family and it has been classified as part of the lineage of beta-coronavirus 2b. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses and have largest genome among the RNA viruses known to this day. The singlestranded, helical genome is enveloped together with a protein (nucleocapsid). There are at least 3 protein structures in the viral envelope: membrane M protein, E protein whose main function is viral assembly and the spike (S) protein involved in virus penetration to attack host cells (Fig. 1) . 7 Both, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, enter the cell through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 first infects the lower respiratory airways and binds to the ACE2 receptor in the alveolar epithelial cells. Both viruses are powerful inflammatory cytokine inducers. The \u00abcytokine storm\u00bb or \u00abcytokine cascade\u00bb is the mechanism that has been postulated as responsible for organ damage. The virus activates immune cells and induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. 8 Compared to previously isolated SARS-CoV strains, SARS-CoV-2 (2019) probably uses the human ACE2 less efficiently than SARS-CoV-2002 but more efficiently than el SARS-CoV-2003. Since the ACE2 binding affinity has proven to be one of the most important determinants of SARS-CoV infectivity, it could be argued that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved in its ability to infect and spread among humans. 9 The epidemiological criteria to define a suspected case, at the end of January 2020, were the following: history of a trip to Wuhan or direct contact with Wuhan patients who had a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days before the onset of the disease. A confirmed case was defined as a case with respiratory samples that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in. at least, 1 of the following 3 methods: isolation of SARS-CoV-2 or, at least, 2 positive results in real-time on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 or a genetic sequence matching SARS-CoV-2. 10 The estimated mean incubation time is approximately 5 days, similar to the mean values already known for the incubation period of SARS and MERS. In addition to proving empirically the comparability of SARS-CoV-2 with other disease-causing coronaviruses, the 95th percentile of the incubation period is between 10 to 14 days, indicative that a 14-day quarantine period would guarantee, to a great extent, the absence of the disease among exposed healthy individuals. 11 COVID-19 has showed quick person-to-person transmission capabilities. Based on the estimation of the basic reproductive number (R0), indicative of the number of individuals that 1 affected case infects during the course of their disease in a population of people who were previously infection-free and have not been vaccinated; R0 for COVID-19 is, on average, 2.2 individuals, that is, every patient has been spreading the disease, on average, to > 2 people. One of the reasons that explains the quick spread may have to do with the atypical symptoms seen during the early stages of the disease in some infected patients. 6 However, it is well-known that the infection seems to have been transmitted during the incubation period too. The fact that asymptomatic patients are potential sources of infection could justify a reassessment of the transmission dynamics of the current outbreak. 12, 13 The best example in this regard was described in a 5-member family that developed pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 in Anyang, China. Before showing any symptoms, they had been in contact with yet another asymptomatic family member who had just returned from the Wuhan epidemic center. The chain of events described suggests that coronavirus can be transmitted by an asymptomatic carrier. The incubation period for this patient was 19 days, which is long, but within the reported range of 0 to 24 days. His first RT-PCR results tested negative; false negative results have been reported as dependent on the quality of the testing kit used, the sample collected or the very performance of the test. The RT-PCR test has been widely used in diagnostic virology and it has yielded few false positive results. This means that it was unlikely that his second RT-PCR result may have been a false positive, so it was used to define the COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 329, "end": 331, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 332, "end": 333, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1127, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1673, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2061, "end": 2062, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2662, "end": 2664, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3131, "end": 3133, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3756, "end": 3757, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 4022, "end": 4025, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 4026, "end": 4028, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1115, "end": 1123, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Epidemiology"}, {"text": "Triage protocols are designed to allocate scarce resources in a fair and transparent manner and in such a way that, by definition, some groups of people are excluded from access to healthcare.

The mean age of the deceased in Italy was 81 years and over two thirds of these patients had diabetes, heart conditions or cancer or were former smokers. Therefore, it is true that these patients had underlying health conditions, but it is also worth pointing out that they had pneumonia related SARS and SARS-CoV-2 related SARS. Of the patients who died, 42.2% were between 80 and 89 years old, 32.4% were between 70 and 79 years old, 8.4% were between 60 and 69 years and 2.8% of the patient were between 50 and 59 years. 23 The most common laboratory anomalies observed have been lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, and high lactate dehydrogenase levels. These laboratory anomalies are similar to those previously seen in patients with MERS and SARS infections. In non-survivors, the neutrophil count, D dimer, blood urea, and creatinine levels continued to increase, and the lymphocyte count continued to decrease until the patients died. On the other hand, neutrophilia can be associated with the cytokine storm induced by the viral invasion, the activation of coagulation may have been associated with a sustained inflammatory response, and acute kidney injury may have been associated with the direct effects of the virus, hypoxia, and shock. The 3 pathological mechanisms may be associated with the death of patients with coronavirus induced pneumonia. 11 A recent meta-analysis shows that high procalcitonin levels is associated with a 5-time higher risk of severe infection due to SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 4.76; 95%CI: 2.74---8.29). 24 Although the total number of patients with COVID-19 with higher procalcitonin values seems limited, 25 the results of this meta-analysis suggests that serial measures of procalcitonin levels can play a role when it comes to predicting progression towards a more severe form of the disease. It is well-known that the production and release of procalcitonin into circulation is higher during bacterial infections. However, the synthesis of this biomarker is inhibited by interferon-gamma whose concentrations increase during viral infections. Therefore, it is not surprising to see that procalcitonin levels remain within the reference range in patients with uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 infections. It is not surprising to see either that a substantial increase of this levels is suggestive of bacterial co-infection in patients who develop severe forms of the disease, thus complicating the clinical condition. 26 On the other hand, the significant increase of C-reactive protein levels in blood has become an important marker of COVID-19. 27 As a matter of fact, significantly high C-reactive protein levels have been associated with a higher risk of developing SARS. 28 It has been recently reported how 4 patients with COVID-19 who met the criteria for hospital discharge or interruption of quarantine in China (no clinical symptoms and radiological anomalies and 2 negative results on the RT-PCR test later tested positive on the RT-PCR between 5 and 13 days later. These findings are suggestive that, at least, a percentage of recovered patients can still be carriers of the virus. Although no family member was infected, all of the patients described were health professionals who were especially serious about their home quarantine. Perhaps it will be necessary to reassess the current criteria for hospital discharge or quarantine interruption as well as the patients' continuous treatment. 29", "cite_spans": [{"start": 597, "end": 599, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1441, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1634, "end": 1636, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1737, "end": 1739, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2544, "end": 2546, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2673, "end": 2675, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2802, "end": 2804, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical signs and laboratory tests"}, {"text": "The images of pneumonias caused by virus are varied and unspecific, and they can be seen in other pulmonary infectious or inflammatory processes. 30, 31 The simple chest X ray shows an interstitial pattern in over 85% of the cases, and it occurs bilaterally in over 75% (Fig. 2) . On the other hand, greater damage in the simple X ray has been associated with the need for ICU admission. 32 The computed tomography (CT) images were used in the screening and selection of suspected cases in hospi-tals with high volumes of this entity. 26 Subsequent studies have showed the great utility of this imaging modality, even compared to molecular studies with findings suggestive of disease in patients with negative microbiological results. 33 The most common findings are images of ground-glass opacities associated or not with parenchymal condensation with air bronchogram; lung fissure thickening; peripheral distribution, and predominant damage of more than 1 lobe, usually bilateral. Less common are images of cavitation, pleural effusion, lung nodules or signs of lymphadenopathy. The presence of parenchymal consolidation and interlobular septal thickening has been associated with more severe cases that required ICU admission. These findings compel physicians to make differential diagnoses with other pneumonic processes of viral origin. Compared to other viruses of the same family, there seems to be a greater tendency to bilateral damage compared to SARS and no specific distribution pattern similar to MERS. 24,26,34---37 However, it is possible that no specific findings are found on the imaging modalities, so it is not a valid imaging modality to rule out patients with the disease, although normal CT images have been reported in a few cases even during the early stages of the disease. 12, 39 However, the CT scan has certain disadvantages since the availability of these machines can be insufficient, the patient needs to be transferred from the critical care unit, which can cause crossed infections. Viral pneumonia related injuries usually start in the terminal alveoli that are close to the pleura and can be seen clearly on a pulmonary ultrasound.

Its prevalence is between 17% and 53% depending on the series. Also, patients with severe viral infections who are eligible for ICU admission often show hypoxemic respiratory failure. Although the management of patients with SARS due to viral infection is similar to the management of SARS due to other etiologies, there are some differences that should be taken into account. 45 Regarding non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) the studies conducted to this day have focused on influenza virus related infections. In a multicenter study conducted among patients with influenza virus related respiratory failure, it was reported that 56.8% of the patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and that this fact was associated with a higher mortality rate at the ICU setting 46 (Fig. 3) . Regarding infections due to MERS a multicenter study published back in 2019 revealed that NIMV was started in 35 % of the patients. However, 92.4 % of them required IMV, and in this case no association with the ICU mortality rate was seen at the 90-day follow-up. 47 There are studies where the use of high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC) reduced the need for intubation. 48 However, patients who were ventilated with HFNCs should be monitored and assisted by experienced personnel capable of performing endotracheal intubations of the patient's clinical situation deteriorates rapidly or does not improve after a short period of time (approximately 1 h). 32 In this context, the utility of the ROX index could be assessed ([SatO 2 /FiO 2 ratio] \u00d7 RR) to predict early the need to increase respiratory support if it remains <3.85 after 12 h. 49 Currently, the recommendation established for the use of NIMV in patients with severe viral infections is to select patients properly since those with mild-to-moderate forms of hypoxemic respiratory failure can benefit themselves. 50 The protocol published by the Spanish Secretary of Health in collaboration with numerous Spanish medical societies (SEMICYUC included) recommends limiting the use of NIMV in very specific patients while taking into account the history of a high rate of failure in MERS induced infections. 51 Recently, an analysis of patients admitted to a Wuhan hospital with a diagnosis of severe respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19 revealed that 63.5% of the patients were treated with HFNCs, 56% of the patients received NIMV, and 42% required IMV.

Special care should be paid to airway procedures or those that expose the staff to respiratory secretions, as well as to the collection and transportation of respiratory specimens.

Similarly, when dealing with NIMV support, closed masks should be worn since they adapt very well to the patient's face and avoid accidental leaks. Double-limb respiratory circuits with antibacterial filters in both are recommended and should be seriously taken into consideration. 70 Intubation is perhaps the moment that involves the greatest risk of transmission. Therefore, it is a scenario that should be considered properly to just have the exact and necessary number of people in the room (the fewer number of people in contact with the patient the lower risk of transmission) and, of course, to have all the necessary material inside the room (to avoid having to enter or exit the room again). It is advisable that the most experienced health professional in the management of rapid sequence intubations should be the one who performs this technique to minimize the number of attempts so that it becomes an elective nonemergent intubation. Similarly, ambu-bag ventilation should be avoided to avoid generating aerosols.

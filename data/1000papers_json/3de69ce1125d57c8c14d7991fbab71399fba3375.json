As such, dengue vaccine development has been an active area of research. Previous studies selected attenuated vaccine candidates based on plaque size. However, these candidates led to mixed safety outcome in clinical trials, suggesting it is insufficiently informative as an indicator of dengue virus (DENV) attenuation. In this study, we examined the genome diversity of wild-type DENVs and their attenuated derivatives developed by Mahidol University and tested in phase 1 clinical trials. We found that the attenuated DENVs, in particular the strain under clinical development by Takeda Vaccines, DENV2 PDK53, showed significantly higher genome diversity than its wild-type parent, DENV2 16681. The determinant of genomic diversity was intrinsic to the PDK53 genome as infectious clone of PDK53 showed greater genomic diversity after a single in vitro passage compared to 16681 infectious clone. Similar trends were observed with attenuated DENV1 and DENV4, both of which were shown to be attenuated clinically, but not DENV3 that was not adequately attenuated clinically. Taken together, evidence presented here suggests that genome diversity could be developed into a marker of DENV attenuation.",

An estimated 100 million people around the world develop acute dengue annually, some of whom progress to lifethreatening severe dengue 1 . Dengue is caused by any one of four antigenically distinct dengue viruses (DENV1-4). As the geographic footprints of both DENVs and their principal mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti expand from the tropics to the subtropics, the number of people living in at risk regions is set to increase to over 6.1 billion people by 2080 2 . These trends underscore the urgency for an effective dengue vaccine to protect those living and traveling to at risk areas.",

Moreover, immunity from primary DENV infection places individuals at risk of severe dengue from an antibody-enhanced secondary infection with a heterologous DENV 4, 5 . Attempts to develop a full genome-based live attenuated DENVs have had mixed outcome. In particular, an international collaboration led by Mahidol University successfully produced the DENV2 PDK53 strain 6 , which has been shown to possess good safety and efficacy profiles in clinical trials 7 . However, the DENV3 derivative, PGMK30/FRhL3 produced using the same in vitro and in vivo criteria for attenuated strain selection, induced dengue-like illness among vaccinees 8 . This mixed outcome underlines the need for a more informative indicator of DENV attenuation to avoid unnecessary failures in clinical development.",

Likewise, the French neurotropic vaccine (FNV) strain of yellow fever, which was derived through serial mouse brain passage of the French viscerotropic virus (FVV), showed similarly reduced genome diversity compared to its wild-type parent 10 . However, while FNV was successfully used to reduce the burden of YFV in francophone Africa, it has since been discontinued as a vaccine due to high rates of post-vaccination encephalitis in children 12 .

The increased genome diversity observed in PDK53 compared to wild-type 16681 was also observed in infectious clones of these viruses, suggesting that increased genome diversity is an intrinsic phenotype of PDK53. We also found that in addition to PDK53, the clinically attenuated DENV1 PDK13 and DENV4 PDK48 strains also showed significantly more genome diversity than their parental wild-type strains. Remarkably, no significant difference in genome diversity was observed between the under-attenuated DENV3 PGMK-30/FRhL-3 and the wild-type DENV3 from which it was derived. Altogether, our data show that in contrast to YF17D, attenuated DENVs are more genetically diverse than wild-type strains 14 .",

PDK53 differs from 16681 by nine consensus mutations, of which 3 are nonsynonymous mutations ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). To distinguish variants from the average sequencing error rate, we used the program Lofreq, which identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms by incorporating base-call quality scores as error probabilities into its model and assigns a p-value to each variant 15, 16 . Lofreq was used to identify lower frequency allele variants that would otherwise be missed using conventional variant callers. Overall, our deep sequencing data showed positional variance that were evenly distributed throughout the genomes of both DENV2 strains (Fig. 1a) . We found a greater number of SNVs in PDK53 (n = 198) than 16681 (n = 130) (Fig. 1a) . However, the mean SNV allele frequency was less than one percent for both strains and was not significantly different between the two DENV2 strains (Fig. 1b) . The low mean allele frequency observed is consistent with the observation that the majority of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) occurred at a frequency of less than or equal to 1% (Fig. 1c) . These low frequency variants that make up a large portion of the SNVs population found, would have been dismissed as sequencing error using variant calling packages other than Lofreq.",

As a result, through multiple rounds of replication, these viral stocks would likely have acquired SNVs to form a heterogenous population. To determine if the observed differences in SNV diversity was due to passage history or factors intrinsic to the viral genomes, we repeated the above analysis using infectious clones of 16681 and PDK53. Infectious clones offered the opportunity to achieve a more homogenous starting point with the same passage history for the two genomes, thereby excluding virus passage history as a confounding factor. Infectious clones of DENV2 16681 and PDK53 were constructed based on previously reported full genome sequences of these strains using the Gibson assembly method as previously described 13 . Both viruses were then rescued in HEK293T cells (P0) and propagated once in Aedes albopictus-derived C6/36 cells (P1) and deep sequenced.",

To examine whether diversity after passage resulted from the acquisition of novel SNVs or selection of existing SNVs, we compared the diversity of the SNVs shared between P0 and P1 for 16681, as well as PDK53. If the SNVs found in both P0 were undergoing selection at P1, then the allele frequency of shared SNVs between P0 and P1 would be expected to increase, resulting in an increase in diversity at these sites. However, shared SNVs showed no significant difference in diversity for either 16681 (Fig. 2d) or PDK53 (Fig. 2e) , suggesting that that increased diversity after passage arose from the acquisition of novel SNVs, and not selection of existing SNVs.",

While this method identified attenuated DENV1, 2 and 4 strains in the form of PDK13, PDK53 and PDK48, respectively, DENV3 PGMK30/ FRhL3 retained a virulent phenotype 6 . Inadequately attenuated DENVs were also found in other attempts to derive dengue vaccine candidates 6, 19 . Furthermore, when YFV was attenuated through serial passaged in HeLa cells, the plaques got larger 20 . A more reliable method for ascertaining attenuation would be useful to avoid costly failures in clinical trials. Genome diversity has previously been shown to contribute to changes in viral fitness and pathogenesis 14 . Due to the error prone nature of their replication machinery, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme, RNA viruses exist as a collection of closely related genomes, or quasispecies. RdRp has an error rate of 1 in 10 4 , which translates approximately to one mutation per genome in virus with 10 kb genome 21 . Genomic diversity enables the viruses to adapt to novel ecological niches, including avoidance of population bottlenecks 22 . Indeed, previous works suggest that an optimal amount of genetic diversity is required for viral fitness and deviation from this may result in an attenuated phenotype 14 .",

Remarkably, the infectious clone of DENV2 PDK53 showed increased diversity after only a single passage compared to that of wild-type 16681, further supporting the notion that extent of genome diversity could be encoded in the genome. The increase in diversity between passage zero and one was due to several novel low frequency variants rather than at sites shared between the two passages. This finding suggests that new variants which emerge in the population could be more beneficial than selecting for preexisting SNVs. This is in line with recent studies which proposed that virus strains with high genome diversity could serve as candidates for live attenuated vaccines 25, 26, 28 .",

            "text": "While the mechanisms contributing to increased genome diversity in attenuated dengue remains unknown, it is possible that the increase in diversity of attenuated strains is a generalized result of dengue serial passage. Despite the low fidelity of its RdRp, the genome diversity of DENV remains limited in nature due to its continual transition between humans and mosquitoes -two hosts with very different immune environmental bottlenecks 15 . Here, we propose that increased genetic diversity in a novel niche could serve as a fitness advantage to select variant viruses that are best suited for a new environment (Fig. 4) . This is best exemplified by the increase in novel SNVs in DENV2 16681 and PDK53 infectious clones when they were transferred from their initial passage in HEK293T to C6/36 cells that served as a new environment at passage one. Furthermore, the attenuated DENV1, 2 and 4 strains from Mahidol University were derived from viruses passaged on primary dog kidney (PDK) cells and selected for their c Simpson's diversity of SNVs from 16681 and PDK53 infectious clones at P0 and P1. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine significance. Diversity of overlapping SNV sites between P0 and P1 in (d) 16681 and (e) PDK53. Statistical significance was determined using Mann-Whitney U test.

The mean diversity is shown above the respective data set. Statistical analysis between the two genomes was performed using Mann-Whitney U test. small plaque phenotype 6, 30 . It is possible that upon initial viral passage in the new PDK niche, the genetic diversity of the virus increased, providing a greater pool of variants in the absence of an immune barrier to create a bottleneck on genome diversity. These strains thus have the potential to serve as vaccine candidates as they have adapted to a novel ecological niche and were thus attenuated when placed back into its natural niche in humans and mosquitoes.",

DENV3 16562 could not be expanded in PDK cells and were thus passaged in primary green monkey kidney cells (PGMK) 30 times and fetal rhesus lung cells three times to derive the PGMK30/FRhL3 strain. Both of these cell types originated from non-human primates, which are more closely related to humans than dogs. These cells may not provide the novel environmental niche needed to generate genomic diversity for the discovery of a genetic variant that would be attenuated in humans and mosquitoes. This possibility is also supported by the lack of genetic diversity observed in Zika virus after passage in Vero (African green monkey kidney epithelial) cell-line 31 .",

However, the mechanism of attenuation of DENV is different to those that operate to attenuate YF17D which has less genome diversity compared to the wild-type strain 9,10,23 . The YF17D strain has a mutation in the non-structural 5 (NS5) protein which encodes the RdRp that leads to increased fidelity during virus replication 32 and consequently mitigates genome diversity 9 . Conversely, the Mahidol University DENV vaccine candidates do not harbor non-synonymous mutations in their RdRp, implying that increased diversity observed is likely independent of RdRp mutations. However, mutations outside of the RdRp have been known to affect replication fidelity 33 . Increased genome diversity has been linked to production of DVGs 29 . While DVGs have been observed in circulating dengue strains 34 , no DVGs were found in stock used in this study. However, as our sequencing was performed on virus from supernatant, it is possible that DVGs do result from increased diversity within the cell but are not packaged inside the exiting virion and thus are not picked up in our analysis.",

Briefly, C6/36 cells were infected with each virus (MOI = 0.1) and cell-free supernatant were harvested at 6 days post-infection. Infections were performed in triplicates for each virus. The input viruses, and supernatant from infected C6/36 cells were sent for next generation sequencing for variance analyses.

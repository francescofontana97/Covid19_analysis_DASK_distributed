We characterized the transcriptome of rhesus macaques and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Alarmin S100A8 was robustly induced by SARS-CoV-2 in animal models as well as in COVID-19 patients. Paquinimod, a specific inhibitor of S100A8/A9, could reduce inflammatory response and rescue the pneumonia with substantial reduction of viral titers in SASR-CoV-2 infected animals. Remarkably, Paquinimod treatment resulted in 100% survival of mice in a lethal model of mouse coronavirus (MHV) infection. A novel group of neutrophils that contributed to the uncontrolled inflammation and onset of COVID-19 were dramatically induced by coronavirus infections. Paquinimod treatment could reduce these neutrophils and regain antiviral responses, unveiling key roles of S100A8/A9 and noncanonical neutrophils in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.",

Most of the cells of the body harbor the protective machinery of the innate immunity and can recognize foreign invading viruses (Akira et al., 2006) . The innate immune system recognizes microorganisms via the pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and upon detection of invasion by pathogens, and PRRs activate downstream signaling pathways leading to the expression of various cytokines and immune-related genes for clearing the pathogens including bacteria, viruses and others (Akira et al., 2006) . With regards to SARS-CoV-2 infection, an overaggressive immune response has been noted which causes immunopathology Zhang et al., 2020) . In addition, T cell exhaustion or dysfunction has also been observed (Diao et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020a; Zheng et al., 2020b) . Besides, some studies suggest that there may be a unique immune response evoked by coronaviruses (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) . However, the nature of these responses elicited by the virus remains poorly understood.",

It is believed that neutrophils migrate from the circulating blood to infected tissues in response to inflammatory stimuli, where they protect the host by phagocytosing, killing and digesting bacterial and fungal pathogens (Nauseef and Borregaard, 2014; Nicolas-Avila et al., 2017) . The role of such a response in host defense against viral infection has not been clearly characterized. A recent study observed a new subpopulation of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients, which have been named developing neutrophils because they lack canonical neutrophil markers like CXCR2 and FCGR3B (Wilk et al., 2020) . However, it is still not clear how this type of neutrophil is activated. Moreover, the precise function of these cells is also unknown.",

However, uncontrolled production of alarmins is harmful or even fatal to the host in some cases. HMGB1 protein acts as a late mediator of lethal systemic inflammation in sepsis (Wang et al., 2004) . Therefore, anti-HMGB1 therapeutics have shown to be beneficial in experimental models of sepsis. S100A8 and S100A9 make up approximately 45% of the cytoplasmic proteins present in neutrophils. Both these proteins are members of the S100 group of proteins. S100A8 and S100A9 are also referred to as MRP8 and MRP14, respectively. Under physiological conditions, massive levels of S100A8 and S100A9 are stored in neutrophils and myeloid-derived dendritic cells, while low levels of S100A8 and S100A9 are expressed constitutively in monocytes (Foell et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2018) . S100A8 and S100A9 often form heterodimers (S100A8/A9) (Ometto et al., 2017) . The major functions of S100A8/A9 reported so far include the regulation of leukocyte migration and trafficking, the remodeling of cytoskeleton, amplification of inflammation and exertion of anti-microbial activity (Ometto et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018) . After being infected with bacteria, neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes intensely induce the expression and secretion of S100A8/A9 to modulate inflammatory processes through the induction of inflammatory cytokines.

A group of non-canonical neutrophils were also activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The abnormal immune responses were mediated by the S100A8/A9-TLR4 pathway. S100A8/A9 specific inhibitor, Paquinimod, significantly reduced the number of neutrophils activated by the coronavirus, inhibited viral replication and rescued lung damage a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The whole genome wide RNA-seq analysis of the lungs from infected rhesus macaques showed that a number of transcripts were induced or inhibited at day 3 and day 5 after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary Figure 1A) . The induction of primary antiviral factors, like type I IFNs was completely blocked during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary Figure 1B) . Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that a small group of genes involved in defense responses against viruses was induced ( Figure 1B) . However, interestingly, a greater number of genes involved in regulating cellular responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were induced by SARS-CoV-2 at day 3 post infection. An analysis of the KEGG pathways also showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced genes were enriched with more from anti-bacterial pathways than those from anti-viral pathways (Supplementary Figure 1C ). In line with this, neutrophil chemotaxis associated genes were also upregulated as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This upregulation was less significant at day 3, but more significant at day 5 when compared to the levels of genes related to antiviral responses that were induced as a result of the viral infection ( Figure 1B ). It is worthy to note that the number of neutrophils increases in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms (Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a) . Our results of the preliminary characterization of the early innate response to a SARS-CoV-2 challenge indicate that neutrophils are significantly activated at the very beginning of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The expression of alarmin protein S100A8 was robustly upregulated with 7,000-and 18,000-fold induction at day 3 and day 5 post SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively ( Figure 1E ). S100A8 acts as an alarmin through formation of heterodimers with S100A9, then these heterodimers function as danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules and activate innate immune responses via binding to pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). In our studies, S100A9 was also induced during the SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 1E ). The basal expression of S100A9 was much higher, but its induction was not as significant as that of S100A8. In fact, among all the known alarmins, S100A8 was the most significantly induced gene at both day 3 and day 5 post infection ( Figure   1F ). qRT-PCR analysis showed that the level of S100A8/9 surged along with an increase in the viral load in the lung of infected animals ( Figure 1G ). Next, we examined the expression of alarmins in the blood samples taken from infected rhesus macaques. S100A8/9 as well as the neutrophil marker genes were also induced by the viral infection ( Figure 1H ). Based on these results, we investigated if S100A8/A9 were upregulated in COVID-19 patients. Remarkably, both S100A8 and S100A9 were upregulated in post-mortem lung samples from COVID-19-positive patients when compared with biopsied healthy lung tissue from uninfected individuals ( Figure 1I ). The expression of neutrophil marker genes was also significantly increased in COVID-19-positive patients ( Figure 1I ). Concomitantly, the mRNA level of S100A8 was significantly higher in peripheral blood from COVID-19-positive patients when compared to healthy subjects (Supplementary Figure 1E) . A group of alarmins were induced in different types of blood cells of COVID-19-positive patients. For instance, S100A8 was significantly induced in red blood cells, CD14 + monocytes, CD16 + monocytes, neutrophils and developing neutrophils ( Figure 1J ). S100A8/A9 is the ligand of TLR4, which is the primary PRR that recognizes invading gram-negative bacterium and LPS. We thus observed a significant induction of genes that were predominantly involved in responses to LPS and anti-bacterial pathways. S100A8/A9 are also able to induce neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion, which probably contributed to the increased infiltration of neutrophils.",

We performed whole genome wide RNA-seq analysis to characterize the defense responses during viral infection ( Figure 2D) . Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 was only able to induce IFN\u03ba but not any other type I IFNs (Supplementary Figure 2D ). Both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV were able to induce IFN\u03b3 expression. IAV, but not SARS-CoV-2, induced type III IFNs production (Supplementary Figure 2D) . qRT-PCR further confirmed that IFN\u03b2 and ISG15 induction was impaired during SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 2C ). The induction of most ISGs was attenuated during SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with IAV infection (Supplementary Figure 2E) . However, SARS-CoV-2 but not IAV induced S100A8 and neutrophil marker genes Ly6g expression ( Figure 2C ). Consistently, other neutrophil marker genes were also induced by SARS -CoV-2 but not by IAV ( Figure 2D ). Similar to the data from rhesus macaque experiments, compared to other alarmins, S100A8 was robustly induced by SARS-CoV-2 but not by IAV infection in mice ( Figure 2E ). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection specifically induces the transcription of alarmin S100A8. To further confirm this, we infected C57BL/6 mice with other RNA-or DNA-viruses including encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and measured the expression of S100A8 in the lung of infected animals. None of these viruses were able to induce the expression of S100A8 ( Figure 2F ).",

We then infected IRF3/IRF7 double knockout mice and IFNAR deficient mice with MHV. Similar to the wild type mice, IRF3/IRF7 double knockout mice were able to eliminate the virus rapidly and did not develop severe pneumonia. Interestingly, IFNAR deficient mice showed obvious damage in pulmonary interstitium and alveoli ( Figure 2G ). All the mice died within 10 days ( Figure 2H ). We performed whole genome RNA-seq analysis to determine if MHV induced similar immune responses as those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lungs of MHV infected mice were collected at day 5 post infection and subjected to RNA analysis. Similarly, MHV induced genes were enriched in neutrophil chemotaxis and antibacterial pathways ( Figure 2I ). S100A8 was also significantly induced by MHV infection ( Figure 2J ). When compared to IAV, type I IFNs induction was impaired, but neutrophil marker genes were significantly induced by MHV infection ( Figure 2K and 2L).

Interestingly, a group of CD11b (high) Ly-6G (mid) cells showed up after MHV infection. Further analysis revealed that these cells were CD45 + granulocytes. A recent single cell analysis study had reported that a group of developing neutrophils was detected in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients with decreased expression of canonical neutrophil markers CXCR2 and FCGR3B (Wilk et al., 2020) . We purified these cells by using flow cytometry sorting. qRT-PCR analysis showed decreased expression of CXCR2 and FCGR3 ( Figure 2O ). To explore if other types of viruses or stimuli are able to induce these cells, we challenged C57BL/6 mice with IAV, EMCV, VSV, HSV-1 and LPS, hACE2 transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2 through nasal inoculation.

To test this, we treated the SARS-COV-2 infected mice with S100A8/A9 inhibitor Paquinimod ( Figure 3A ). Expectedly, Paquinimod was able to rescue the weight loss of infected mice and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 viral replication significantly ( Figure 3B and 3C). Consistently, the expressions of neutrophil markers (Ly6G, MMP8, LTF), IL-6 and S100A8 were significantly reduced after Paquinimod treatment ( Figure 3D ). More strikingly, Paquinimod completely rescued the death of MHV infected, but not IAV infected IFNAR deficient mice and significantly inhibited MHV replication ( Figure 3E , 3F and Supplementary Figure 3A ). The expression of neutrophil marker genes in lung and blood from infected mice was also inhibited by Paquinimod ( Figure 3G , 3H and Supplementary Figure 3B ). The damages to pulmonary interstitium and alveoli were alleviated, and infiltration of S100A8 + cells was also reduced by Paquinimod ( Figure 3I and 3J).",

To determine if Paquinimod could reduce the number of these abnormal cells, we performed flowcytometry to analyze the cell population during coronavirus infection. Coronavirus-specific neutrophils were significantly reduced in blood and lung after treatment with Paquinimod ( Figure 4A ). It is believed that S100A8/A9 can activate TLR4 or receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) pathways. Interestingly, TLR4 inhibitor (Resatorvid) but not RAGE inhibitor (Azeliragon) was able to reduce the number of these neutrophils suggesting that S100A8/A9 activated these neutrophils via TLR4 pathway ( Figure 4A ). Moreover, MHV infection also induced these neutrophils in liver and bone marrow, which could be suppressed by TLR4 inhibitor ( Figure 4B ). Consistently, Resatorvid was able to inhibit viral replication in lung and blood of the infected mice ( Figure 4C ). Moreover, both Paquinimod and Resatorvid suppressed the activation of coronavirus related neutrophils in lung during SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 4D ). To confirm the role of TLR4 in activating S100A8 related signaling, we examined S100A8 induction upon LPS treatment. LPS induced S100A8 expression through adaptor protein MyD88 (Supplementary Figure 4A) . We then treated mouse macrophages with the serum from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice with or without Paquinimod treatment. The serum from infected mice was able to induce the expression of S100A8 and CXCL2 but not IL-1\u03b2 or IL-6 in a MyD88 dependent manner ( Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure 4B ). S100A8 further activated TLR4 signaling to form a positive loop. We thus observed that Paquinimod was able to inhibit the induction of S100A8 ( Figure 3D and 3G-H).",

Compared to noninfected mice, MHV induced expression of all 3 G1 maker genes and 1 maker gene from G0 to G1, but inhibited expression of other maker genes ( Figure 4F ). Interestingly, Resatorvid was able to reverse the expression of marker genes back to the normal levels. The expression of canonical neutrophil markers CXCR2, LY6G and FCGR3 were decreased after MHV infection ( Figure 4G ). We further analyzed the RNA-seq data of lung samples taken from the mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 and IAV. G5B population, the matured neutrophil, was activated during IAV infection ( Figure 4H and Supplementary Figure 4C ). Whereas SARS-CoV-2, similar to the results from bone marrow experiments ( Figure 4F ), activated G1 subpopulation significantly. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 also induced other premature neutrophil markers from G2 to G4 subpopulation in lung ( Figure 4H and Supplementary Figure 4C ). Interestingly, Paquinimod was able to turn off the abnormal upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Figure 4D) .

Over or sustained expression of alarmins could result in uncontrolled inflammation (Chan et al., 2012; Cher et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2014; Patel, 2018) . Such imbalanced immune responses and cytokine storm contribute to the development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 and MHV, but not any other tested viruses, induced a robust and sustained transcription of the alarmin S100A8 in animal models (Figure 1 D-G and Figure 2 ). In line with this, the substantial upregulation of S100A8 was also observed in the lung and peripheral blood of infected macaques and COVID-19 patients ( Figure 1H and 1I) . Although we did observe that the SARS-CoV-2 and the other types of viruses could induce S100A8 expression slightly in blood at day 1 post infection ( Figure 2C) , however, the induction of S100A8 by viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 was either unchanged or reduced at day 5 post infection. S100A8 expression increased dramatically by 300 folds at day 5 post infection ( Figure 2C ).",

Thus, IFNAR deficient mice and MHV through its ability to evoke similar immune responses as SARS-CoV-2, could serve as useful models for investigating ARDS associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although we inoculated wild type, MAVS knockout, STING knockout, ELF4 knockout and IRF3/IRF7 double knockout mice with MHV intranasally, none of these mice developed obvious ARDS related symptoms. IRF3 and IRF7 are key transcription factor of type I IFNs. Type I IFNs activate interferon stimulated genes by binding IFNAR. Since the IRF3/IRF7 double knockout phenotype was not susceptible to MHV infection, it seems like IFNAR can exert its function in a type I IFNs independent way. Previous studies (Hadjadj et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) and our above data showed that induction of type I IFNs is completely blocked during SARS-CoV-2 and MHV infections. This further suggests that IFNAR is involved in defense against coronavirus with an unknown mechanism.",

Moreover, a recent study identified that a group of premature neutrophils in COVID-19 patients that do not express canonical neutrophil markers like CXCR2 and FCGR3B. Bacterial coinfection is common in viral pneumonia, especially, in critically ill patients (Bost et al., 2020) . Neutrophils can be activated during bacterial infection and are critical for killing invading bacteria (Deng et al., 2013; Li et al., 2002) . The increased neutrophil number and developing neutrophils in patients could be attributed to coinfection of bacterium. However, results of our studies showed that the premature neutrophils were induced by coronavirus at the early stage of infection in animal models. We compared these cells with 8 neutrophil subpopulations that were proposed in a recent study. Coronavirus induced neutrophils in bone marrow and lung belong to the G1 population predominately ( Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure 4B) .

After clustering, the libraries were sequenced on Illumina Hiseq X Ten platform using (2\u00d7150bp) paired-end module. The raw images were transformed into raw reads by base calling using CASAVA (http://www. illumina.com/ support/ documentation.ilmn). Then, raw reads in a fastq format were first processed using in-house perl scripts. Clean reads were obtained by removing reads with adapters, reads in which unknown bases were more than 5% and low quality reads (the percentage of low quality bases was over 50% in a read, we defined the low quality base to be the base whose sequencing quality was no more than 10).

Consistent with the results from the rhesus macaque experiments, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not trigger typical antiviral immune responses (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 2A). GO analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced genes were enriched in antibacterial humoral response and neutrophil chemotaxis at day 1, day 3 and day 5 post infection. In contrast to this, IAV induced genes were enriched in defense response to virus and cellular response to IFN\u03b2 (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 2B). KEGG analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced genes were enriched in bacterium related and autoimmune pathways at day 1, day 3 and day 5 post infection. Comparatively, IAV induced genes were enriched within virus related pathways (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 2B). We further analyzed the differentially induced genes at different time intervals after SARS-CoV-2 infection. GO analysis showed that while SARS-CoV-2 induced antibacterial responses, neutrophil related and other processes, IAV induced canonical antiviral responses and activated type I IFNs signaling (Figure 2C and supplementary Figure 2C). We then evaluated the expression of IFNs in the lungs during SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infection. Except for IFN\u03ba, all the type I IFNs were significantly induced by IAV infection (Supplementary",

This methodological systematic review describes the outcomes evaluated in 415 RCTs on the management of COVID-19, that were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, by 5 May 2020, and the instruments used to measure these outcomes. Significant heterogeneity was observed in the selection of outcomes and instruments. Mortality, adverse events and treatment success or failure are only evaluated in 64.4%, 48.4% and 43% of the included studies, respectively, while other outcomes are selected less often. Studies focusing on more severe presentations (hospitalized patients or requiring intensive care) most frequently evaluate mortality (72.5%) and adverse events (55.6%), while hospital admission (50.8%) and viral detection/load (55.6%) are most frequently assessed in the community setting. Outcome measurement instruments are poorly reported and heterogeneous. Follow-up does not exceed one month in 64.3% of these earlier trials, and long-term COVID-19 burden is rarely assessed. The methodological issues identified could delay the introduction of potentially life-saving treatments in clinical practice. Our findings demonstrate the need for greater consistency, to enable decision makers to compare and contrast studies.",

Characteristically, within ten months, over 60 thousand publications focusing on COVID-19 were indexed in PubMed and almost two thousand interventional studies were registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov database. However, the limited knowledge about the disease and the need for an expeditious response to the unfolding pandemic did not allow, in some cases, for adequate methodological planning and co-ordination. Extensive research duplication (or better multiplication) has been observed, with numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the same interventions for COVID-19 in parallel [3] . Moreover, standardization is lacking in trial design and could limit comparability. An important source of variability in trial design could arise from the outcomes (endpoints) that are selected for evaluation. Heterogeneity in trial outcomes and omission of outcomes that are critically important to patients and clinicians complicate interpreting, comparing and synthesizing trial results, potentially delaying the introduction of novel, life-saving treatments into clinical practice [4, 5] .",

Complete resolution of the symptoms and signs of COVID-19 (clinical recovery) is used as a measure of treatment success in 51/220 (23.2%) outcomes and clinical improvement in 38/220 (17.3%) outcomes. The definition of complete resolution varies. Often, no further information is provided. In the remaining cases, it is defined as a composite outcome including several of the following components: complete resolution of breathlessness, tachypnoea, hypoxia, desaturation, cough, anosmia, myalgia, fever, or of oxygen requirements; a negative COVID-19 PCR; hospital discharge; or radiological resolution. A definition of clinical improvement as an outcome is also frequently lacking. In the remaining cases, it is defined as an improvement in several of the previously listed components. Improvement is either based on prespecified thresholds, or on a subjective clinicians' judgement. Finally, 14 outcomes (6.4%), use specific thresholds (0, \u22642 or \u22644) of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS or NEWS-2) to define treatment success. Treatment failure, or time to treatment failure is evaluated by 76 outcomes. In most cases (40/76, 52.6%), treatment failure is defined as a composite outcome consisting of several components with clear thresholds, such as: death, need for ICU admission, need for invasive ventilation, need for other organ support (e.g., vasopressors or renal replacement therapy), need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV), need for supplemental oxygen, a deterioration in oxygenation, need for hospital admission or re-admission or emergency visit, ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Ordinal clinical severity scales such as the WHO scale are used to define treatment failure in 16/76 (21.1%) outcomes, while the need for rescue therapy is used in 9/76 (11.8%) outcomes.

Ordinal clinical severity scales were consistently used across the included studies to assess treatment success or failure and disease severity. Given the acute nature of COVID-19, and significant changes in the clinical status of patients in the course of the disease, such scales can effectively capture disease progression, especially in more severe presentations. Most of these scales follow the structure of the WHO scale, removing scale points for simplicity. Despite sharing a similar structure, these scales group patients differently, limiting interpretability and comparability. The WHO recently introduced a revised 11-point Scale, with increased granularity, and it would be advisable for all studies to align relevant outcomes with this revised scale, to improve interpretability and comparability [12] . To evaluate treatment success or failure, most studies used a 2-point change in the ordinal scale as a threshold, that corresponds to a significant change in the clinical status of the patient and this seems appropriate.",

Only seven trials stated an intent to explore the development of pulmonary fibrosis. However, persistent symptoms, such as fatigue or breathlessness, and quality of life deficits are detected in many hospitalized patients, two to three months after discharge [21] [22] [23] . Moreover, fibrotic changes are detected in about one in three survivors of a hospitalization for COVID-19 infection [24, 25] .

Several methods were described to account for this bias. Some studies stated the duration of hospital or ICU stay will be censored for deceased participants, while others assessed the days that participants are alive and out of hospital or ICU, instead. Homogenization and detailed description of the analytical approaches in the study protocols, along with the outcomes and outcome measurement instruments are crucial for increasing transparency and comparability.

The WHO Working Group on the Clinical Characterisation and Management of COVID-19 infection recommends the minimal use of three outcomes: mortality, viral burden and non-mortal clinical outcomes evaluated using the WHO clinical progression scale [12] . WHO also highlighted the need for a longer follow-up, of at least 60 days, to capture disease mortality, which is not adopted by most identified trials. Two other groups prioritized specific outcomes and measurement instruments, all of which were captured in our analysis, but were not necessarily the most frequently used [10, 11] . The last core outcome set prioritized broader domains to be addressed, rather than specific outcomes [9] . These domains encompass most outcomes identified in this methodological review. The same group also highlighted the need to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on patient status and life impact in the longer term. Looking across these core outcome sets, a meta-core outcome set (meta-COS) was identified, only including the two domains that were prioritized by all initiatives (mortality and respiratory support), as the most critical, to be evaluated in all future RCTs in hospitalized patients [26] . Both domains recommended by the meta-COS were evaluated in 205 (49.4%) of the included studies.",

Importantly, the study protocols of some of the included RCTs have been amended since then and our methodological systematic review is a snapshot of the RCT designs and plans as of May-August 2020. Moreover, we only evaluated studies registered with the U.S. National Library of Medicine clinical trials register (ClinicalTrials.gov). However, our extensive, globally representative sample of 415 ongoing RCTs was a major strength of our methodological survey and we strongly believe it was sufficient to capture all relevant outcomes and measurement instruments. Characteristically, after extracting data from approximately 25% and 70% of the included trials, we reached saturation with regards to the outcome categories and the outcome measurement instruments, respectively. Therefore, we are confident that we have not missed important outcomes by focusing exclusively on clinicaltrials.gov. Future studies will need to assess the impact of the emerging evidence on the natural history and outcomes of COVID-19 and of the four published core outcome sets and the meta-COS on the selection of outcomes in more recently registered trials. Another limitation of our study is the lack of a prospectively registered protocol. However, we have used rigorous methodology recommended by the COMET Initiative, that we have previously employed in similar methodological systematic reviews [13] .",

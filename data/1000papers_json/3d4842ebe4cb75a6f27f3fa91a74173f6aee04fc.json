The estimate of a limited reopening \"budget\" allows for consideration of policy alternatives in light of the reader's own estimates regarding the timing of these developments. By contrast, existing cost effectiveness analyses of COVID-19 interventions use fixed end dates. (3, 4) Such analyses implicitly assume that a vaccine will be available by the given end date. If a vaccine is not available on the ad hoc end date, however, then the public health restrictions under study have simply delayed COVID-19 mortality rather than prevented it, radically changing the costeffectiveness evaluation.",

This number is derived by extending the Penn Wharton epidemiological model (5) \"Full Reopening\" policy scenario and \"Reduced Social Distancing\" behavior scenario under an exponential model until herd immunity is achieved (when the total number of people who have been infected and recovered) exceeds 65% of the population). In this model, herd immunity is achieved on January 23, 2021.

We utilize the mortality projections from this model through July 2020 and assume that under the partial reopening occurring as of end of May 2020, the U.S. would limit additional COVID-19 deaths to 26,285 per month (315,420 per year), which is equal to the average monthly deaths in the Penn baseline model from May 26, 2020 through July 30, 2020. In our extension of the Penn Wharton model, mortality does not flatten further but merely continues at this roughly linear pace as the search for a vaccine or therapeutic continues. Maintaining a limited reopening policy that is restricted to the May 26, 2020 level over the next 12 months therefore saves approximately 1.35 million lives relative to a relatively unrestrained pandemic ending in herd immunity, or on the order of approximately 9.1 million quality adjusted life-years saved relative to full reopening.

Lesser restrictions (\"full reopening\" policy and \"reduced social distancing\" behavior scenarios) in the Penn Wharton model are associated with an increase in GDP of 1.4% year on year, an absolute decrease of 0.8% from the Congressional Budget Office's pre-COVID projections of 2.2% growth.(18) Of note, the Penn Wharton model attributes less economic importance to individual behavioral changes that are independent of official pronouncements than prior modeling of the economic effects of pandemics.(18-20) All GDP calculations are discounted at 3% annually in our calculations in parallel with QALY discounting.

In this study, we measured physical activity before and after the state of emergency, and assessed the factors that affected physical activity. [Participants and Methods] We included thirteen elderly people living in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan, in the study. The participants wore 3-axis accelerometer on their hips to measure physical activity for a week, before (in October 2019) and after the state of emergency. According to the median rate of decrease in physical activity (23.6%), we divided the participants into two groups: one group had participants with a high rate of decrease (low physical activity) and the other had participants with a low rate of decrease (high physical activity).",

            "text": "On January 16, 2020, a man who traveled abroad was reported as the first infected person in Japan 5) . Since then, the number of infected people gradually increased. On April 16, a state of emergency was issued to all prefectures in Japan. Following the issuance of this declaration, the prefectural governor requested the residents to refrain from going out unnecessarily, and after setting the period and area, requested business owners to limit the opening of stores and facilities (self-restraint of activities). Residents refrained from going out except when necessary to maintain their livelihoods such as going to a medical institution, buying groceries, or commuting to work. Leisure facilities and events were also closed or postponed due to this request 6) . Several reasons for going out are physical activity (PA), housework, shopping, etc. in a period of quarantine. Elderly people in particular are at risk of COVID-19 infection, but they need to avoid a sedentary lifestyle to prevent heart failure. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that older people do the following to maintain their health: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity PA, 75 minutes of high-intensity PA, or a combination per week 7) . In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare recommends that PA be performed at 10 metabolic equivalents (METs) / hour / week, regardless of the PA Standards 2013 for Health Promotion and Physical Activity Guidelines for Health Promotion. Specifically, exercise for 40 minutes or longer 8, 9) . Sedentary lifestyles and lowPA have been reported to increase the risk of heart failure and cerebrovascular disease in people with comorbidities such as hypertension and dyslipidemia 10) . There is a relationship between short-term (1-4 weeks) inactivity and increased cardiovascular risk factors, in addition to detrimental effects on cardiovascular function and structure 11) . Furthermore, low intensity PA improves athletic performance, quality of life, and the prognosis of both patients with heart failure and healthy adults [12] [13] [14] . There are several methods for measuring these physical activities such as self-reported questionnaires, heart rate monitoring, and pedometers [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Among them, wearable 3-axis accelerometers can measure body movements even at low intensity and use METs to indicate intensity 20, 21) . However, no study has used a three-dimensional accelerometer to measure the decrease in daily PA (volume) of the elderly during a period of self-restraint upon announcement of a state of emergency. In addition, it is unclear what factors are not affected by self-restraint. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to elucidate how much self-restraint from activity by the elderly with diseases, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, reduces PA, and what factors are unaffected by self-restraint.",

In 2013, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare recommended that the amount of PA for people aged 65 and over be 10 METs*h/w of PA for 40 minutes every day, regardless of intensity, in the PA standards for health promotion 10) . In addition, the AHA recommend twice the amount of PA (1,000 METs*min/w) as Hegde et al., which reduces the risk of readmission for patients with heart failure preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) by 19% 24, 25) . In this study, the total amount of PA was lower after the announcement. When the activity units in this study were converted to the same units used by the AHA, the activity amount was 1,127.8 \u00b1 134.9 METs*min/w before the announcement and 876.0 \u00b1 180.5 METs*min/w after the announcement. The amount of PA during self-restraint exceeded the Hegde recommendation, but not that recommended by the AHA [25] [26] [27] . The amounts of light-intensity and moderate-intensity activity decreased after self-restraint. As the average walking intensity and the average intensity of daily activity did not change after refraining from activity, the amount of activity decreased due to the shortening of the activity time. The number of steps also decreased after self-restraint. Regarding this decrease in the number of steps after self-restraint, there was no difference in the amount of moderate-intensity walking activity (p=0.23), but there was a difference in the amount of light-intensity walking activity (p=0.03). Clarke et al. reported that the PA decreased by approximately 6% annually per year in elderly Scottish individuals 28) . Yamada et al. reported that the total physical activity time in the elderly decreased significantly in April 2020 compared to January 2020 29) . The amount of PA of all participants in this study decreased by 22.3% after self-restraint (6 months). The comparison before and after self-restraint between the High-PA group and the Low-PA group is discussed below. The decrease in activity in the High-PA group was 20.4% for moderate-intensity activity, 8.5% for light-intensity activity, and 12.0% for total activity. In contrast, the decrease in medium intensity activity was 45.5%, that in light-intensity activity was 29.2%, and that in total activity was 33.9% in the Low-PA group. Both groups exceeded the 6% reported by Clarke et al 28) . Boyle et al. reported an increase in markers of vascular apoptosis and activation within 3-5 days of inactivity after 1 week of reduced daily PA (50%, from 10,000 to 5,000 steps/week) 30) . In this study, the number of steps decreased by 38.9% after self-restraint (6 months) (from 5,742 to 3,506). In addition to the extension of the self-restraint period and the decrease in activity due to aging, the amount of activity became lower than that recommended by the AHA, which may lead to cardiovascular events. In order to further elucidate the effects of PA on the clinical outcome of the elderly by refraining from activity due to the influence of COVID-19, a large-scale study targeting more participants is needed in the future.",

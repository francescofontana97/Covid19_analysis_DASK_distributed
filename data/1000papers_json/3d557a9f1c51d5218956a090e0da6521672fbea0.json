Antibiotics are some of the most frequently prescribed medications in nursing homes, with point prevalence studies indicating that on any given day, approximately 10% of nursing home residents receive antibiotics [2] [3] [4] [5] . Unfortunately, 25-75% of antibiotic use in nursing homes is inappropriate [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Reasons to deem an antibiotic as inappropriate include an unnecessary indication (i.e., a viral infection), excessive length of therapy, selecting the wrong dose, or choosing an agent that is unnecessarily broad or does not treat the suspected bacterial pathogen. Systemic antibiotics may lead to adverse events including side effects, allergic reactions, drug-drug interactions, Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), and selection for multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs).",

            "text": "Antibiotic stewardship seeks to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, which in turn supports patient safety and quality healthcare. Driven by the increasing prevalence of both CDI and MDROs across all healthcare settings [11, 12] , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) required all nursing homes to have an antibiotic stewardship program by November 2017 [13] . In support of these efforts, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a framework for antibiotic stewardship implementation called the Core Elements that detail actions critical for the success of antibiotic stewardship implementation [14] . Two of the seven Core Elements important to successful antibiotic stewardship programs are tracking and reporting antibiotic use. Many nursing homes lack resources, expertise, and infrastructure to assess antibiotic use in their buildings. Previous work has addressed the utility of using data from pharmacy invoices to measure antibiotic use in nursing homes [15] . Expanding on those efforts, we recently used pharmacy invoice data to characterize antibiotic use in 29 nursing homes in the United States [16] . Here, we describe in detail the process of transforming pharmacy invoices into a robust dataset that permits assessment of the following important antibiotic use metrics: overall days of therapy; length of therapy; antibiotic starts; use of intravenous agents; spectrum of antibiotic use based on specific antibiotic classes. We also developed a web interface that supports further analysis as well as tracking and reporting antibiotic use.",

The healthcare corporation sent comma separated values (CSV) Fig. 1 Conceptual overview of process used to transform pharmacy invoices into a database suitable for analysis. A single dispensing pharmacy provided several years of invoice data for nursing homes in the same healthcare corporation. We began with aggregating the data, which varied in the number and names of columns. This process revealed large gaps or irregularities in the data, such as a nursing home that entered or left the corporation during the study period; these nursing homes were removed. This yielded a single aggregated database with a consistent format. Data cleaning was a multi-step process leading to a dataset consisting of a single row to describe each prescription (including refills) for systemic medications administered on a regular schedule. This was the dataset used to analyze antibiotic use across a large number of nursing homes. Please see the text for further details files containing invoices from January 2014 to June 2018. Each file included monthly invoices from several nursing homes, with each row in the file representing a transaction related to a prescription for an individual resident. We aggregated these files, which varied in the number of columns, into a single database with uniform column names and standardized data formats within each column. These data were then assessed for their distribution over time, by monthly intervals, as well as by individual nursing homes. Gaps or notable changes in the number of invoices from individual nursing homes were discussed with leadership at the healthcare corporation who provided context for some of these changes, such as a temporary closure or change in the resident population.",

The rational for using antihypertensives is that these agents are commonly prescribed, including among nursing home residents, and have not been subject to recent changes in guidance or recommendations that might lead to changes in their use. In combination with census data, we quantified systemic medications by the number of starts per 1000 bed days of care (BDOC), days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 BDOC, and length of therapy (in days). Both the number of starts/1000 BDOC and DOT/1000 BDOC are common metrics to assess antibiotic use [19, 20] . The number of starts/1000 BDOC assesses the frequency of prescribing. DOT/1000 BDOC is the number of calendar days a medication is administered standardized to total days in care and describes the overall rate of use; we determined this based on the days supply [21, 22] . For some medications, particularly those with several refills or with a transaction date near the end of a month, the total DOT exceeded the calendar days in that month. Accordingly, for calculating DOT/1000 BDOC at monthly intervals, we distributed the DOT across months. For example, if an anti-hypertensive was prescribed for 90 days starting We also used previously described antibiotic spectrum index (ASI) to summarize prescribed antibiotics on a quantitative scale from 1 to 13, with lower values indicating more narrow-spectrum agents and higher values more broad-spectrum agents (Additional file 1: Table S2 ) [23] . We calculated the monthly mean ASI among the antibiotic DOT for each facility.",

We further merged data elements used to describe operational characteristics, resident demographics, and quality indicators specific to nursing homes [17, 18] . In summary, our results indicated the following: between 2014 and 2016, the overall rate of antibiotic use did not change; fluoroquinolones were the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics; and the mean ASI was similar across nursing homes [16] .

Antibiotic DOT/1000 BDOC based on dispensing data was consistently greater than that those based on invoice data (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). This is consistent with the resident populations encompassed by these datasets: dispensing data accounts for all residents in the nursing home while invoice data accounts primarily for residents receiving skilled nursing care. Comparing the monthly 2016 measures from both data sources, the Spearman rho correlation for antibiotic DOT/1000 BDOC was high (> 0.7) for two nursing homes and moderate (0.5-0.7) for three nursing homes. When we focused on intravenous antibiotics, typically administered only to residents receiving skilled nursing care and thus expected to occur in invoice data with a CMS payor, the Spearman rho correlation values increased for five of the six nursing homes. For one of the nursing homes, the correlation decreased from 0.81 to 0.39. Leadership from the healthcare corporation confirmed that the operational characteristics for this nursing home were similar to the others and suggested the possibility of errors related to transfer of data specific to compounded intravenous medications, which are often handled through a different software system. Figure 2 shows the interface, which included an array information organized into five tabs. The first tab, Number of Records, provided an overview of the number of records removed with each cleaning step. The second tab, Fig. 2 The website offers a comprehensive and detailed interface. Users may easily parse data for specific nursing homes by year and/or month and compare results among individual or groups of nursing homes. The website also allows users to assess antibiotic use relative to an array of nursing home characteristics. Finally, the website permits users to generate an antibiotic use report that compares their nursing homes against others, with data elements normalized to bed days of care when appropriate. The graph shows the antibiotic spectrum index (ASI) for all nursing homes studied from 2014 to 2016, stratified by antibiotic days of therapy per 1000 bed days of care Drug Rates, had five sub-tabs that gave access to several antibiotic use metrics including overall rates of antibiotic use, length of antibiotic therapy, antibiotic use categorized by class of agent, and the antibiotic spectrum index (shown in the graph in Fig. 2 ), which provides a quantitative comparison of the activity of antibiotics against bacterial pathogens. An additional sub-tab compared antibiotic use to all systemic medications and to use of anti-hypertensive agents. With the third tab, Compare, users could parse nursing homes into two subgroups and use robust data visualization to compare several antibiotic use metrics. The fourth tab, LTCFocus, provided data and graphs that describe relationships between antibiotic use and nursing home characteristics, as assessed by CMS and made available through LTCFocus.org [17] . Finally, the Report tab generated two simple graphs that provide comparative feedback so that both clinical and administrative staff can understand how antibiotic use at their facility compares to antibiotic use at nursing homes with a similar number of beds (Fig. 3) . Filters available within the website permitted users to examine individual or groups of nursing homes and to specify the time frame assessed. Another feature, labeled Data Table and at the bottom on most of the tabs, permitted users to download data for further analysis. Across all the tabs, tooltips are also available when the user hovers over, focuses on, or touches an element of figures.

These coupled results support the use of cleaned invoice data as a valid measure of antibiotic use. 4/28/2021 4:23:00 PMFurthermore, we developed a website specifically designed to serve as an interface that ready visualization of several antibiotic use metrics. The approach described and the resulting website support comparing antibiotic use among nursing homes within a network or region served by the same dispensing pharmacy. The strengths of the website are the displays that permit visualization of changes over time as well as comparisons to other sites. The user-friendly design encourages changing views to answer questions specific to an individual site. Furthermore, while tracking and reporting antibiotic use typically falls under the purview of a nursing home's infection preventionist(s), the members of the antibiotic stewardship team or the Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (QAPI) committee could also use the website. They may be interested in assessing changes following an intervention, such as restricting use of fluoroquinolones, the most commonly prescribed antibiotic class, to residents with severe penicillin allergies. Examination of antibiotic use over time makes it possible to detect unintended consequences of changes. Building on the previous example, restricting use of fluroquinolones may lead to an increase in other antibiotics, such as clindamycin or doxycycline. Inclusion of identifying information may enable assessment of additional antibiotic stewardship metrics, such as conversion from intravenous to oral antibiotic administration.",

Guidelines for hospitalbased antibiotic stewardship programs call for a core multidisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship team that includes an infectious diseases-trained physician and clinical pharmacist as well as a clinical microbiologist, hospital epidemiologist, information specialist, and an infection preventionist [27] . Except for an infection preventionist, individual nursing homes do not typically employ individuals with these skill sets. Indeed, CMS indicates that in nursing homes, the antibiotic stewardship program is part of the broader infection prevention and control program, which is led by one or more infection preventionists [13] . CMS estimates that for the average nursing home, only 15% of a fulltime equivalent (FTE) is required for the entirety of the infection prevention and control program [13] . The disproportionate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on nursing home residents, which account for only 4% of cases and over 33% of deaths in the US [28] , is a strong indicator more resources are needed to support infection prevention and control in nursing homes, which in turn will enhance resident safety. We suggest that 15% of an FTE may be an adequate allocation specifically for tracking and reporting antibiotic use in nursing homes.

Previous work at a Veterans Affairs hospital compared medical orders with BCMA data to assess antibiotic metrics. While both approaches had errors, BCMA data was more accurate, consistent with this being a process that confirms that the correct medication at the correct dose is being given to the correct patient at the point of care [29] . As assessment of BCMA data from 13 nursing homes, however, found an error rate of 90%, with most errors related to the timing of medications that require administration (i.e., every 4 to 6 h) [30] . While these findings belie the expectation of strong medication adherence in all institutionalized settings, using electronic medical record to assess antibiotic use in nursing homes would likely be superior to pharmacy invoice data [31] . Not all nursing homes have adopted electronic medical records and those that have may not have personnel with time and expertise to extract antibiotic use data for tracking and reporting purposes.",

Kabbani et al. also used invoice data to assess antibiotic use. In contrast to the dataset discussed here, their invoices did not have the prescription numbers that permitted us to link dispensing events related to a single medication. Even with this limitation, Kabbani et al. [15] were able to compare the antibiotic days of therapy among 12 nursing homes, finding a five-fold difference in rates between the lowest-and highest-use homes. The use of dispensing data would likely permit more accurate assessment of discontinued medications, which would help to improve the accuracy for antibiotic use metrics in intravenous agents in particular, as these may requiring multiple dispensing events for a single course. Dispensing data, however, may not be as readily accessed as invoice data.",

Independent nursing homes may still use the process outlined, along with the website, to assess antibiotic use over time. Second, the steps used to clean the data may not apply to data format used by some pharmacy invoice systems. We assert that the general approach outlined will serve as a template for information technologists to work directly with their own data. They may be able to use additional data fields, such as the indications for antibiotics prescribed, to yield further information relevant to antibiotic stewardship efforts. Third, like any system, errors may accrue. Minor discrepancies inherent to using pharmacy invoices include unbilled single-dose medication administration, cancelled orders, changes in treatment, or resident transfers. As long as these events remain at a reasonably low and fairly consistent level, they should not interfere with the overall meaning of antibiotic use data. More notable problems with the data are likely be noticed by end-users who will need to work with information technologists to identify potential sources of error and validate the data.",

Ultimately, our hope is that this approach will reduce some of the barriers to tracking and reporting antibiotic use and will become another tool used by nursing homes to improve the use of antibiotics and thus, enhance the safety and quality of care for their residents.",

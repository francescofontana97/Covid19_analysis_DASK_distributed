Nearly three-fourths (72.9%) of our participants felt that getting through quarantine would have been more difficult if they did not have any electronic gadgets. Of these, a majority (85.8%) had a general feeling of tiredness and lacked motivation (p = 0.023). Additionally, a large number of students (69.7%) had reported that time is seemingly moving faster. A significant relationship between increased usage of electronic items and longer sleep periods was also noted (p = 0.005). With respect to the level of education statistically significant values were noted for alarm use both before and after quarantine began (p = 0.021 and p = 0.004, respectively).

Our findings show that the increase in use of social media applications led to a widespread increase in the length of sleep, worsening of sleep habits (people sleeping at much later hours than usual), and a general feeling of tiredness. A general lack of recollection regarding what day of the week it was, as well as a change in the perceived flow of time were also notable. All these findings indicate the decline in mental health of students due to the lockdown. Promoting better sleep routines, minimizing the use of digital media, and encouragement of students to take up more hobbies could collectively improve the health and mood of students in self quarantine.",

In the third section, their sleep patterns were assessed. A series of close ended questions were asked in order to obtain details of the duration and quality of sleep, feelings of insomnia, and the change in number of dreams experienced. The fourth section was on digital media usage which investigated the hours spent on digital media, status of online classes, and frequency of exposure to COVID-19 related news. The final section on mental health was included so that we could check the impact of changes in time awareness, sleeping pattern, and digital media usage on the mental health status of students in Sindh.",

The emotional exhaustion that the participants experienced due to family conflicts is a possible hypothesis for the increased negative dreaming frequency, a topic which should be explored in future studies. Furthermore, participants who reported having dreamt more than usual had also reported sleeping for extended periods. Results from other findings confirm that sleeping for longer periods results in increased REM (Rapid Eye Movement) states [26] . It is also well-known that REM sleep has a vital role in processing emotional experiences from waking-life, strongly contributing to long-term storage of emotional memory [26] . This is why dreams experienced during the REM stage are more likely to be recalled [12] . For the participants who had reported to have felt tired and/or unmotivated, and could not tell what day of the week it was, it can be discerned that there is a correlation between negative emotions of the students and their memories, as explained and explored by Schweizer et al.

This result contradicted many other old research papers that reported the opposite [13, 32] . The likely explanation would be that these studies were conducted before the quarantine. While evaluating associations of media usage with sleep duration, SOL (\"sleep onset latency\") was the most determining factor in these studies. As mentioned by Touitou et al., waking time was almost constant among adolescents because school started early in the morning. Late-onset of sleep and fixed waking early in the morning resulted in a shortened sleep duration. However, due to lockdown and closed educational institutions, participants in our study were not bound in any such way of waking early in the morning. Therefore, it can be established that participants in our research, using excessive media, possibly found it harder and longer to fall asleep (as previous studies indicate) but later compensated it with a long wake up time, thus having prolonged sleep duration. Furthermore, due to the lockdown, most of these students had not gone out for many days unless necessary, and so were living under very different conditions than those of the previous studies. These factors may have collectively worked together to produce the seemingly anomalous results.",

Bedtime procrastination is defined as \"failing to go to bed at the intended time, even if no external circumstances prevent a person from doing so\" [16] . Many previous findings have found significant associations of bedtime procrastination with insufficient and low quality sleep [16, 20] . However, contrary to the findings of [16, 20] , we did not find any significant association. This may have been because most of the respondents had received enough sleep; 47% slept for longer periods during quarantine, 35.1% reported their sleep lengths to be variable, and 17.9% claimed they were not sleeping for longer durations. Furthermore, it is also important to highlight that our sample population is different from those of previous findings, as we were targeting students [Age group: 14-24]. This age group has been proven to have better sleep quality than older age groups [31] , which possibly makes up for the effect that bedtime procrastination has on sleep quality. Hence, it is safe to assume that our results, in this case, are justifiable. This finding is well substantiated by Lund et al., who correctly puts forth other predictors of bedtime delay amongst college students (other than low quality and insufficient sleep) such as academic stress or incompetent physical health [18] .",

In this study, self-reported lack of motivation, tiredness, and frequency of getting involved with family conflictsall of which come under DSM-V criteria of mental health problems [14]were significantly positively related to media usage after controlling all co-variates. This was consistent with a similar study from Wuhan [10] . This correlation could be due to the spread of misinformation comprising of rumors, false reports and stories, and \"conspiracy theories\" which people are being bombarded with online social media every day [2, 5] . Television programs in Pakistan are not thoroughly fact-checked [5] . Simultaneously, the reported use of hyperbolic/inappropriate words that only enhance fear and anxiety among the population has also increased [5] . All this negativity portrayed on social media is quite communicable [24, 21] and can be detrimental to people's mental health [15] . To fight the spread of this misinformation, The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) team is currently working with national institutions to make valid COVID-19 related information more accessible to the Pakistani population [41] . An excellent way to deal with this current situation is to host television, or social media live sessions and programs comprising of health workers and mental health professionals who can give reliable advice on how to follow the standard operating procedures best and offer words of encouragement to help boost the morale of the people [1] .",

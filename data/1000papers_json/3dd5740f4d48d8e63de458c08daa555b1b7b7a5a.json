Both 161 cameras are very compact and allow imaging of complete Petri plates from a 162 short distance without fisheye distortion effects, a feature crucial for 163 quantitative comparison of seed and seedling measurements. In our 164 experience, both configurations deliver the same image quality, and while the 165 first configuration is somewhat cheaper, the second one is more convenient. Notably, the first configuration can be relatively easily upgraded into the 167 second. Furthermore, SPIRO is compatible with a range of MPI CSI (Mobile 168 Industry Processor Interface Camera Serial Interface) cameras, which 169 implementation might require minimal modifications of the camera house. As 170 new cameras are being continuously developed, we strongly recommend 171 checking the SPIRO Hardware repository for potential upgrades. 172 SPIRO's electronics layout (File S2) is optimized to enable all essential 174 features for robust high-throughput imaging while minimizing costs and 175 assembling complexity. SPIRO is powered by the cheap and readily available 176 Raspberry Pi 3B+ single-board computer 14 that controls the other four 177 components: a camera, stepper motor, positional sensor (mini microswitch) 178 and LED light source. SPIRO's software and acquired images are hosted on a 179 microSD card mounted on the Raspberry Pi computer and can be remotely 180 accessed via Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Notably, Raspberry Pi is an open 181 source computer platform designed for development of engineering solutions 182 and is supported by a vivid community. Raspberry Pi is compatible with a 183 multitude of electronics modules, sensors and components, often 184supplemented with suitable software packages 18 .

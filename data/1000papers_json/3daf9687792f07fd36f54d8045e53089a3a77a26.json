Five clinical trials were included in the meta-analysis and standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated for each trial and pooled across studies using a random effects model. The overall effect estimates were not statistically significant in follow-up measurements at three months (SMD= 0.02, 95% CI= -0.36, 0.40; P=0.92), four months (SMDs= -1.11, 95% CI= -2.60, 0.38; P=0.14) and six months (SMD= -0.11, 95% CI= -0.54, 0.32; P=0.61).

We therefore conducted meta-analyses for similar study designs i.e. clinical trials but separated them based on the follow-up measurement periods. Thus, we undertook a separate meta-analysis for each follow-up measurement at three, four and six months after the intervention. In addition, we ran meta-analyses when there were at least two or more studies for the same outcome or the same follow-up period (55) . We therefore did not run a meta-analysis for follow-up measurements at 12 months reported in two studies because they involved different study designs i.e. an RCT with intervention and control groups (40) and a pre and post intervention study with only intervention group(56) to avoid increase in the heterogeneity (47) . Thus, we also avoided the overestimation of the effect of intervention in the absence of a control group (57) in the pre and post intervention study (56). In addition, we did not conduct sensitivity analyses due to the small number of studies in meta-analyses at each follow-up point (55) . We had only one pre-post study and we did not run metaanalysis for this study because meta-analysis cannot be run with only one study (47).",

When the number of studies is less, the Egger's test has low power and it fails to differentiate chance from real asymmetry. (47) . Similarly, assessing publication bias by Funnel plots with fewer studies would be of very limited usefulness because it would be difficult to spot the publication bias. We had three studies maximum in a meta-analysis (Fig. 2) ; hence, we could not check the publication bias by either method.",

Table 2 presents loneliness scores measured in the intervention and control groups, if any, at the baseline and follow-ups. Narrative synthesis showed that there was reduction in loneliness in the intervention groups at the follow-ups compared to at the baseline ( Table 2) .

Our findings might suggest that DTIs do not reduce loneliness in adults, which is opposite to a commonly held view that digital technology can solve the problem of loneliness, especially in older people. However, the digital technologies are tools and means to social connectedness, which may help in lessening loneliness for a little while because the effects of DTIs are short-lived and do not last beyond six months of the intervention (66). In addition, digital technologies might provide digital social connection but in fact they reduce social connectedness in real life (67) .

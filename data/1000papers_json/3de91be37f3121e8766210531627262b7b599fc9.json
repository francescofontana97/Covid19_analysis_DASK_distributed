It was expected that there would be greater fall in trauma cases during lockdown as because population would be undertaking fewer risky activities and there would be less motor vehicle accidents. Many authors have mentioned about the definitive change in aetiology of trauma during pandemic. They have even hypothesized that there would be less number of work related and road traffic injuries because of lockdown. But instead our study showed that there is mild rise in trauma cases. This can partially be explained by increase in activity level of children in household as they were not going to school during lockdown. Increasing number of alcohol related fall injuries during lockdown also explains mild rise in trauma cases during lockdown. Health posts and local clinics were almost closed during lockdown period and referral to tertiary care hospital has been increased during this period. There is growing interests of researchers on observational studies to understand factors, challenges and response to this pandemic among orthopaedic services throughout the world. [6] [7] [8] [9] Karnali Academy of Health Sciences is the largest tertiary care centre and is a referral hospital for more than 6 districts of Karnali Province. It's very difficult to conclude the status of orthopaedic care during COVID pandemic in Nepal as there is no any comparative studies published on impact of orthopaedic and trauma services in our country till now. There was strict lockdown throughout the nation for long, so there is clear-cut reduction in number of patients visiting in orthopaedic department of Karnali Academy of Health Sciences. As in many centres throughout Nepal, elective cases were halted in our centre. Various strategies were adapted by orthopaedic surgeon to combat this pandemic all over the world. [10] [11] [12] Many countries have adopted the policy of cessation of elective and non-urgent orthopaedic surgeries during pandemic. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] There is 90% reduction in elective cases (implant removal) in our setup which correspond to the article published by various authors on Covid 19 and orthopaedic services. 4 Minimization in hospitalisation of patient and clinical appointment, effective continuation of emergency attendances and proper guiding of staffs and resources deployment for the sustenance of emergency service was done as in other studies.",

There are 2288 patient during six Non COVID month and 1618 cases during six COVID month (29.2% reduction in total patient) in outpatient department of orthopaedic and trauma. Proportion of male and female patient coming to OPD during both periods is almost same (2288 male during Non COVID Period and 1618 male patient during COVID Period). Reduction in number of patients during COVID period is probably because of strict lockdown all over the country. Cessation of elective services and lockdown are the main causes of reduction of number of patient in out-patient department. However, despite of lockdown, proportion of fracture cases out of total case increased from 691 cases (16.1%) during non COVID period to 827 (27%) during COVID period. This is because of reduction of total number of non-urgent cases in outpatient department.",

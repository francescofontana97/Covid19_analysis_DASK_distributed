We present five consecutive cases of fetal death J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof (>12 weeks) without other putative causes in women with laboratory-confirmed (RT-PCR) COVID-19 managed in a single Brazilian institution. Case series: All five women were outpatients with mild or moderate forms of COVID-19 and were not taking any medication. Four were nulliparous, all were overweight or obese, and none had any comorbidities or pregnancy complications that could contribute to fetal demise. Fetal death occurred at 21-38 weeks of gestation, on COVID-days 1-22. SARS-Cov-2 was detected by RT-PCR in amniotic fluid in one case and in placental specimens in two cases. All five women had acute chorioamnionitis on placental histology, massive deposition of fibrin, mixed intervillitis/villitis, and intense neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration. One fetus had neutrophils inside alveolar spaces, suggestive of fetal infection. Conclusions: These five cases of fetal demise in women with confirmed COVID-19 without any other significant clinical or obstetric disorders suggest that fetal death can be an outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy. The intense placental inflammatory reaction in all five cases raises the possibility of a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the placenta.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "US: Ultrasound, Z-STORCH: Zika, syphillis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets.

The intense placental inflamatory reaction in all five cases, including villitis and intervillitis, raises the possibility of a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the placenta. The identification of SARS-CoV-2 in one amniotic fluid and two placental samples supports this hypothesis. The only fetus submitted to autopsy had signs of fetal infection. Placental histology indicated acute chorioamnionitis in all five cases. Two cases had massive deposition of intervillous fibrin associated with mixed intervillitis and villitis, and intense neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration. These findings are described in villitis of unknown etiology (VUE). VUE is related to hematogenous the paucity of reports, it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first or second trimesters increases the risks of adverse fetal outcomes, including stillbirth. Hantoushzadeh et al reported four fetal deaths in Iranian women with severe COVID-19, with three maternal deaths.(10) Baud et al reported a late miscarriage in a French woman with a mild form of COVID-19 at 19 weeks of gestation. The authors identified SARS-Cov-2 in the placenta but not in the fetus or amniotic fluid, and reported mixed inflamatory infiltrate on placental histology which they interpreted as a sign of possible placental infection by the virus.(9) Similarly, all our cases of fetal death occurred in outpatients with relatively mild forms of COVID-19, including an asymptomatic woman, and all cases had histological signs of intense placental inflammation. Although the exact mechanisms of intrauterine SARS-CoV-2 transmission are unclear, there are two hypotheses.(8) Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a possible surface receptor of sensitive cells for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in human placentas. This could explain placental infection by the virus.(17, 18) Another possible explanation for intrauterine SARS-CoV-2 infection is through placental barrier damage caused by severe maternal hypoxemia in women with COVID-19.(19)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Five cases of fetal death in women with COVID-19", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Characteristics </td><td>Case 1 </td><td>Case 2 </td><td>Case 3 </td><td>Case 4 </td><td>Case 5 </td></tr><tr><td>Age, years </td><td>32 </td><td>35 </td><td>40 </td><td>24 </td><td>30 </td></tr><tr><td>Parity </td><td>G1P0 </td><td>G2P1 </td><td>G2P0 </td><td>G1P0 </td><td>G3P0 </td></tr><tr><td>BMI category </td><td>Obese </td><td>Overweight </td><td>Obese </td><td>Overweight </td><td>Overweight </td></tr><tr><td>Diagnosis of COVID-19 (positive RT-PCR) </td><td> COVID </td><td> COVID </td><td>Asymptomatic </td><td>COVID </td><td>COVID </td></tr><tr><td>day#4 </td><td>day#6 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>day#1 </td><td>day#7 </td></tr><tr><td>Diagnosis of fetal </td><td>COVID day#14 </td><td>COVID day#6 </td><td>Asymptomatic </td><td>COVID </td><td>COVID </td></tr><tr><td>death </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>day#22 f\n</td><td>day#11) </td></tr><tr><td>GA at fetal death, weeks </td><td> 28 3/7 </td><td>21 1/7 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>o23 4/7 </td><td>30 6/7 </td></tr><tr><td>Birth weight </td><td>1070 g </td><td>329 g </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>680 g </td><td>1430 g </td></tr><tr><td>RT-PCR in placenta  and AF </td><td>Placenta: positive AF: not performed </td><td>Placenta: not performed AF: not performed </td><td>Placenta: not performed AF: not performed </td><td>Placenta: positive AF: positive </td></tr><tr><td>Placental and fetal histopathology </td><td>Intense acute villitis and intervillitis.

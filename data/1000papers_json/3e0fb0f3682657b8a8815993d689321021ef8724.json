The form \"map\", in fact, translates in two-dimensionally and with an abstract language the complexity of the space that we perceived and interact with through our physicality. In this process of conceptualisation many of our visceral abilities must be distilled into a form of representation that elects vision as a privileged channel. The possibility of using mobile devices has widened the range of expression and the ways in which we orient people in the environment. But, well beyond this instrumental function, the use of the acoustic channel, for example, opens up design scenarios for the construction of an identity of places that involves users from the point of view of experiential richness. Generally used to give procedural indications and free the user in movements, the sound interface has in itself further potential for exploring the communicative design and reading of the anthropic environment. The paper proposes an interpretation of the urban landscape of the city of Milan and its historical transformation through the narrative key of one of the major Italian novels and the construction of soundscapes that gives back the emotional richness of reality. Based on a holophonic recording, the prototype of the mobile app explores the possibility of extending a space-contextual experience through a multimodal storytelling that generates \"sound vision\".",

On the one hand, the visceral component is how we react to sensory elements, i.e. what can be perceived by our senses: visual, acoustic, tactile, taste or olfactory. The primordial reactions to these stimuli have kept us safe. They let us \"decide\" in an almost immediate timespan what is good and what is bad, what is safe and what is dangerous for us and our survival.

To design for visceral level \"is actually for affectthat is, eliciting the appropriate psychological or emotional response for a particular contextrather than for aesthetic alone.\" underline Alan Cooper [3] . That not the place to debate the different positions, but empirical and experimental studies conducted in the digital field have definitively shown that people find that what is beautiful is also useful. Specifically, Kurosu and Kashimura [4] introduced the concept of apparent usabilityopposite to usability [5] to describe the pleasantness that some interfaces were able to convey to users when compared to just usable ones. It has been Tratchinsky [6] together with Katz and Ikar [7] who explicitly referred to beautiful as component appreciated by people when using digital systems aimed to be experimentally tested. Emotional or visceral aspects, therefore, are essential and useful to users when facing the challenge to interact with complex systems and, in particular, with digital technologies.

But the two-dimensional surface of displays tends to dramatically reduce the potentialities of physical interactions to a singular sense, the vision according to the Graphical User interface pattern and its language and metaphors. Touch devices, as well, use this sense to mediate through a flattened space our experience of the surrounding environment both physical and on-line.

The investments made by big tech companies -Facebook in Oculus Drift and Microsoft with HoloLensreveals a grooving niche opening new design opportunities and challenges in a blended environment where virtual, augmented and mixed reality are promising field to be explored. The revamp of virtual reality after the decline of the last almost 30 yearsis opening the opportunity to create richer interactions. The 3D simulation (or based on real photos) let people explore a simulative space where reality can be replay or (re)invented [9] .

Already in 1969 Southworth introduces the concept of soundscape in his research on the relationship between acoustic and visual perception of space: \"Two aspects of the soundscape that appear particularly important in city perception were central to the study. First, we evaluated the identity of the sounds, including (a) the uniqueness or singularity of local sounds in relation to those of other city settings and (b) their informativeness or the extent to which a place's activity and spatial form were communicated by sound.\" [10] . The experimental study he conducted in those years is even more significant for the type of subjects involvedblind or deafwhich emphasise even more the close relationship between the different factors of urban perception. The theoretical definition of the concept of \"soundscape\", however, is attributed to Canadian composer Raymond Murray Schafer in the 1970s. It indicates everything that makes up the acoustic environment. The soundscape is made up of all the acoustic, natural and artificial resources within a given area from the environment. A sound \"photograph\" of the environment. According to Schafer, the soundscape is generally composed of 3 different elements:",

To better understand the concept these concepts, it is possible to refer to Krause's studies. An American musician and ecologist of the soundscape, who during a TED Global, explains the three music sources that contribute to the composition of a natural soundscape: \"The soundscape is made up of three basic sources. The first is the geophony, or the nonbiological sounds that occur in any given habitat, like wind in the trees, water in a stream, waves at the ocean shore, movement of the Earth. The second of these is the biophony. The biophony is all the sound that is generated by organisms in a given habitat at one time and in one place. And the third is all of the sound that we humans generate that is called anthrophony. Some of it is controlled, like music or theater, but most of it is chaotic and incoherent, which some of us refer to as noise.\" [15, 16] . Moreover, in relation to these 3 elements of the soundscape, Krause states that there is an important interaction between biophony and the other sources of sound: geophony and anthropophony. For instance, several studies, particularly those in process by Nadia Pieretti at Urbino University, have shown that birds alter their vocalizations to accommodate themselves to urban noise. And killer whales (Orcinus orca) do the same with boat noise in their marine environments. According Bernie Krause \"The soundscape concept consists of what I call signature sources, meaning that each type of sound, from whatever origin, contains its own unique signature, or quality, one that inherently contains vast stores of information. That individual signature is unlike any other. So, also, is the natural soundscape unique in its collective state, especially as it becomes the voice of an entire habitat.",

So, the soundscape is part of the context that affects human existence. This relationship between sound and place is a way of thinking about everyone's responsibility in the \"composition\" of the shared sound landscape [18] . This \"reading of the world\" through a specific acoustic scenario turns out to be a fundamental element for the construction and success of the project. Through the activation of the sound, the user is transported in time and space in another era, thus allowing a totally new use of that place. In this case the effect that we try to reproduce is narrative: evoking situations and contents extraneous to the user. The intent is to create a plausible environment from an acoustic point of view.

At a technical level, this sound modifies some classic parameters in the audio recording system: instead of using two microphones, one for the right channel and one for the left channel, as in the case of the stereo, a plastic head is used in which are inserted, in correspondence to the auricles, of the microphone capsules called \"holophones\", capable of capturing the sound coming from any direction, all trying to simulate the auditory capacities of the human head. In this way the brain introduces a slowness in the auditory reception: if the sound is perceived on the right, it will be perceived on the left only after a significant delay, causing the head to act as if it were a resonance box (Fig. 1 ).",

The Final Cut was recorded using \"holophonics\" -an audio processing technique used to enhance the aural three-dimensional 'feel' of the recording. Holophonics was used to make sound effects on the album appear more three-dimensional to the listener -sound effects, particularly when heard on headphones, appear to pass not just from left to right in the stereo spectrum but also from in front to behind of the listener and around them. Perhaps the most notable use of holophonics on the album is on the song Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert -during the intro, an airplane is heard to fly swiftly overhead, passing from in front of the listener to behind them, before a huge explosion from the bomb it has dropped is heard surrounding the listener both in front and behind them and to either side of the stereo picture. The use of this technique was in keeping with Pink Floyd's long-standing interest in using atmospheric sound effects combined with advances and innovations in audio technology to enhance the listener's experience of their music. It was also claimed that this process could not be duplicated if one made a copy of the recording i.e., copying from the vinyl record to tape cassette [23] . Despite the great innovation, this type of technology is known by very few and has never reached the apex of success, probably due to system difficulties: the inconvenient use of the plastic head and the obligation to use headphones to warn the effect.",

Precisely for this reason, each user is able to view the immersive context presented by the two soundscapes, defining a precise context. Hardly, however, will have experienced a situation like that of the Lazzaretto in the seventeenth century (a field of dying people affected by the plague). Having never experienced situation like that, and therefore difficult for him to visualise and physically connotate, the external user experiences what he feels through emotions. In parallel to this first qualitative evaluation, it would be interesting to expand the test by involving other parameters. Besides, the correlation between the impact of the sound experience relative to the single place was investigated, using the emotions aroused by the different historical thresholds. A wider investigation could explore, vicevesa, the relationship and frequency of words expressed in relation to places.",

On the one hand, the forms of reality mediated by technologyaugmented, virtual, mixed or blendallow an exploration that tries to reproduce the three-dimensionality of the world or to enter into a direct relationship with it. On the other hand, the perspectives opened up by the Voice User Interfaces and, in general, by the use of the acoustic channel offer a range and a language to explode to designers. The combination of these two factors in mobility creates the scenario to transform space-related data into a narrative concept to be explored using one's own senses. An opportunity to discover a spatial identity played on new parameters -the soundscape -and not only on the \"image of the city\". Besides, the three-dimensionality of the holophonic technique also plays on the role that spatiality and haptic interactions play in the complexity of our knowledge process. The situational context, the plasticity of the experience reconstructs the emotional connection with the territory and its genius loci in a process of transformation of data into experience, of space into a place, of history into a narration.",

Furthermore, oral TXA is easy to access and administer, which decreases the workload of nurses and even delivers cost-saving benefits to the health care system. We thus conclude that oral TXA may be an optimal approach in total joint arthroplasty. However, more high-quality and multicenter RCTs are still needed to confirm our conclusions.",

            "text": "Total hip and knee arthroplasty are known as one of the most successful surgeries for relieving pain and improving physical function. However, perioperative blood loss is one of the major complications following total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). [1, 2] There are several steps used to minimize blood loss in patients who undergo THA and TKA, such as use of a tourniquet, deliberate hypotension, antifibrinolytics, cell salvage, etc. Among these strategies, tranexamic acid (TXA) has been identified as a useful step in reducing the blood loss and the transfusion rate in THA and TKA. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Patients undergoing THA and TKA can receive TXA intravenously (IV), topically, or orally. [8] Some studies have reported that both IV and topical administration were effective in reducing perioperative blood loss without increasing thrombotic complications after THA and TKA. [9, 10] However, IV administration of TXA increases the workload of nurses, the cost, and the risk of anaphylactic reaction compared with oral TXA. [11] Topical TXA administration carries a theoretical risk of periprosthetic infection due to contamination of the needle and dispensing process, [12] and the topical form may increase the risk of forming clots and blocking drainage tubes. Oral TXA administration is easy to access and administer, which decreases the workload of nurses, and its absorption is quick and complete. Additionally, the cost could decrease dramatically with oral TXA administration. The ideal route of TXA administration remains controversial. [13, 14] Recently, researchers have paid more attention to oral TXA administration. [9, 15] However, the efficacy and safety of oral TXA remain controversial because of the small number of clinical studies. [16] To our knowledge, this is the first metaanalysis and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) analysis of only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the safety and efficacy of oral TXA and IV TXA in primary THA and TKA. We found 4 metaanalyses [17] [18] [19] [20] comparing oral TXA and IV TXA administration in primary THA and TKA. However, the inclusion criteria of the previous 4 meta-analyses included retrospective cohort studies that may involved recall and interviewer bias. Thus, based on the current RCTs comparing oral and IV TXA, we used the GRADE system to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome and conducted a meta-analysis of RCTs to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of oral and IV administration of TXA.",

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis and GRADE analysis of only RCTs comparing the safety and efficacy of oral TXA and IV TXA in primary THA and TKA. We found 4 meta-analyses [17] [18] [19] [20] comparing oral TXA and IV TXA administration in primary THA and TKA. However, the inclusion criteria of the previous 4 meta-analyses included retrospective cohort studies that may involved recall and interviewer bias. Thus, based on the current RCTs comparing oral TXA and IV TXA in THA and TKA, we reviewed the highest evidence-based (level I) studies systematically and conducted a meta-analysis of RCTs to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of oral TXA and IV TXA in THA and TKA, with more convincing results. We used the GRADE system to evaluate the quality of the evidence for each outcome, and the quality of each outcome was relatively high. Moreover, our results included drain output and the incidence of calf muscular vein thrombosis and deep vein thrombosis, which could supplement previous meta-analyses. The results of our meta-analysis is consistent with the previous 4 meta-analysis in which Oral TXA has similar effects on reducing the Hb drop, total blood loss, transfusion rate, drain blood loss, and length of hospital stay without increasing the risk of CMVT and DVT. The Hb drop and total blood loss were the primary outcomes in our meta-analysis. Many studies [23, 25, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] demonstrated that oral TXA provides similar reductions in Hb drop and total blood loss in primary THA and TKA compared with IV TXA. The results of this study found no significant differences in Hb drop and total blood loss between oral and IV TXA. Our meta-analysis results are consistent with the findings of 2 recent meta- Table 3 The detailed characteristics of the TXA administration.",

[8, 10] Taking these findings together and given that the results were of high quality according to the GRADE evidence, we conclude that oral TXA has the same effects on reducing Hb drop and total blood loss as the IV form. Blood transfusion is associated with adverse effects, including hemolytic reactions, infections, morbidity, immunologically mediated diseases, and cost. [33] Many RCTs [24] [25] [26] 28] found no significant difference between the 2 routes of administration following total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Their results were consistent with our findings. The results were of high quality according to the GRADE evidence. We conclude that compared with IV administration, the use of oral TXA has the same effects as IV TXA on the transfusion rate following THA and TKA. [31, 32] Drain output may contribute to allogenic blood transfusion and increased complications according to our meta-analysis.",

There was no significant difference between oral TXA versus IV TXA in drain blood loss, which is consistent with our findings.

In China, the oral TXA cost was approximately 4 < per dose compared with 23< per dose for IV TXA, which results in a much larger cost difference than that reported by Kayupov et al.

Second, the different doses and administration times of oral TXA among the included studies might be a problem when comparing the results.

Furthermore, oral TXA is easy to access and administer, which decreases the workload of nurses and even delivers cost-saving benefits to the health care system. We thus conclude that oral TXA is an optimal approach in TJA. However, more high-quality and multicenter RCTs are still needed to reach a firmer conclusion.",

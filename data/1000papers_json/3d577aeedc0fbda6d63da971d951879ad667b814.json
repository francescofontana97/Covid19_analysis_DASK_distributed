The American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society define AECOPD clinically as an episode of increased respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and increased sputum purulence. 3 These issues are also reflected in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)",

Early predictors of AECOPD could help to develop novel therapeutic treatment options and strategies, to prevent acute exacerbations in the future for patients with COPD.",

Patients will be recruited during an inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme at the reference centre of the Philipps University Marburg: Schoen Klinik Berchtesgadener Land at Schoenau am Koenigssee (Germany). From an own former retrospective analysis in 401 patients with very severe COPD, we learnt that 15.2% of these patients develop an AECOPD during their stay in the clinic. 19 Therefore, the setting of an inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation offers a unique model to study the phenomenon of an AECOPD prior to the first visible clinical sign and further on to have a follow-up of the underlying mechanisms. All patients with COPD who are referred to the reference centre for a rehabilitation programme will be included after providing written informed consent. Prospectively, a wide range of measurements will be collected (figure 1). If a patient develops an AECOPD, there will be an additional comprehensive diagnostic assessment to differentiate between pulmonary, cardiac or cardiopulmonary reasons for the acute exacerbation (table 1). The diagnosis of an AECOPD will be made clinically by an experienced pulmonologist within the first 24 hours according to the Anthonisen criteria with the occurrence of at least two symptoms among sputum volume, sputum purulence and breathlessness. 20 Study objectives Primary endpoint To prospectively identify potential early, respiratory and or cardiac clinical predictors, laboratory parameters, breath print analyses and/or changes in lung function, symptoms and physical activity prior to an AECOPD in patients with COPD.",

Hence, efforts are ongoing to bring biological assessment to the point of care. If properly validated, molecular profiling of exhaled air may provide a non-invasive and rapid alternative for blood and sputum. 24 VOCs in exhaled air have been associated with inflammatory profiles in asthma 25 26 and COPD. 27 For VOC analysis 2, different approaches will be used: 1. Analysis by ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) (BioScout IMS, B&S Analytik, Dortmund, Germany) will be performed. The IMS technology is fast and easy to use. Patients exhale directly into the IMS device where only low volumes of exhalation are needed for analysis. IMS has a great potential to proceed to become a point-ofcare tool that produces characteristic disease-related breath profiles. 28 2. Analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS): we will collect breath samples on adsorption tubes for the analysis by GC/MS, 29 30 using the novel ReCIVA sampler system (Owlstone medical, UK).

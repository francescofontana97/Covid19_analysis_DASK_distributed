Although various hypothesis and theories have been previously generated, yet case studies validating them by real-life examples have been scarce. This research paper serves as an exploratory qualitative research, based on a single case study with a retail company established in Lebanon: The United Company for Central Markets SARL (UCCM). The grocery retail industry is a good example because it's changing faster than most other complex industries, making it harder to detect and keep any competitive advantage. The study on hand aims to inductively develop theory further, and reflects UCCM's results by illustrating an enriched conceptual framework for understanding how efficient CRM systems, when integrated with DAC, can enhance Marketing decisions during times of crisis management. UCCM's research design and decision-making process allow addressing DAC as a new key dimension for the enriched conceptual framework. UCCM's results also clarify how DAC play a crucial integrative role in adding value to the three factors of a CRM successful implementation: People, Technology and Process. The enriched conceptual framework proves to be a valuable heuristic tool that highlights the importance of establishing and acquiring a new skill set of competencies that combine Marketing with technologies and data analytics, especially during times of crisis management.",

Therefore, firms implementing CRM systems are seeking backup for their customer-oriented strategies and systems.

Operational CRM manages the relationship between customers and Front House contact points such as point of sales and customer service. Whereas collaborative CRM approach enables the integration and synchronized sharing of all customer interaction data within an organization, aiming at enhancing customers' satisfaction, loyalty and retention. Collaborative CRM allows organizations to build and regularly adjust shared strategies based on customers' needs, to service customers more efficiently and to maximize profitability and revenue. Furthermore, analytical CRM comprises the analysis and evaluation of all data collected using business intelligence functions (Chalmeta 2006) . Analysis of customer-related data is then integrated in business strategies such as: promotional campaigns, customer attrition, market analysis, customer behavior, lead analysis, customer interaction and loyalty.",

Khlif and Jallouli (2014)'s conceptual model for successful CRM investigated further the determinants of success along with their outcomes. Inspired by the above-mentioned approaches, this paper presents a conceptual framework developed in Fig. 1 and suggests the addition of DAC as a fourth variable to CSFs' dimensions for any firm implementing a successful CRM system. The addition of the fourth dimension to CSFs is crucial for any company: Constant changes in consumer behavior, intense market competition and updates in technology require that companies ensure proper data analytics capabilities and tools to increase efficiency in meeting customer requirements (Benslama and Jallouli 2020; Kaabi and Jallouli 2019; Kaabi and Jallouli 2019) . CRM systems can only be effective when all data gathered are translated into effective Marketing decisions and strategies that suit best customers' actual and forecasted needs. Therefore, skills and knowledge in technologies and data analytics capabilities must be upgraded to meet market changes (Bach Tobji et al. 2018 Jallouli et al. 2019; Kumar 2018) .",

The core business focuses on two sectors: retail and distribution, along with a differentiation strategy that seeks an internal culture of ownership nurtured in the services offered. Throughout the next four decades, the company expanded in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar, and established partnerships that enhance return on investments. In 2001, UCCM won over the management contract of Consumer Cooperatives 'COOP' supermarkets of Lebanon, jointly owned by the Public Sector and an autonomous association of persons, united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations.",

For example, the decision-making process of a new store concept was examined: In June 2020, after an instant financial feasibility study of the current trends and market needs, the BLT has identified an urgent need to create a new concept in densely populated areas, getting closer to customers' homes, yet selling at competitive prices. The new concept will be implemented during the third quarter of 2020: \"Mini-M\", a 50-70 sqm grocery retail store, located in densely populated neighborhoods in Beirut, and selling mainly the private labels' products. The execution of the new strategy shall support UCCM with: (1) adjusting to changing consumers' behaviors who need stores close to their homes and who are shifting to local cheaper brands due to economic challenges, (2) increasing market share by ensuring a wider presence in new areas, (3) increasing customers' awareness towards private label products, (4) selling at competitive prices: when buying in \"bulk\" from suppliers, unit cost will decrease, thus increasing profit margin. As of the first quarter of 2021, the new concept will be considered as the call center that will be integrated with the CRM system. Customers will be able to order online (or by phone from the nearest store). Financial data analytics prove to be efficient during crisis management, where shortterm, fast and efficient Marketing decisions are required. However, long-term social and environmental perspectives should be taken into consideration: Current market trends and economic situation encourages the online shopping experience along with the traditional in stores shopping. From a business perspective, digitalizing stores is beneficial on all levels: consumers' brand awareness is increased, access to products and sales are optimized, and lower costs result in increased profitability. As well, technology has the power of personalizing customers' experience through real-time data and various media platforms, delivering value as a result (Rund 2018) . Moreover, Kaabi and Jalouli (2019) explain that managing and monitoring an online shopping site involves E-Commerce (EC) techniques and tools such as SEM, recommender systems and chat bots aiming at maximizing websites' efficiency and collecting a huge amount of data. Cloud technologies are used to store and perform the collected data. Indeed, cloud computing provides \"the network platform and the infrastructure with high performance as services\" . Therefore, the enriched conceptual framework considers EC tools and techniques related to the process dimension and outlines the importance of integrating contextual analytics and data mining tools related to marketing and financial processes.",

Yet, UCCM and customers have both shown not ready to successfully interact through technological platforms on hand (Alstyne et al. 2016). The online shopping experience has proved to have a low self-relevance: customers find it difficult to identify their personae with the available brands in use (MacInnis and Folkes 2017). Up to date re-branding approaches as part of Marketing decisions and strategies were highlighted for in-stores and online shopping: For example, previous researches have assessed the impact of sensory information on processing of brand information (e.g., Krishna and Schwarz 2014) . Market trends indicate the increasing role of creating online personalized experience and brand awareness through multisensory and highly interactive new technologies that appeal to multiple senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell) simultaneously (Stone and O'Shea 2019).

            "text": "Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing contributes to Antimicrobial Resistance posing a major public health risk. Estimates suggest as many as half of antibiotics prescribed for respiratory infections may be unnecessary. We conducted a three-armed unblinded cluster randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN trial registry 83322985). Interventions were a commitment poster (CP) advocating safe antibiotic prescribing or a CP plus an antimicrobial stewardship message (AM) on telephone appointment booking lines, tested against a usual care control group. The primary outcome measure was antibiotic item dispensing rates per 1000 population adjusted for practice demographics. The outcome measures for post-hoc analysis were dispensing rates of antibiotics usually prescribed for upper respiratory tract infections and broad spectrum antibiotics. In total, 196 practice units were randomized to usual care (n = 60), CP (n = 66), and CP&AM (n = 70). There was no effect on the overall dispensing rates for either interventions compared to usual care (CP 5.673, 95%CI \u22129.768 to 21.113, p = 0.458; CP&AM, \u221212.575, 95%CI \u221230.726 to 5.576, p = 0.167). Secondary analysis, which included pooling the data into one model, showed a significant effect of the AM (\u221218.444, 95%CI \u221232.596 to \u22124.292, p = 0.012). Fewer penicillins and macrolides were prescribed in the CP&AM intervention compared to usual care (\u221212.996, 95% CI \u221234.585 to \u22124.913, p = 0.018). Commitment posters did not reduce antibiotic prescribing. An automated patient antimicrobial stewardship message showed effects and requires further testing.",

The clinician commitment posters were poster-sized letters from clinicians to patients stating the clinicians' commitment to appropriate antibiotic prescribing. Posters were signed by the clinician and included the clinician's photograph. Public commitments aim to influence behavior by increasing the salience and stability of the intentions relevant to the behavior [32] . Commitment making has been linked to an individual's need for self-consistency (a motivation to align our behavior with previous decisions, especially those which are made public) [33] . In addition, the motivation to protect one's public image may result in a stronger motivation to adhere to the public commitment [34] . It should be noted that the poster is expected to 'work' through the clinicians' commitment to the behavior described (in this case, appropriate antibiotic prescribing). It can also support clinicians' decisions during consultations as it can be referred to during consultations with patients. It is not intended to be a public health messaging poster aimed at patients. The simplicity and success of this intervention creates potential for a low-cost, scalable intervention and warrants testing in other contexts.",

A recent review on the behavioral drivers of patient antibiotic consumption proposed that interventions which require less reflective thought and more environmental cues on how to respond to symptoms of self-limiting infections could have good effects on behavior [20] . One example proposed was to use appointment-booking systems in General Practices as an opportunity to prime patients about appropriate antibiotic use by informing expectations for antibiotic prescriptions prior to the consultation. For example, by playing an automated antimicrobial stewardship message to patients before they reach the stage of appointment booking. Such point-of-choice prompts involve the disruption of habitual behavior through a change in contextual cues to action. The prompt interrupts automatic thinking and may lead to the substitution of one behavior for another [35] . This 'bottle neck', which every patient needs to pass through in order to access a GP and antibiotics, offers another low cost, scalable intervention giving patients the opportunity to consider alternative ways to respond to their symptoms. Targeting both patients and prescribers with antimicrobial stewardship interventions might be a more effective approach to reducing antibiotic prescribing and consumption than targeting just one group.",

The secondary analysis fitted models pooling the two interventions into a single model comparing each with usual care. As no practices delivered the AM alone, the first effects in the pooled analysis were interpreted as the effect of receiving the CP intervention and any additional effect of receiving the AM intervention. Two per-protocol analyses were carried out, firstly by excluding randomized practices who dropped out before the start of the trial and secondly by excluding practices with a poor fidelity (i.e., no response to fidelity checks or fewer than 100% of participating GPs per practice displaying posters or not implementing the AM). Models controlled for the number of GPs in the practice, the practice population size, and practice demographics. We explored the moderation effect of treatment by practice/participant demographics using the same model as the primary analysis, with an additional main effect and an interaction.

The primary analysis showed no statistically significant differences in antibiotic prescribing between the interventions and usual care. However, a statistically significant reduction in antibiotic prescribing was observed in response to the answer phone message when secondary analysis separated the effects from the commitment poster in a single model. Furthermore, sub-group analysis showed that the combined intervention caused a statistically significant reduction in the prescribing of antibiotics commonly used for upper respiratory tract infections. This is the first study to test an antibiotic prescribing commitment poster at scale in an English primary care setting. In contrast to the 19.7% reduction in unnecessary antibiotic prescribing seen using a similar intervention in the US, we found no such effects. Smaller effects were expected in the present study, as we measured overall antibiotic prescribing rather than \"inappropriate\" prescribing, as in the original study by Meeker et al. [26] . However, this difference is unlikely to explain the lack of effect observed.",

Whilst many of these reported barriers to prudent antibiotic prescribing are similar in England and the US, one important difference is the consultation length, with a norm of 10 min in England compared to 20 min in the US. Therefore, it is possible that despite the good intentions, UK prescribers were unable to enact their commitments due to competing demands during the consultation and workload pressures, as has frequently been cited by UK GPs [44, 45] . A short consultation length has previously been associated with the overuse of antibiotics [46] [47] [48] .",

Meeker, personal communication, August 11, 2017) . Hence, we cannot be certain that clinicians saw the poster and actively committed to its contents or whether this was always completed by an intermediary. This lower level of engagement in the intervention may have affected the prescriber's engagement in the commitment. Research shows that active public commitments (e.g., the act of signing the poster) are more effective than passive commitments [39, 40] .

The limitations of this study include an insufficient sample size for a factorial design, and the inability to interpret this study as a direct replication due to additional elements in the poster and delivery mode of the intervention. Indeed, the remote delivery of the intervention may have impacted the fidelity with which the intervention was implemented-fidelity checks were self-reports about whether the poster was displayed correctly, as opposed to whether the prescriber engaged in the commitment poster. The sample was a convenience sample and the practices may not represent national practices (for example, antibiotic prescribing rates in our sample increased in 2016, whereas nationally, the rate was declining [7] ). Additionally, as it was not possible to determine treatment indication like in the Meeker et al. trial, it is possible that this contributed to the difference in findings. A process evaluation with prescribers who took part in this study is reported separately. A final limitation is the high drop-out rate post-randomization.

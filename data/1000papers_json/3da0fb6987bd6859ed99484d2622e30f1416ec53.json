Additionally, neurological symptoms can occur as a complication secondary to systemic illnesses or from the exacerbation of preexisting neurological conditions. Neurological manifestations include symptoms reflecting the overall severity of the disease (as documented by encephalitis and encephalopathy) or more specific syndromic entities (e.g., stroke or Guillain-Barre syndrome) that might be the result of the peculiar mechanisms of action of the virus [Romero-Sanchez et al, 2020] .",

This variability can be mostly explained by the differing sources of cases (hospital vs. community-based), the accuracy of the diagnostic approach, and the subjective interpretation of the patients' complaints by the attending physicians. Thus, a standardised approach is needed to provide a clearer outline of the spectrum of neurological disorders comparing the main clinical aspects of COVID-19 disease in different countries and verify whether differences, if any, could be attributed to differences in environmental and genetic factors. The approach also allows for the evaluation of the severity of illness across resource settings to examine the role of critical illness or prolonged hospitalisation on symptoms and draw conclusions regarding causality between viral infection and neurological manifestations. A registry represents the ideal instrument for this purpose.",

A number of general symptoms and signs of infection, a list of prominent comorbidities and a number of neurological diseases, selected among those identified in previous series and case-reports and accompanied by proper definitions, have been included in a semistructured case report form (Table 1) . All registered patients with neurological symptoms are asked to be followed for 12 months, with telephone calls at six and 12 months to verify the vital status, the functional abilities and identify neurological symptoms, signs or diagnoses that might have occurred after the acute phase of the disease.

            "text": "The GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium also developed a paediatrics study arm to examine neurologic features of COVID-19 across the full lifespan. Currently, GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium has 123 adult and 96 paediatric sites representing all continents. The similarities in scientific aims and the complimentary global outreach of the two large consortia (EAN and GCS-NeuroCOVID) generated an ideal opportunity for global collaboration. The two consortia plan to combine data in a general analysis which will provide important information on global and regional burden of neurological manifestations of COVID-19 pandemic. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) outlining terms of this collaboration was established and jointly signed by leaders of the EAN and the Neurocritical Care Society and the Neurocritical Care Research Network. This collaboration led to the planning of joint activities aimed at promoting harmonisation of data collection, to be extended to children and adolescents, and to include a more detailed search of data during follow-up. At the same time, the World Health Organization (WHO) promoted a global forum aimed at identifying the most important issues to be investigated at a global level, in terms of improved knowledge of the spectrum of COVID-19 infection and its neurological acute and late complications, and the detection of failures in the provision of care. Representatives from both the EAN and the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium investigators serve on this important mission.",

Nineteen patients had more than one CTPA during their admission. After further screening of the cases to remove duplicated hospital number or scans for reasons other than suspected PE, 310 CT scans remained. Of these, 214 were scans in patients for whom COVID-19 had been confirmed (n=145) or was clinically suspected (n=69) at the time of CTPA request. Cohort description: Of the 214 scans, n=80 (37%) confirmed PE. Therefore, from 1477 patients admitted with COVID-19, 5.4% were diagnosed with PE. The demographic and clinical features of those with and without PE are in Table 1. At the time of manuscript preparation, of n=214, n=36 patients were still receiving hospital treatment and 31 patients had died in hospital. Thirty-two patients had CTPA during a hospital readmission (readmitted within 90 days of discharge; median time to readmission 18.5 days [IQR 7-46 days]). Of these 32 CTPA, nine were positive for PE. Thirtyfour patients (16%) were receiving invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the time that CTPA was requested (sixteen of whom showed presence of PE). However, a further n=44 of the cohort subsequently received ICU care (20 with PE), making a total of 78 ICUtreated patients (Table 1) . Thus, the proportion of ICU patients with PE was 16.2%. There were no differences in the distribution of age, gender or body weight between groups. The median NEWS2 score was 5 (IQR 3 -9) in those with PE compared to NEWS2 of 4 (IQR 2 -7) in those without (P = 0.133). The incidence of PE in patients with ward-based care was 3.5% (of 1255 admissions to the ward level care). Eighty-two scans (38%) were performed within 24-hours of admission (of which n=31 showed PE); 26 scans (14%, n=4 showed PE) were performed at 24-72 hours. The range of imaging was 0-120 days: one patient having been admitted for over 2-months prior to the first case of COVID-19 recorded. Median duration from admission to imaging was 2 days. Of all admissions, 2.1% were diagnosed with PE within 24 hours of admission. Of the patients scanned after 24-hours of admission, 124 were receiving anticoagulation (predominantly weight based thromboprophylaxis, n= 95) from admission.

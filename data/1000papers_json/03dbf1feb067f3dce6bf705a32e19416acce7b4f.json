This test shows whether the residuals are randomly distributed. If 226 the null hypothesis is rejected, the OLS analysis needs to be adjusted to consider the 227 spatial effects. There are two main strategies to estimate spatial autoregressive models: 228 spatial lag and spatial error. The spatial lag model (also known as contagion model) 229 incorporates space as a right hand-side variable, estimating a coefficient for the spatial 230 effect; the error model does not incorporate spatial as a covariate, but includes it in the 231 structure of the residuals (81). Conceptually, spatial lag models seem more appropriate to 232 adjust for spatial autocorrelation in the case of infections, since it is expected that the 233 number of COVID-19 cases in one municipality affects the cases in the neighboring 234 areas, the contagion effects. However, this is not necessarily true for mortality, 235 particularly once controlling for the case incidence rate. In this case, a spatial error model 236 appears more suitable, since unobserved spatial effects are expected to drive the spatial 237 autocorrelation in the residuals. Consequently, spatially correlated regressions of cases 238 are adjusted using a spatial lag model, and an error model is utilized for the death 239 regressions.",

On the one hand, it simplifies the estimation by capturing 170 several socioeconomic factors into one variable, as used in other studies (68, 69).

The use of a 100-days period allows us to understand the evolution of the 434 disease so far but it is a snapshot of an ongoing issue. Additionally, better availability and 435 quality of data can help to understand the underlying factors behind the changes in outcomes. We proposed an imperfect indicator for measuring the speed of 437 changes. There are still relevant questions to answer in this line. Finally, the estimations 438 are based on municipalities' structural features; the understanding of COVID-19 439 outcomes can also improve by adding real-time variables related to people's behavior, 440 such as the percentage of people using face masks, or better data on mobility within and 441 between geographical areas. 442 We believe the analysis contributes to the worldwide effort for understanding the social 443 determinants and effects of the COVID-19.

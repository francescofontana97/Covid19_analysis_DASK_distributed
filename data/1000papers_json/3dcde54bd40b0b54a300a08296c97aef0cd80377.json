The importance of the medical device and pharmaceutical industries has been emphasized due to infectious diseases such as influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and coronavirus viral disease 2019 . In the case of COVID-19, the virus has serious adverse effects not only on human health but also the social economy. Thus, a diagnostic test device and a vaccine for the disease are being devised and demanded in countries around the world [1] [2] [3] . This is because medical devices and medicine for patient treatment are directly connected to each other. However, despite the importance of these industries, pharmaceutical companies are under significant pressure between the consumer associations that demand inexpensive products with good efficacy and investors who pursue high performance and profit [4] Interestingly, research and projects related to the pharmaceutical industry over the past two decades have been invested in discovering new drugs to generate profit [5] . However, as the cost for basic research and development (R&D) is gradually increased, much research and many projects at pharmaceutical companies were stopped [6] . Furthermore, poor R&D led to a decrease in the pharmaceutical industry's productivity. Specifically, changes in the industrial structure such as the rise of the biotechnology field contributed to the increase in R&D costs of pharmaceutical companies [7] . As productivity declines continue, the pharmaceutical industry is facing unprecedented industrial challenges and surveillance with the extinction of monopoly products and the reduction of pipelines caused by patent expiration [8] .",

For example, the number of mergers and acquisitions for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry in 2018 recorded a total of 1438 and a total volume of $339.6 billion as the highest in the last decade. The medical device industry, which is indicated as a major factor in the decline of the pharmaceutical industry [15] , has become a major target of business diversification from pharmaceutical companies. Interestingly, at this time, the number of acquisitions in the healthcare industry (131 cases), including medical devices, was the second highest after acquisitions of the homogeneous sector (449 cases) followed by distribution/logistics (57 cases) and the information and communication sector (30 cases) [16] . Pharmaceutical companies are highly interested in diversifying the medical device business because both medical device and drug are used by patients or doctors as end users for clinical purpose, and the distribution environment of products looks the same. The phenomenon by which multinational medical device companies are gradually developing and launching medical devices that contain medicines can also be attributed to the fact that the business environment is similar [17] . For these reasons, many pharmaceutical companies are expecting to raise overall corporate performance by improving their productivity through the business diversification of medical devices because of the productivity crisis.",

In the traditional pharmaceutical business, when a product is released through a large R&D investment, it continuously generates high profits with improving the supply of raw materials and promoting sales within the protection of patent rights [24] . When compared to pharmaceuticals, the medical device business has a short product life cycle and risk about easy product duplication, so the market competition is overheated due to the low entry barrier and product profits are not very high. Due to these differences, when a pharmaceutical company diversifies its medical device business, the total sales of the company might increase, but the overall performance of the company might decrease. Furthermore, considering additional costs and time, such as new production line, labor, preparation for medical device regulations, and expenses from sales and management, manufacturers should be aware that pharmaceutical and medical device businesses differ not only in their product development and life cycles, but also in the nature of the business and legal factors [25] .",

According to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS), the Korean pharmaceutical market in 2019 increased by 5.2% from 2018 (21.24 billion USD) to 22.33 billion USD, ranking 12th in the world (1.6%). Although the Korean pharmaceutical market is growing at a high level as a mature market, overall pharmaceutical companies are facing a decline in corporate performance and a productivity crisis due to the cost of new drug development, patent expiration, regulation, and competition. The phenomenon is common among pharmaceutical companies around the world. For this reason, many pharmaceutical companies in South Korea are expecting to improve corporate performance through diversification of medical device business. South Korea became a country where the trend and phenomenon of pharmaceutical companies that are representatively diversifying medical device business is gradually expanded to overcome the decline in corporate performance and a productivity crisis. For this purpose, this study measured the performance of companies using technical efficiency (TE) indicators. Where sales or productivity is affected by the company size, technical efficiency has the advantage of not being affected by the firm size because it estimates the firm's production function first and measures technical efficiency according to the distance from the production function. Recently Chung et al. [26] , Jo et al. [27] , Na et al. [28] , and many others measured firm performance using technical efficiency in accordance. Because conventional TE has the disadvantage of not being available for comparison between companies using different production functions, we compared pharmaceutical companies that have expanded their business to medical devices with traditional pharmaceutical companies in terms of a firm's TE.",

Specifically, the number of externally audited Korean pharmaceutical companies that acquire approval to manufacture and import medical devices for general treatment and surgery from the MFDS has increased rapidly since 2008. Because of a novel influenza outbreak in 2009, Korean pharmaceutical companies expanded to new businesses that manufacture, import, and distribute various types of medical devices, from advanced medical devices to diagnostic test kits and instrument.

This higher MTR of the diversified group means that the group's frontier production function is located closer to the meta-frontier production function. The frontier production function is determined by the technology used by the companies in the group and is the set of maximum outputs that the companies can produce. Therefore, the fact that the MTR of the pharmaceutical group that diversified into the medical device business is higher than the MTR of the traditional pharmaceutical group means that the maximum output that can be produced through the same input is higher, that is, it has a higher potential. Interestingly, in the MFA, which is the same production function, both TE* calculated with LP and QP showed higher results than traditional pharmaceutical companies diversifying their medical device business. As described above, TE* can be calculated as the multiplication of TE and MTR. In traditional pharmaceutical companies, although the MTR was lower than that of the pharmaceutical company group that diversified into the medical device business, the TE was much higher than that of the group. Thus, the TE* was higher. This means that traditional pharmaceutical companies are exhibiting higher efficiency under the current production function, but their potential is lower than that of pharmaceutical companies that have diversified into the medical device business.",

To date, preliminary results are in for three candidate vaccines and priority groups for vaccination have been identified. The provisional priority list in the UK focuses on care home residents and their carers, front-line health and social care workers, and older adults. 2 The high priority for health workers and care workers is due to the established elevated risk in these groups for infection, development of severe infection and spreading infection.

[13] [14] [15] Further, shift work is associated with alterations in the immune system and an increased risk for viral infections. 16 In this view, it is not surprising that recent evidence suggests that shift work is associated with an elevated risk of severe COVID-19, 5, 17 and that health care workers on night shifts have a higher risk of in-hospital SARS-CoV-2 infection than those on day shifts. 18 However, it is not known whether working shifts interacts with health worker status or ethnicity, both of which are independently associated with an elevated risk. 6, 19, 20 Shift workers are more likely to have disturbed sleep and variable sleep patterns 21 leading to disruption of the circadian rhythm. This has been hypothesised to increase the risk of COVID-19 in night shift workers, 22 but is evident even if the shift pattern does not include night work, likely due to sleep disruption in relation to circadian rhythms, 21 and may persist in the years following cessation of shift work. 23 Recent data have suggested that sleep disruption and high variability in sleep timing are associated with the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 and development of severe infection. 15 Exacerbating this, shift work is common in health workers where exposure to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and risk of developing severe COVID-19 is already relatively high. 6,7 Therefore, we hypothesise both health workers and shift workers will independently be at an increased risk of severe COVID-19, but this risk will be increased in health workers who are also shift workers. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

While we controlled for a range of available co-variates, including age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, co-morbidities and self-reported sleep (sensitivity analysis), other residual confounders may be present that predispose the shift workers to greater risk. However, Maidstone et al. 17 recently showed that the incidence of COVID-19 in shift workers was still greater when compared to non-shift workers in the same job. Further, in a previous UK Biobank study, we showed that objectively measured sleep disruption and variability in sleep timing was associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. 15 While disturbed sleep is prevalent in shift workers, 21 the risk was similar when excluding shift workers from the cohort. 15 This observation would suggest that sleep is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

The impact of health and shift work tended to be higher in minority ethnic groups, who are already at increased risk of severe COVID-19. The UK Reach study (https://uk-reach.org/main/) will investigate how, and why, ethnicity affects COVID=19 outcomes in healthcare workers. Notably, the risk associated with health workers was no longer apparent in people over retirement age, suggesting that the risk is likely explained by the exposure to the virus inherent to the occupation. However, in shift workers, an elevated albeit attenuated risk was still evident in people over retirement age, suggesting that the elevated risk associated with shift work may not be fully explained by increased exposure to the virus.

The estimated risk was greatest for individuals who were both a shift and health worker (aOR: 7\u00b756 [3\u00b786, 14\u00b779]). A similar pattern was found when the analysis was stratified by sex (Figure 1a), with a higher estimated association for both shift and health worker status in men (aOR: 10\u00b770 [4\u00b792, 23\u00b728]) than women (aOR: 3\u00b758 [0\u00b788, 14\u00b754]).

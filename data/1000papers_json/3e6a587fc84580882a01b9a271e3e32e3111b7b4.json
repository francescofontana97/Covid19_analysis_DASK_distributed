Therefore, the CDC recommends routine immunizations for children and adolescent populations against vaccinepreventable diseases e.g., tetanus, pertussis, diphtheria, etc. This current review sought to examine barriers to pediatric vaccine uptake behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explored the implications for parental vaccine hesitancy/delay during an ongoing health crisis and proposed recommendations for increasing vaccine confidence and compliance. Our review determined that the receipt for vaccinations steadily improved in the last decade for both the United States and Tennessee. However, this incremental progress has been forestalled by the COVID-19 pandemic and other barriers i.e. parental vaccine hesitancy, social determinants of health (SDoH) inequalities, etc. which further exacerbate vaccination disparities. Moreover, non-compliance to routine vaccinations could cause an outbreak of diseases, thereby, worsening the ongoing health crisis and already strained health care system. Healthcare providers are uniquely positioned to offer effective recommendations with presumptive languaging to increase vaccination rates, as well as, address parental vaccine hesitancy. Best practices that incorporate healthcare providers' quality improvement coaching, vaccination reminder recall systems, adherence to standardized safety protocols (physical distancing, hand hygiene practices, etc.), as well as, offer telehealth and outdoor/drivethrough/curbside vaccination services, etc. are warranted. Additionally, a concerted effort should be made to utilize public health surveillance systems to collect, analyze, and interpret data, thereby, ensuring the dissemination of timely, accurate health information for effective health policy decision-making e.g., vaccine distribution, etc.",

In the pre-vaccine era and before the 1963 measles vaccination programs, there were roughly 6,000 deaths attributed to the measles virus each year (2) . Moreover, between 1964 and 1965, an epidemic of the rubella virus resulted in an estimated 2,000 neonatal deaths and 11,000 fetal miscarriages (3) . Accordingly, it has been projected that over 100 million cases of vaccine-preventable illnesses i.e. measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, etc., have been prevented in the U.S. (4) . Between 1994 and 2013, an enormous financial burden to the tune of approximately $402 billion and $1.5 trillion was prevented in direct and societal costs (5) . Concurrently, within Tennessee, a racially and economically diverse state ranking 16 th most populous in the U.S, vaccine-preventable diseases have significantly decreased. This is due to widespread institutional policies to increase vaccine uptake (to meet Tennessee Immunization Program (TIP)'s 90% goal), as well as, wider acceptance of healthcare providers' recommendations (6) . Overall, vaccinations continue to serve an essential role in protecting vulnerable individuals from potentially deadly vaccine-preventable illnesses.",

The COVID-19 presents with a continuum of respiratory tract symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, pneumonia, influenzalike illness, etc., and is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) (8, 9) . In the U.S., the COVID-19 has resulted in 28,405,925 incident cases and 511,839 mortalities. Whereas, in Tennessee, 2.7% of total U.S. cases (775,693) and 2.2% of total U.S. deaths (11, 421) have been recorded (10) . Following mutations in their virus genome, new variants of the SARS-COV-2 have begun to emerge with alterations to their features. Concerningly, these genetic variants may increase disease severity and infectivity as well as change treatment and vaccine efficacy (11) . Consequently, this ongoing public health crisis from COVID-19 has had devastating impacts on every aspect of human life causing significant morbidity and mortality, adverse psychological outcomes, and growing socioeconomic losses. Additionally, the pandemic has disrupted the hard-earned progress made in the last decade to improve vaccination rates. This current review sought to explore the barriers to pediatric vaccine uptake behaviors (e.g., vaccine hesitancy), as well as, propose recommendations for increasing vaccine confidence and compliance to immunization schedules within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) recommends routine immunizations against diseases e.g., measles, whooping cough for children ages through 2 years. For the 78.6 million children born between 1994 and 2013 in the U.S., routine childhood vaccinations have prevented an estimated 322 million illnesses, 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 untimely deaths from measles (70,748), varicella (68,445), pertussis (54, 406) , mumps (42,704), and rubella (36, 540) (10) . Consequently, within the last decade i.e. 2009-2017, coverage for the combined 7-vaccine series 1 among children ages 19-35 months has risen comparably in the U.S. and Tennessee from 44.3% to 72.2% and 44.8% to 79.3%, respectively (12) (Figure 1) .",

Although, while the prevalence for all specified vaccines varied slightly within a 10%-point range in 2008, HPV vaccination rates have continued to significantly lag behind that of Tdap and meningococcal conjugate vaccines in recent years. While national vaccination rates for Tdap and meningococcal conjugate vaccines have reached or exceeded the HealthyPeople 2030 set-goal of 80% for vaccine coverage among adolescents (13 to 17 years), immunization with the HPV vaccine remains considerably low. See Figure 2 . Despite current ACIP protocols and improving trends for other vaccines, the 2019 coverage for \u22651 HPV vaccine among male and female adolescents was estimated at 71.5% in the US and 9.6 percentage points lower (61.9%) in Tennessee (13) .",

These precautionary measures, which have disrupted healthcare systems and health personnel services, have ultimately led to sub-optimal vaccine delivery services and vaccination rates (14) . In the U.S., after the national emergency declaration, the aggregate count for pediatric vaccine doses procured by the Vaccine-for-Children (VFC) providers substantially declined (15) . Similarly, the WHO recorded a 28-year reduction in global coverage for the Tdap 1 \u2265 4 doses of diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and pertussis, \u2265 3 doses of polio, \u2265 1 measles-containing vaccine, Haemophilus influenza type b full series, \u2265 3 hepatitis b, \u2265 1 varicella and \u2265 4 pneumococcal vaccine. vaccine (16) . Also, notable was the collective shift in focus on routine vaccinations to respond urgently to the ongoing health crisis (17) . These events have been exacerbated by the adverse rippling effects of other COVID-19 pandemic sequelae which include overwhelmed healthcare systems; inequalities in healthcare delivery; financial recession and job losses; worries about vaccine costs; inadequate personal protective equipment for healthcare workers; severe shortages in testing modalities and treatment therapies; long-term school closures; contradictory messages from health agencies/authorities; as well as; disruptions to transportation and travel restrictions. Additionally, parental concerns regarding exposure to the COVID-19 have discouraged individuals who would otherwise have utilized vaccination services, thus, resulting in postponed/ canceled medical appointment visits. Moreover, restrictions on routine in-person office visits due to physical distancing protocols have limited health care providers' communications promoting vaccine uptake to patients (18) . Overall, the existing COVID-19 pandemic has forestalled the painstaking but incremental progress made in the last decade to improve uptake for HPV and other vaccines. Disruptions to vaccine delivery services have negatively impacted timely immunizations leaving children/adolescents susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases. As the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director Henrietta Fore aptly describes it, \"COVID-19 has made previously routine vaccination a daunting challenge\u2026\" (16) . An outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic would only worsen the already strained health care system due to rising hospitalization and death rates.",

Additionally, parental education; household living conditions and income; healthcare access; philosophical and cultural beliefs; religious affiliations; and urban Vs. rural residence, are some of the SDoH that influence childhood vaccination rates (22) . In recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of incorporating SDoH into health systems and health service delivery.

This phenomenon also incorporates the antivaccine movement as well as parents' adoption of alternate, nonstandardized vaccination schedules. Parent's hesitancy, refusals, and delays in adhering to routine childhood immunizations are largely responsible for a significant number of unvaccinated/ under-vaccinated children, disease outbreaks, co-morbidities (e.g., meningitis, pneumonia, HPV-related cancers), as well as, untimely deaths. Vaccine hesitancy and refusal have mostly occurred due to state/local policies that have allowed parents to decline routine childhood vaccinations based on non-medical exemptions (24) . These non-medical exemptions occur in the form of religious exemptions e.g., due to an individual's religious beliefs which oppose the use of fetal tissue for vaccines and personal belief exemptions e.g., due to an individual's logical reasoning which disapproves the use of non-natural products for vaccines (24) . Prevalence estimates for vaccination exemptions are currently 2.5% and 1.9% nationally and in Tennessee, respectively (25) . Currently, in the U.S., 45 states and Washington D.C. permit religious exemptions while 15 states allow philosophical exemptions from childhood vaccinations.",

Following larger multiple studies and a wealth of scientific evidence, this hypothesized link was disproved and the safety of the MMR vaccine reinforced (29, 30) .

Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine non-compliance/refusal, the pediatrician and other healthcare providers are uniquely qualified to promote vaccinations achieved through the use of strong, presumptive languaging (44) to offer effective, consistent recommendations that emphasize disease/cancer prevention. The healthcare professionals' reluctance to share recommendations that facilitate vaccine uptake could result in parental hesitancy, refusal, and delay. In 2019, national HPV coverage among adolescents with a provider's recommendation (74.7% CI:73.3-76.0) was almost twice as those without one (46.7% CI:43.8-49.6) (21) . Concurrently, in Tennessee, coverage was 72.4% (CI:64.3-79.2) for those who received advice from their providers as opposed to those without (28.2% CI:16.6-43.6) (21) . This supports the notion that recommendations offered by health providers could significantly predict vaccine uptake, thereby reinforcing the need for personalized patient-provider interactions.",

Specifically, quality improvement coaching such as the CDC's Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange (AFIX) program which facilitates provider's education and feedback through face-to-face coaching has been shown to improve immunization rates (45) . Also, campaigns should aim to increase providers' self-efficacy and confidence to address parental concerns on vaccine's efficacy, side effect(s), lack of health insurance as well as adopt the use of electronic medical records (EMRs), immunization information systems, and medical practice alerts to remind parents about scheduled regular in-patient visits (46) . Parents without health insurance should receive information on reduced out-of-pocket costs and publicly-funded vaccines available through the VFC program (13) . For parents with religious or philosophical beliefs, healthcare provider's information on the fewer components of proteins and polysaccharides in vaccines could serve to allay fears (38) . For others, communication on societal norms that promote routine vaccination as a social responsibility could increase vaccine uptake (47) . Moreover, addressing parental concerns for needle pain, skin reactions, and sensitivity as well as the adoption of motivational interview techniques (i.e. acceptance, compassion, collaboration, etc.) could be impactful (38) .",

Wellness-child visits through telemedicine video conferencing; administering of vaccines through outdoor/curbside/ drive-through services; vaccine delivery in alternative settings e.g., pharmacies, schools; minimizing on-site patient visit at any single point in time; delineating specific, well-ventilated rooms for wellness visits, vaccine-only visits, etc., should be implemented to tackle the current COVID-19 health crisis (14) . Overall, clinicians should work in synergy with other healthcare team members to maximize scheduled wellness/immunization visits, and other routine medical checkups particularly in places with a low prevalence of health provider's recommendations e.g., rural areas. While mandatory vaccination policies have been shown to be associated with higher vaccine acceptance rates (49) , these should be reinforced with patient-provider interactions that address parental concerns. Additionally, nonmedical exemption laws should be reviewed to ensure that in places where they have not been prohibited, there should be in place effective administrative controls so that exemptions do not become easier defaults when compared to vaccinations (50, 51) . Government health officials, as well as, the school districts should continue to enforce and maintain up-to-date immunization records. The catch-up vaccination protocols issued by the CDC to facilitate coverage for children with missed appointments during the pandemic should be implemented (52) . Education campaigns should also be tailored to engage local and religious leaders, be culturally appropriate and address specific concerns from vaccine-hesitant populations.",

Accordingly, the application of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (53) would be beneficial to (a) identify trends, patterns, and prevalence of childhood vaccine uptake and vaccine-preventable illnesses; (b) investigate psychosocial factors and disparities influencing the receipt of vaccines; as well as (c) examine the interface between vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks and vaccine hesitancy/ refusal. Specifically, more concerted efforts should be made to implement Personal Health Libraries (54) along with Public Health Observatories (55) for vaccine acceptance surveillance (56) on a national scale and within the state of Tennessee. These intelligent tools can facilitate precision health promotion to increase vaccination rates (57) as well as examine causal associations between predictors (e.g., SDoH, COVID-19 pandemic policies, etc.) and outcomes (e.g., vaccine uptake, vaccine hesitancy). In addition to facilitating linkages between healthcare systems, these applications could ensure timely access to accurate health information crucial for effective decisionmaking regarding vaccine access, allocation services, etc. Health policy-driven changes that address vaccine hesitancy, SDoH inequalities, and disparities in vaccination access would be advantageous. Finally, more research that qualitatively examines barriers to vaccine uptake behaviors, as well as drivers to vaccine hesitancy among specific populations, would be beneficial.",

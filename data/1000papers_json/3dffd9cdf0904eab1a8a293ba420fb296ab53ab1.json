In the United Kingdom (UK), the pandemic significantly disrupted oncology services as resources were reassigned to care for COVID-19 patients. In addition to service disruptions, many women received a UK Government letter advising them to shield for 12-weeks. We aimed to explore the effect of disruption to scheduled oncology services and the UK Government shielding letter on emotional and cognitive vulnerability. A further aim was to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 related emotional vulnerability (COVID-EMV) and anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. Women diagnosed with primary breast cancer (N = 234) completed a series of online questionnaires to assess their cognitive and emotional wellbeing as well as their COVID-EMV. Results indicated that disrupted oncology services had a significant impact on COVID-EMV, anxiety and depression, with those experiencing disruptions expressing higher general emotional vulnerability as well as COVID-EMV. Further, the UK Government letter had a significant effect on perceived cognitive function; those who received the letter reported poorer cognitive function. Regression analyses revealed that after allowing for the effects of sociodemographic and clinical variables, women's COVID-EMV significantly predicted worse outcomes of anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. Our findings indicate that concerns about COVID-19 amongst women affected by breast cancer leads to increased risk of developing affective disorder, such as anxiety and depression symptomatology, among this sample. We advocate the rapid implementation of accessible interventions designed to promote emotional resilience in the breast cancer population.",

Whilst this has caused unprecedented disruption to populations globally, it is a particularly worrying time for vulnerable groups with pre-existing health conditions, including women with a breast cancer diagnosis. The immunosuppressant effects of cancer and its treatment (Verma et al., 2016) , coupled with the multimorbidity that often occurs in cancer patients (Renzi et al., 2019) , suggests that those affected by breast cancer and other cancers may be at particular risk from the impact of COVID-19 (Zhang et al., 2020) . Indeed, in the UK, recent estimates predict approximately 18,000 excess cancer deaths over the next 12 months as a result of the COVID-19 emergency (Lai et al., 2020) .",

Observations indicate that at the height of the emergency, across eight hospitals in the UK, a majority of patients with cancer or suspected cancer were not accessing healthcare services, with major declines in chemotherapy attendances (60% reduction) and urgent referrals for early diagnosis (76% reduction) (Lai et al., 2020) . Early diagnosis and intervention are critical factors for survival outcomes in breast cancer. Recent data indicates that 100% of women diagnosed at Stage 1 survive their disease for at least one year, compared to 66% diagnosed at Stage 4 (Office for National Statistics, 2019). However, in the midst of a global pandemic, it is understandable that individuals with ambiguous symptoms, which may or may not reflect cancer disease, are reluctant to seek help.",

Once active treatment is complete, many breast cancer survivors are still expected to attend routine checkups, have regular scans, or yearly mammograms, many of which have been disrupted as a consequence of COVID-19. For those with estrogen-positive breast cancer, treatment can extend to 10 years post-diagnosis, with the administration of endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, to reduce the risk of recurrence. As such, continued access to healthcare services is important to women in the breast cancer survivorship period.",

Whilst studies indicate that emotional distress is at its most severe during diagnosis and active treatment (Schubart et al., 2014) , clinically important distress can persist in survivorship (Carreira et al., 2018) . Long term sequela including fatigue, sleep disturbance, joint pain and hot flushes, as well as sexual dysfunction, can profoundly affect quality of life (Fallowfield and Jenkins, 2015) . For younger women, further stress may derive from the potential onset of early menopause and loss of fertility caused by estrogen depleting endocrine therapies (Gorman et al., 2010) . Negative thinking patterns are also common including ruminative healthrelated thinking styles and concerns related to the fear of cancer recurrence and one's own mortality (Steiner et al., 2014; Thewes et al., 2016) . Neurocognitive dysfunction is a further common problem among the breast cancer population (see Andryszak et al., 2017; Ahles and Root, 2018 for reviews) and may be associated with adverse mental health outcomes (Chapman et al., 2019) . Accordingly, the breast cancer population are at high-risk for developing clinical levels of emotional distress, which can result in affective disorders such as anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Steiner et al., 2014; Voigt et al., 2017; Tsaras et al., 2018) .",

Along with treatment disruptions, many women living in the UK affected by breast cancer will have received a UK Government letter categorizing them as vulnerable and outlining a 12-week social restriction and shielding plan (Gov.UK, 2020) . Recipients of the letter may include those undergoing chemotherapy, immunotherapy or having other targeted cancer treatments that can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors. Others may have received a letter at the discretion of their general practitioner (GP). Such guidelines are also likely to increase social isolation and loneliness (Holmes et al., 2020) , which are independently associated with anxiety, depression, and self-harm (Elovainio et al., 2017) . It is currently unclear how long vulnerable populations will be affected by the impact of the COVID-19 crisis; however, the ramifications may be severe. It follows that understanding the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on cognitive and emotional health is critical to supporting the breast cancer population moving forward.",

First, we decided to investigate the effect of disruption to scheduled oncology services (i.e., delayed treatment or canceled scans) and the UK Government shielding letter on emotional vulnerability and perceived cognitive function in a group of women affected by primary breast cancer. We then decided to examine the relationship between COVID-19 related emotional vulnerability (COVID-EMV) and general anxiety, general depression and perceived cognitive function whilst controlling for rumination, worry, and key clinical and sociodemographic variables. Worry, which is characterized by uncontrollable affectively negative thoughts about the future (Borkovec et al., 1983) , and rumination, distinguished by repetitive affectively negative thoughts (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008) , are core cognitive components of clinical anxiety and depression respectively (Beckw\u00e9 et al., 2014) . As such, trait ruminative and worrisome thinking styles are key predictors for emotional disorder (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000; see Koster et al., 2017 for a review) . Indeed the bidirectional relationship between cognition and emotion is well established (Pessoa, 2008) , with cognitive health playing an important role in emotional regulation and vice versa (Dolcos et al., 2019) . With this in mind, we felt that it was important to allow for the predictive value of worry and rumination whilst assessing the impact of COVID-EMV on anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. The additive stress caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, which may compound worrisome and ruminative thinking patterns, may predict worse outcomes for anxiety, depression and cognitive health in women affected by breast cancer, who already consistently indicate cognitive and emotional vulnerability. Accordingly, we predicted that compared to those unaffected, women who experienced changes to their scheduled oncology services or appointments (i.e., telephone appointments in place of face-to-face) or who received the UK Government shielding letter would express higher levels of general emotional vulnerability (i.e., anxiety and depression) and COVID-EMV as well as a worse perceived cognitive function. In addition, we predicted that worry and rumination would respectively predict anxiety and depression as well as perceived cognitive function. Finally, we predicted that after controlling for worry, rumination and key clinical and sociodemographic variables, COVID-EMV would significantly predict worse outcomes for general anxiety, general depression and perceived cognitive function.",

The Fact-Cog also assesses the impact of these cognitive changes on quality of life and the comments that have been made by others (i.e., \"other people have told me I seemed confused\"). Questions are measured on five-point Likert scale ranging from not at all or never (0) to several times a day or very much (5), with a total score ranging from 0 to 148.

The breast cancer population are at high-risk for developing clinical levels of emotional disorder due to the distressing nature of diagnosis, treatment and long-term side effects (Carreira et al., 2018) . The COVID-19 crisis has not only disrupted oncology services but has further required extremely vulnerable groups to follow social shielding guidance for their protection. It follows that such changes may prompt further distress in this population and as such, it is imperative that the effects of COVID-19 related stress are examined. Findings firstly indicate that those who experienced disruptions to their oncology services had higher levels of general anxiety, depression and COVID-19 related emotional vulnerability. Further, results show that those who received a UK Government shielding letter had worse perceived cognitive functioning. This suggests that the indirect consequences of COVID-19 (i.e., oncology service disruption and behavior change requirements) has resulted in worse cognitive and emotional health outcomes in the breast cancer population.",

Both rumination and worry are defined by their intrusive and persistent nature and as such have been identified as key cognitive predictors of affective disorder (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000) . Similarly, they have further been associated with deficits in cognitive efficiency (Beckw\u00e9 et al., 2014; see Koster et al., 2017 for a review) . Supporting this, we found that rumination was a significant predictor of worse perceived cognitive function. Of further pertinence, findings indicate that comorbidity with other health conditions significantly predicted higher levels of depression and worse cognitive functioning. This corroborates current reviews that point to the detrimental effects of multimorbidity on psychological health, with studies indicating that depression is two to three times more likely in individuals with multiple health conditions (Read et al., 2017) . Finally, of critical importance, after controlling for the predictive value of all demographic variables, multimorbidity as well as worry and rumination, findings demonstrated that COVID-19 related emotional distress was a significant predictor for worse outcomes of anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. This suggests that the restrictions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized pre-existing levels of cognitive and emotional vulnerability in women affected by primary breast cancer. Pertinently, our analyses controled for potential confounding effects of clinical variables including active treatment status, grade of breast cancer, age of diagnosis, and time since diagnosis. This therefore suggests that findings are applicable to women affected by breast cancer at varying disease and treatment stages, and not only those with more severe cancer-specific vulnerabilities. In the same way, our analyses controlled for the influential effects of trait worry and rumination, which in line with current research, we would typically expect to predict anxiety and depression. Findings indicate that once the predictive value of worry and rumination have been accounted for, COVID-19 related distress was still predictive of generalized anxiety and depression. This suggests that the emotional stress experienced by women affected by breast cancer is over and above preexisting levels as a result of the restrictions relating to COVID-19.",

Moreover, emotional distress in women affected by breast cancer has been associated with reduced treatment compliance (Greer et al., 2008) , which may influence disease progression and mortality (Satin et al., 2009) . Accordingly, any additional distress brought about the COVID-19 pandemic is a noteworthy concern for this population. Furthermore, cancer-related cognitive impairment is a common component of the breast cancer experience (Ahles and Root, 2018) , which can greatly impact quality of life. As such, elevated levels of cognitive inefficiency may have considerable consequences for everyday functioning in this population. That said, the above findings must be interpreted with caution. Whilst results show COVID-EMV predicts worse levels of anxiety, depression and cognitive functioning, the relationship may be bidirectional. That is, worse anxiety, depression and cognitive functioning may also predict greater levels of COVID-EMV. Similarly, there may still be a third variable not controlled for in the current analyses, which may have influenced our outcomes.",

Cancer patients can experience longer term immunosuppressant effects of cancer and its treatment (Kang et al., 2009; Verma et al., 2016) , and are further likely to experience multimorbidity with other health conditions (Renzi et al., 2019) . As such, the additional indirect effects of treatment delays and disruptions may lead to a significant increase in the psychological burden associated with breast cancer. Further longitudinal research is now required to assess the extent of continued distress associated with COVID-19 disruptions. We advocate that future government preparedness plans consider the mental health implications of pandemics for this population. As such, appropriate eHealth interventions that can be delivered remotely should be further developed and implemented (Penedo et al., 2020) . Capitalizing on recent research promoting the effectiveness of online interventions for anxiety and depression in breast cancer may facilitate this aim (Swainston and Derakshan, 2018) . As the pandemic progresses, the mental health effects of COVID-19 may be further amplified by longer term effects such as economic recession and continued isolation for vulnerable groups (Gunnell et al., 2020; Holmes et al., 2020) . We therefore recommend the continued scientific investigation of COVID-19 related distress in the breast cancer population to identify long-term cognitive and emotional outcomes.",

As a consequence of shielding and social distancing, participants were recruited via social media platforms and therefore may not be fully representative of the breast cancer population at large. Similarly, our sample lacked diversity; the majority of our participants were caucasian and well-educated. This means that other breast cancer groups, such as those from BAME populations, may be underrepresented in the current study. Emerging data suggests that BAME populations are at increased risk of acquiring the SARS-Cov-2 infection compared to white individuals, and additionally suffer worse clinical outcomes (Pan et al., 2020) . As such, we can speculate that increased psychological burden may be even further emphasized in BAME populations. In addition, the UK Government letter categorizing women as vulnerable was sometimes issued at the discretion of the participant's GP. This means that this group may have had varying degrees of vulnerability. Finally, due to the cross-sectional design of our study, we were unable to measure levels of cognitive and emotional vulnerability pre-pandemic, and as such cannot measure to what extent emotional vulnerability has increased.",

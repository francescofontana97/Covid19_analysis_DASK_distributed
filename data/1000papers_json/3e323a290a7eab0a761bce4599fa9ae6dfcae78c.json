In order to address restricted treatment access during COVID-19, guidance from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, and the US Department of Health and Human Services has allowed for use of audio-only telehealth encounters for buprenorphine induction without requiring an in-person evaluation or video interface. This has enabled innovations in order to try to meet the needs of the most vulnerable among us during the current pandemic. In this new regulatory environment, we established the Rhode Island Buprenorphine Hotline, a phone hotline which functions as a \"tele-bridge\" clinic where people with moderate to severe opioid use disorder can be linked with a DATA 2000 waivered provider who can provide an initial assessment and, if appropriate, prescribe buprenorphine for unobserved induction and linkage to outpatient treatment. In this correspondence we briefly share our experience developing this common sense approach to addressing the complex problem of access to treatment only now permissible due to regulatory changes during COVID-19.",

Policy makers and regulatory bodies have similarly been forced to adapt to prevent catastrophic disruptions in access to buprenorphine and methadone. To minimize barriers to care and prevent increases in overdose deaths during the COVID-19 emergency, the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, and the US Department of Health and Human Services issued guidances that allow for use of audioonly telehealth encounters for buprenorphine induction without requiring an in-person evaluation or video interface. 2 Loosening regulations in this way provides a unique opportunity to provide and evaluate low-threshold buprenorphine prescribing models. These new models of care delivery challenge some of the current non-evidence based regulations and requirements that limit engagement and access to care.

Evaluation will determine hotline effectiveness and acceptability, but thus far, overall reception has been positive. Hotline respondents have expressed difficulties otherwise accessing treatment and significant anxieties about leaving their homes.

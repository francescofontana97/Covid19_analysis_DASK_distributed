Knowledge about the natural history of this disease, its pathophysiology and treatment is unfolding day by day but mystery remains as to how this pandemic will eventually fade out.

Fatality rates are higher in elderly population, patients with various co morbidities like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung, renal disease and malignancy [3] .",

There is decrease in the peripheral counts of CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells with a concomitant increase in highly proinflammatory Th17 CD4 \u00fe T cells and various cytokines. Acute phase reactants like serum ferritin, ESR, CRP, IL-6 are much higher in diabetics with Covid-19 infection as compared to patients without diabetes. The \"stress response\" to infection in the body worsens hyperglycaemia by antagonising the insulin action or by inhibiting insulin secretion by the beta cells [12] . Such observations support the proposition that the patients with diabetes are susceptible to enhanced inflammatory response, which could lead to rapid deterioration of COVID-19 infection with high mortality [13] .",

Upon activation of VDR by pathogens, there is activation of several downstream antimicrobial factors like cathelicidin, CD 14, nucleotide oligomerization domain protein 2 (NOD 2) and many other signalling molecules [15] . VDR is also present in T lymphocytes where it acts as inhibitor of T lymphocyte activation. Vitamin D suppresses T cell mediated inflammation and enhances the effects of anti-inflammatory Treg cells [16] . Hence 1,25(OH) 2 D has a stimulatory effect on the native immune system (comprising mainly of monocytes/macrophages), whereas it has down regulatory effect on adaptive immune system (comprising mainly dependent of T-helper cells) [16] .

Such study cannot be undertaken for technical reasons in the prevailing scenario. Considering the range of beneficial immune effects ascribed to vitamin D, its proven safety and ease of administration, vitamin D supplementation as an adjuvant therapeutic intervention in COVID-19 critically ill patients could be of paramount clinical and economic significance.",

Through paracrine and intracrine action, it regulates dendritic cells and inhibits proliferation of T helper cells (Th1), skewing cytokine production towards T helper 2 (Th2) cells. It has endocrine action on activation of antigen presenting cells like monocytes and on mobility of neutrophils contributing more to its antibacterial activity.",

Governments have resorted to draconian measures to contain the spread of the disease despite its devastating effect on their economies and education. Tracking the novel coronavirus 2019 disease remains vital as it influences the executive decisions needed to tighten or ease restrictions meant to curb the pandemic. One-Dimensional (1D) Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) have been used classify and predict several time-series and sequence data. Here 1D-CNN is applied to the time-series data of confirmed COVID-19 cases for all reporting countries and territories. The model performance was 90.5% accurate. The model was used to develop an automated AI tracker web app (AI Country Monitor) and is hosted on https://aicountrymonitor.org. This article also presents a novel concept of pandemic response curves based on cumulative confirmed cases that can be use to classify the stage of a country or reporting territory. It is our firm believe that this Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 tracker can be extended to other domains such as the monitoring/tracking of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in addition to monitoring and tracking pandemics.",

We also note that no studies or existing dashboards/trackers employ the use of artificial intelligence to predict the state of COVID-19 for reporting countries and territories. The method proposed in this study involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and predictions using one dimensional deep convolution neural networks. Even though other algorithms exist that can be used in performing feature extraction and classification of sequence or time-series data, convolution neural networks have been found to be superior [13] [14] [15] [16] in extracting unique features and patterns in sequences [17] [18] [19] , images and video data. In fact, deep convolution neural networks algorithms are behind some of the state-of-the-art detection and tracking algorithms found in everyday images and videos. Here, 1D-CNN is used to extract unique feature identifiers that help predict the true state of countries and territories with respect to the novel coronavirus disease, uncovering hidden and underlying patterns that might otherwise not be readily noticed.",

Data Labeling: countries and reporting territories that have been found to have been reported in the media as having reached one of the 3 stages of COVID-19 were manually identified, verified (visually and using third-party websites like EndCoronavirus.org and tagged with one of the labels: Stage 1 -Cases actively rising; Stage 2 -Cases have passed peak and begun to actively decline; Stage 3 -Cases consistently zero or near zero after active declining. These stages were labeled as Stage 1: Emerging, Stage 2: Controlling, Stage 3: Winning.In the most recent version of the model update 134 countries were manually labelled for AI training and validation.

This was followed by another 1D-CNN also with 64 filters, kernel size of 3 x 3, padding, strides of 1, and ReLu activation unit. A GlobalMaxPooling1D layer was used to flatten the 1D-CNN and the output fed into a 256 Dense layer. A 20% Dropout layer was then added with ReLu activation unit and then fed to another 128 Dense layer then to the 3 classification output layers using the Sigmoid activation function. The model was compiled using the Adam as the optimizer(initial learning rate of 0.001), Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function, and Accuracy as the metrics. In addition, four callbacks were also setup and used with model during training. They were: ModelCheckpoint (saved the best models during training), EarlyStopping (terminateg training if no improvement is being made), ReduceLROnPlateau (adjusts the learning rate if optimizer appears stuck in a local minima), and Tensorboard (live monitoring of training progress). The model was then repeatedly trained over 2000 epochs and the best performing models selected for use in the AI Covid Tracker.",

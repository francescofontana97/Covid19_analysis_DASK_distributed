            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is an acute and highly contagious disease that is extremely harmful to the poultry industry throughout the world. The cross-using of different attenuated live vaccine strains has led to the occurrence of diverse IBV serotypes. In this study, we isolated an IBV strain from a chicken farm in southwest China and designated it CK/CH/ SCMY/160315. Construction of a phylogenetic tree based on full S1 gene sequence analysis suggested that CK/CH/SCMY/160315 bears similarity to GI-28, and further comparison of S1 amino acid residues revealed that CK/CH/SCMY/160315 showed mutations and deletions in many key positions between LDT3-A and other GI-28 reference strains. Importantly, CK/CH/ SCMY/160315 was identified as a novel recombinant virus derived from live attenuated vaccine strains H120 (GI-1), 4/91 (GI-13), LDT3-A (GI-28), and the field strain LJL/08-1 (GI-19), identifying at least 5 recombination sites in both structural and accessory genes. Pathogenicity analysis indicated that CK/CH/SCMY/ 160315 caused listlessness, sneezing, huddling, head shaking, and increased antibody levels in the inoculated chickens. To further describe pathogenicity of this novel strain, we assessed viral load in different tissues and conducted hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the trachea, lungs and kidneys. Our results provide evidence for the continuing evolution of IBV field strains via genetic recombination and mutation, leading to outbreaks in the vaccinated chicken populations in China.",

IBV poses a major global economic threat, causing a considerable reduction in the quality and quantity of layer chickens (Cavanagh, 2007; Laconi et al., 2020) . Infected chickens develop neurological and respiratory symptoms, including disheveled feathers, depression, and respiratory distress (Wu et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2019) . Furthermore, chickens infected with IBV also become susceptible to secondary infections with bacteria or other pathogens due to damage to tracheal cilia and therefore display a higher mortality rate (Zhou et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "IBV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 27.6 kb in length and thus is one of the largest known RNA viruses. Similar to the genomic RNA (gRNA) of other coronaviruses, two thirds of the IBV genome encode non-structural proteins, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other accessory and regulatory proteins, while the remaining third encodes 4 structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) protein . The S protein is critical for antigenic neutralization, hemagglutination, and determination of cell tropism. However, in the Golgi apparatus, spike (S)S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by a cellular proteases upon viral invasion, which remains non-covalently linked (de Haan et al., 2004; Yamada and Liu, 2009) . Nearly half of the amino acid of the S gene is occupied by the S1 domain, which contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is essential for viral adsorption to the cellular receptor and induction of neutralizing antibodies (Kant et al., 1992; Casais et al., 2003; Promkuntod et al., 2014) . In addition, hyper-variable regions (HVRs) of the S1 gene influence the antigenic relatedness and receptor binding with host cells, therefore most of studies have utilized the S1 subunit for IBV genotyping and classification (Valastro et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2018; Shan et al., 2018; Parsons et al., 2019) . The other half of S gene contains transmembrane and C-terminal cytoplasmic tail domains, which is occupied by the S2 domain (Luo and Weiss, 1998) . The ecto-domain region of the S2 subunit contains a fusion peptide and 2 heptad repeat regions involved in oligomerization of the S protein, which is required for entry into susceptible cells (Degroot et al., 1987; Tripet et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "The most effective way to prevent epidemic IBV is to vaccinate, typically using live attenuated vaccines derived from virulent strains serially passaged in embryonated chicken eggs (Laconi et al., 2020) . Commercial attenuated vaccines such as H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A are already frequently used on farms. However, due to the incomplete proofreading mechanisms of coronavirus RNA polymerases and genetic recombination during viral replication, evolution generates extensive genotypic, antigenic, and pathogenic variability in progeny viruses (Cavanagh, 1997; Li et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2019) . This frequent variation produces a number of IBV genotypes and serotypes with only limited cross-protective immunity between different serotypes, therefore failures in vaccination immunization are often reported. The QX-like type IBV is a member of the GI-19 group and represents one of the most important IBV genotypes globally, also representing the predominant type of IBV in China since 1999 ). Many reports have pointed out that the QX strain has participated in recombination with vaccine strains and has resulted in changes of the antigenic characteristics of the vaccine strain (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2012; Fellahi et al., 2015) . Previous studies have focused on the S1 gene due to its unique antigenicity (Madu et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2016) , but research in recent years has found that non-structural and helper viral proteins of IBV and other coronaviruses may play a regulatory role in viral replication, pathogenicity and immune escape (Armesto et al., 2009; Han et al., 2017) . These findings suggest investigation of the whole-genome characteristics of coronaviruses will be of great significance for understanding the relationship between these virus and their antigenicity, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity .",

Our analysis revealed that the genome of CK/CH/SCMY/160315 shares the highest identity with the CK/CH/SCYB/140913 strain (Xia et al., 2016) , and has 94.60%,92.25%, 90.82%, and 88.34% identity with the commercial vaccine H120 (GI-1), 4/91 (GI-13), LDT3-A (GI-28), and field strain LJL/ 08-1 (GI-19), respectively (Zhang et al., 2010; Han et al., 2016) . The ORFs, nucleotide similarity, amino-acid identity, and genomic regions present in IBV strains CK/CH/SCMY/160315 and the 4 reference strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .",

The highest similarity after the genetic comparison is highlighted in bold. reference strains showed that for all, the length was 1620 nucleotides, corresponding to a 540-amino acid S1 protein. As illustrated in Figure 2 , CK/CH/SCMY/160315 was missing 1 amino acid at positions 287 and 24, respectively, compared to GI-28. Meanwhile, of the 42 identified substitutions between CK/CH/SCMY/160315 and GI-28, 25 were located in the HVR (3, 4 and 18 are located in HVR1, HVR2, and HVR3, respectively), and the remaining 17 mutations were located in the far Cterminus of the S1 subunit of the S protein.

Comparing CK/CH/ SCMY/160315 with LDT3-A strains, only 3 mutations were observed, all of which were located in HVR2. Previous research has shown that the amino acid residue at position 69 of the S1 subunit is important for the RBD, and mutations will affect the ability to bind to tracheal cilia (Bouwman et al., 2020). We found that amino acid residue position 69 of the strain CK/ CH/SCMY/160315 was changed from I to V, suggesting a difference in antigenicity between the two strains. Moreover, we found CK/CH/SCMY/ 160315 two specific differences in the S1 amino acid sequence at positions 155 H and 121 Q which were not found in any other IBV strains.",

Although the S2 protein has been considered to be relatively conserved in previous studies (Adzhar et al., 1997) , we found that the S2 protein still has the possibility of recombination, which is consistent with results by Abro et al. (Abro et al., 2012) and others. The genomic position from nt16, 351-22,884 and nt23,811-24,175 were most similar to LDT3-A.

Flocks had suffered from clinical symptoms of listlessness, sneezing, dyspnea, and respiratory distress. We assessed the whole genome characteristics of this novel strain. Phylogenetic analyses of the S1 gene revealed that CK/CH/SCMY/160315 grouped along the GI-28, a pathogenic kidney IBV which is prevalent in southwest China. Meanwhile, located in the same group was the LDT3-A strain, a commonly used vaccine strain in China. In addition, we compared CK/ CH/SCMY/160315 and LDT3-A and found that their S1 sequence similarity was as high as 99.8% (data not shown), while the full-length sequence similarity was only 90.82% (Table 1) .

Compared with other GI-28 reference strains, nearly half of the differences of CK/CH/SCMY/160315 were located in the HVR3 region, all of which were shown on HVR2 compared with the case of the most similar strain LDT3-A. It implied that HVR3 on the S1 gene may play an important role in the genetic evolution of different IBVs.",

            "text": "Similarly, to other RNA viruses, IBV continues undergo genetic changes (Kjaerup et al., 2014) . The poor replication fidelity of viral polymerase, resulting in frequent point mutation, recombination, and immune pressure selection, is considered the underlying molecular mechanisms for generation of viral variability and diversity which promotes the evolution of IBV (Jackwood et al., 2012) . Importantly, recombination events are thought to play a key role for IBV evolution. Recombination events between different strains of IBV could result in the emergence of several novel strains, which have further increased the genetic diversity and complexity of IBVs Ren et al., 2019) . Recently, various live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines have been widely and extensively used to prevent IB disease on chicken farms in China, and the detection of some novel strains such as 624I, N1/88, I2217\u22122/16, and JX-17, amongst others, has caused considerable concern, (Quinteros et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2018; Laconi et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2020) . These IBV strains were shown to have originated from recombination events between field and vaccine strains, different types of vaccine strains, or different types of field strains. In the present research, we conducted a recombination analysis on the full-length sequence of the strain CK/ CH/SCMY/160315 in order to reveal its genetic characteristics. Analysis results show that the CK/CH/ SCMY/160315 isolate is a multiple recombinant strain originating from H120, 4/91, LDT3-A and LJL/08-1 strains, all of which are prevalent in the region. The ancestral strains contain 3 vaccine strains, which are . Absolute quantitative RT-qPCR was used to determine viral RNA load level of the trachea, kidney, lung, bursa of Fabricius, cecal tonsil, spleen, and liver. Levels between the challenge group and the negative group were statistically significant at 4, 8, and 12. Asterisk (*) denotes the significant difference from the control group, with significance indicators corresponding to: (\u00c3) significant, P< 0.05; (\u00c3\u00c3) highly significant, P< 0.01; (\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3) very highly significant, P< 0.001. attenuated vaccine strains and commonly used in Southwest China , and the other strain involved in the recombination has a higher mortality rate and is widespread in China (Wang et al., 2020) . However, CK/CH/SCMY/160315 displayed a different recombination pattern compared with other reported LDT3-like strains isolated from 2012 to 2019 in China, and recombination events extended to structural genes such as E and M, indicating the complexity of the emergence of new IBV recombination variant in China. The incidence of recombination events between field and IBV vaccine strains warrants attention because the new recombinant virus may lead to changes in IBV virulence in flocks.",

Previous studies have shown that a key factor in the pathogenesis of IBV is its replicase gene, which could cause reverse inheritance. Other studies have shown that this phenomenon may also be related to accessory proteins (Armesto et al., 2009; Laconi et al., 2018) . Therefore, we explored the pathogenicity of the novel CK/CH/SCMY/160315 strain. Our results suggest a stronger pathogenicity than for other GI-28 strains , which can cause a strong immune response in the body. CK/CH/SCMY/ 160315 induced moderate mortality and exhibited a broader tissue tropism than strains described in previous reports . At necropsy, obvious respiratory and nephritis signs could be seen in the infected flock. Furthermore, we were able to detect the virus in multiple tissues by RT-qPCR, and the amount of viral replication in different tissues varies with the infection time. The trachea, kidneys and lungs are the main sites for IBV replication. As a vaccine strain, LDT3-A is less pathogenic to chickens, while we found that CK/CH/SCMY/160315 is more virulent to chickens in this study. It is speculated that the reason is that the recombination of other genes has changed the pathogenicity of the strain. The results of these pathogenicity experiments show that it is insufficient to evaluate the virulence of the virus strain based on the S1 gene alone. More in-depth research is needed to assess the role of virulence genes, IBV pathogenicity, and gene coordination.",

In addition, the use of multiple vaccine strains increases the risk of recombination between IBVs, and the recombined strains may exhibit higher pathogenicity. For newly emerging IBV strains, more comprehensive sequence determination and studies of biological characteristics are therefore required. Lastly, continuous monitoring is vital for understanding of the evolutionary characteristics of IBV.",

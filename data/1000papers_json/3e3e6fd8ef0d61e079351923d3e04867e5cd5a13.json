In total, 1391 patients were included. The primary end-point was a 43 composite of in-hospital mortality or admission to ICU, whichever came first. The key secondary 44 end-point was in-hospital mortality. 45 Results: Multivariable models were based on 1183 patients with complete data.

However, nutritional screening 88 tools present several intrinsic limitations, which could affect their reliability in this patient's 89 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 109 110 111 112 113 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3. Anthropometry -body weight (to the nearest 0.1 kg) and height (to the nearest 0.5 cm) were 132 measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated (weight [kg]/height [m]) (20). Then, patients 133 were stratified in the following BMI categories: <20.0, 20.0 to 24.9 (reference), 25.0 to 29.9, and 134 \u226530.0 kg/m2. The occurrence of unintentional weight loss in the previous month (yes, no 135 [reference] or unknown) was also investigated. 136 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 157 Center correlation.

This simple and easily obtainable parameter may be 58 useful to identify patients at highest risk of poor prognosis, who may benefit from prompt 59 nutritional support. The presence of comorbidities could be the key factor, which may determine 60 the protective or harmful role of a high body mass index in COVID-19. 66 The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the severe acute 67 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), leads affected patients to develop a complex 68 clinical spectrum, which usually involves the respiratory tract (1) and requires hospitalization for 69 the most severe cases (2), even in a sub-intensive or intensive care unit (ICU) (3, 4) . 70 SARS-CoV-2 infection causes poor clinical outcomes and higher mortality among elderly patients 71 (5) and in those with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, cancer, 72 cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6). 73 Recently, the presence of malnutrition in COVID-19 patients has been detected being a prognostic 74 factor as powerful as older age and comorbidities (7), and associated with prolonged 75 hospitalization (8), disease progression and worse prognosis (9). Based on the available data, 76 hospitalized patients requiring intensive care hospitalization range from 5% to 10%, with greater 77 prevalence among elderly patients (10) , whose nutritional status is more frequently impaired (11). 78 On the other hand, several studies from different countries observed a strong association between 79 high body mass index (BMI) and the increased risk of severe disease and worse prognosis among 80 COVID-19 patients (12). Particularly, a large prospective cohort study showed that obesity 81 increases the risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (13). This appears to be in 82 contrast with the NutritionDay multinational survey, in which a protective role of overweight in 83 hospitalized patients was detected. Accordingly, it was speculated that a high BMI could be a 84 surrogate of nutritional reserves, which may be helpful to counteract the acute stress conditions 85 associated with hospitalization (14). 86 population. This applies also to those recommended for systematic use in the hospital setting, 90 such as the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 tool (NRS-2002) ",

Food intake -patients were inquired about the reduction of food intake in the previous 3-5 days 137 (yes or no) and the expected impairment of intake in the 3-5 days following the assessment was 138 rated (yes or no) by the investigating physicians. Accordingly, patients were divided in 'reduced 139 food categories' as follows: reduced self-reported food intake before hospitalization and expected 140 by physicians in the next days since admission (before and after), reduced self-reported food 141 intake before hospitalization or expected by physicians in the next days since admission (before or 142 after), and none (reference). Continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviations (SDs) or medians and 154 interquartile ranges (IQRs). Categorical variables were described as counts and percentages. We 155 compared survival and event-free survival for a series of candidate risk factors using the log rank 156 test and Cox regression. We computed Huber-White robust standard errors to account for intra-had CRP and LDH available. We computed the Harrell's statistic for model discrimination. We 161 assessed the clinically relevant interaction of BMI and multiple comorbidities and fitted separate 162 models for patients with and without multiple comorbidities. We plotted survival curves using the 163 Kaplan Meier method. 164 We used the STATA software ( Among nutritional parameters, only reduced food intake was associated (P<.001) with both 174 primary and secondary end-points at the univariable analysis ( Figure 1 ). Compared to patients 175 with preserved food intake, patients with reduced self-reported food intake before hospitalization 176 and/or expected by physicians in the next days since admission had a 3. Multivariable models were based on 1183 patients with complete data (events, N=345; deaths, 181 N=278) and reduced self-reported food intake before hospitalization and/or expected by 182 physicians in the next days since admission was found to have a negative prognostic impact for 183 both primary and secondary end-points (Table 2 ). Other predictors of outcome were age and 184 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f presence of multiple comorbidities. A significant association between food intake categories and 185 markers of disease severity (CRP and LDH) was observed (P<.001 for all). Secondary analysis 186 (patients, N=829; events, N=242; deaths, N=200), further adjusted for high (upper quartile of the 187 distribution) CRP (>21 mg/dL) and LDH (>430 mU/mL) levels yielded consistent findings, with 188 increased risk associated also with high LDH levels. 189 However, for both end-points we detected a significant interaction (P<.001) between BMI and the 190 number of comorbidities. Accordingly, the original models were refitted on patients with and 191 without multi-morbidity. In all models, reduced food intake and higher age remained associated This prospective multicenter real-life study showed that reduced self-reported food intake before 288 and/or expected by the physicians after hospital admission, was independently associated with 289 negative clinical outcomes in non-critically ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients and reinforces the 290 hypothesis that early provision of adequate nutrition may be crucial for the successful 291 management of the disease. Although adequately designed intervention trials would be necessary 292 to ascertain whether it represents a cause or a consequence of disease severity, food intake 293 reduction is a simple and easily obtainable parameter, which may be useful to identify COVID-19 294 patients at highest risk of poor prognosis, who may benefit from prompt nutritional support. 295 Finally, the study also suggested that the presence of comorbidities could be the key factor, which 296 may determine the protective or harmful role of a high BMI in COVID-19. study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis. 308 Caccialanza is chief investigator and acts as guarantor for this work.

Interestingly, obesity (BMI\u226530.0 kg/m2) was found to be a risk 193 factor for composite end-point (HR=1.36 [95%CI, 1.03-1.80]; P=.031) and a protective factor 194 against in-hospital mortality (HR=0.32 [95%CI, 0.20-0.51]; P<.001) in patients with and without 195 multiple comorbidities, respectively. Female gender was also associated with lower risk of 196 composite end-point in absence of multiple comorbidities. Further adjustment for CRP and present multicentre prospective real-life study, we investigated the association between the 201 major nutritional screening parameters and clinical outcomes in non-critically ill, hospitalized 202 COVID-19 patients. We found that reduced self-reported food intake before admission and/or 203 expected by the physicians during the first days after hospital admission was an independent 204 determinant of a negative outcome. 205 Although some previous investigations evaluated the impact of nutritional risk in COVID-19 206 patients (15,21), we focused our analysis on the single parameters involved, due to the intrinsic 207 limitations of nutritional screening scores in this patient's population, particularly during the , according to the available literature, the prevalence of malnutrition and nutritional risk 211 is very high among COVID-19 patients and is associated with worse clinical outcomes (22-25). 212 Nutritional risk scores often include parameters like age and disease severity, which increase the 213 probability to detect the risk in acute diseases like COVID-19 and are strongly associated with 214 negative outcomes (26,27). In addition, the commonly used nutritional parameters (i.e., BMI and 215 weight loss) could be misleading or not reliable in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (16,28). For this 216 reason, modified screening procedures have also been arbitrarily proposed (16,25,28). 217 Weight loss was reported only by 12% of our sample at hospital admission and it was unknown in 218 more than one third of patients. Moreover, during the first pandemic wave and the subsequent 219 epidemic peaks, systematic weight and height measurement could result hard or even impossible 220 to perform, due to the usual lack of scales and in consideration of the hygienic precautions 221 required and the associated safety concerns. This may limit the accuracy of nutritional assessment 222 and force to rely on estimated or referred anthropometric values. For the above reasons, we were 223 not able to apply the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria (29) for the 224 proper diagnosis of malnutrition. 225 Several studies reported that obesity is a predictor of negative prognosis as it increases the risk of 226 ICU admission and death in COVID-19 (12). Overweight and obesity have been reported as 227 frequent conditions in the general hospital population (14) and in COVID-19 patients (30), and our 228 data are in line with this evidence, as we detected a prevalence of around 35% and 16%, 229 respectively. However, large hospital population studies such as the NutritionDay multinational 230 survey, showed that overweight is associated with a more favorable outcome (14). Interestingly, in 231 our cohort, obesity in combination with 2 or more comorbidities was associated with , as nutritional reserves could play a key role in counteracting acute stress 236 reactions in hospitalized patients (14). On the other hand, complicated obesity may worsen the 237 clinical conditions of COVID-19 patients with comorbidities, as shown by the available literature 238 (12). Only less than 8% of our sample presented a BMI <20 kg/m 2 at hospital admission. Hence, 239 nutritional risk would have been determined mainly by age and disease severity. Nonetheless, 240 obesity per-se may mask the risk of malnutrition but increased risk could be determined by 241 concomitant sarcopenia (32). Nowadays, the assessment of body composition represents a 242 cornerstone in nutritional science, due to its prognostic value in different clinical conditions (33). 243 Schiaffino et al. observed that low muscle mass detected by CT scans was independently 244 associated with in-hospital mortality and ICU admission among COVID-19 patients (34). On the 245 contrary, a retrospective study observed that bioimpedance analysis does not appear to bring 246 further predictive value than nutritional risk screening alone (35). Despite of the undoubtable 247 value of body composition analysis, it should be acknowledged that it was very hard to perform 248 during the first pandemic wave, due to the emergency scenario and that it may still not be easily 249 available in all the hospitals facing the COVID-19 epidemic. 250The most relevant result of our study was the independent correlation between reduced self-251 reported food intake before admission and/or expected by the physicians during the first days 252 after hospital admission and mortality. Inadequate food intake has been shown to be 253 independently associated with greater infections risk, more frequent complications, prolonged 254 hospitalization, and worse clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients (36,37). This implies that, like255    in the general inpatients population (38), personalized nutritional support is potentially protein requirements were more frequently discharged than those who did not reach their 260 nutritional targets (28). Moreover, it was recently shown that early caloric deficit may 261 independently contribute to worsening survival in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients (41).262    Due to the observational nature of our study, it should be obviously still clarified whether reduced 263 food intake represents a cause or a consequence of disease severity, but it is certainly an easily 264 obtainable parameter, which could be useful in the daily clinical practice to identify high-risk 265 patients who may benefit from prompt nutritional support. Interestingly, food intake reduction266    was associated with markers of disease severity, such as CRP and LDH serum concentration.267 However, in line with previous evidences (36,37), in our study the association between self-268 reported and/or expected food intake reduction and clinical outcomes resulted independent of 269 some of the acknowledged prognostic factors in COVID-19, i.e. age, number of comorbidities, CRP 270 and LDH. Hence, it may also be interesting to assess this variable in future intervention trials, even 271 if they are objectively difficult to perform in COVID-19, particularly due to the ethical issues 272 related to a possible arm including intentionally undernourished patients. 273 A further potential limitation of our study could be the inclusion bias associated with the setting of 274 care. Our population consisted of particularly severe patients, being the Institutions involved 275 relevant referral hospitals in their territories. 276 From a methodological point of view, we are aware of the intrinsic limitations of the parameters 277 considered and that nutritional assessment, including food intake estimation, should be 278 systematically repeated during hospitalization. Ideally, GLIM criteria (29) should have been taken 279 in to consideration for the proper diagnosis of malnutrition.",

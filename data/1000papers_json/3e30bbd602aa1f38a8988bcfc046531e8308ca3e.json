This study explores the acceptance of use of mobile phone data (MPD) in different areas, and how it is related to different types of trust. Based on a representative survey of citizens in the two smart cities, Oslo and Tallinn, four similar trust cultures are located. The acceptance of use of MPD differed significantly between the trust cultures and, as expected, was significantly stronger in groups with higher levels of trust, either generally or in terms of reliance on technologies. The acceptance of use of MPD for commercial product development was low for all groups. Findings suggest that future users of MPD need to be aware of the significant scepticism toward and rejection of the use of such data in large parts of the population. Unless visions of the smart city are grounded in the needs and wants of citizens, such plans are not likely to succeed, and negative understandings and images of a panoptic state may take stronger hold. As for now, however, there seems to be insufficient social trust to exploit this on a wider scale without creating even more scepticism and distrust.",

In contrast to traditional survey data, this represents \"passive data\", in the sense that it is not collected through active solicitation, but is generated by phone operators or service providers for other purposes (Chen et al., 2016) . Several studies have looked at the challenges and risks involved in extensive use of mobility data, in particular issues connected to citizens' privacy (Steenbruggen et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018) . In connection with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), anonymization of MPD is crucial, because the re-identification of individuals must not be possible according to European law. However, full anonymization is challenging, and often decreases the utility of the data, which means that the benefits of the data cannot fully be exploited (Berzina and Lauberte, 2018) .",

            "text": "Harvesting of big data is a cornerstone in the development of smart cities. Neoliberal urbanism has dominated previous research on smart cities, which can be summarized as a market-based view centered on economic growth (Cardullo and Kitchin, 2018) . However, recent contributions have focussed on the transition from smart cities to experimental cities and \"smart citizens\" (Cardullo and Kitchin, 2018; I. Calzada, 2018) . This perspective can be seen as a response to the increasing criticism of smart cities as being overly technology-driven and neglecting public and common interests (Hollands, 2008; Grossi and Pianezzi, 2017) . The introduction of the GDPR in 2018 started a debate on the digital rights of citizens, i.e. about the ownership of data, data privacy and transparency. Furthermore, cities such as Barcelona are in the process of establishing a more democratic data ownership regime, following an experimental city policy framework (Cardullo and Kitchin, 2018; Calzada, 2018; Evans et al., 2018) . The bottom-up perspective on smart cities means developing new ways to include citizens and adopting an inclusive and deliberative framing of citizen participation in the smart city (Cardullo and Kitchin, 2018) . The voices of citizens are crucial to gaining acceptance and avoiding violations, conflict and distrust, yet few studies take the perspective of the citizens into account (Thomas et al., 2016; Vanolo, 2016) .",

            "text": "This paper aims to illuminate how citizens perceive the sharing of information about their movements with mobile phone operators and their wider circle of customers, partners and subcontractors. The use of passive data is undoubtedly a challenge to privacy policies, which influence the everyday life of ordinary citizens, and the use of such data cannot be governed top-down and only discussed in expert debates about data protection (Minkkinen et al., 2017; Calzada and Cobo, 2015) . The general awareness among the public about the existence and use of such data is also relatively limited (IET 2016) . Trust is a key factor in the acceptance of technology-based systems that can be used for surveillance, such as MPD (B\u00e9langer and Carter, 2008; Wong, 2008; Yeh, 2017) . Trust can be based on various sources and processes; it is also volatile and differently distributed between geographical regions, organizations and social groups (Bachmann and Zaheer, 2006; Markova et al., 2008) . In the context of nations and regions the term trust cultures has been used to distinguish between societies on the basis of their level of interpersonal trust and shared ethical values (Fukuyama, 1995; Natale et al., 1998) . The question is whether there is sufficient trust within modern societies to implement MPD-based tracking. In this paper, we ask the following questions: What types of trust cultures exist in Oslo and Tallinn? To what extent do trust cultures differ between national contexts? How does affiliation with such groups influence acceptance of the use of MPD data? Based on a comparative survey analysis we explore and describe local trust cultures that delineate groups holding different views on security, privacy and confidence in third parties and potential users. As we will show, within these cultures there are very different views on the acceptance of MPD. To achieve future acceptance, it will be necessary to seek support from trust cultures that so far have been reluctant to share their positional data.",

Although it has been researched for over two decades (Mora et al., 2017) the concept still lacks a concrete definition (Hollands, 2008; Glasmeier and Nebiolo, 2016) . The knowledge about smart cities is rapidly growing and extremely fragmented, and lacks intellectual exchange between researchers in the field. In their analysis of the smart city literature, Mora et al. find that the most cited documents are based on two dominant interpretations of the smart city (Mora et al., 2017) . The first understands smart cities holistically as combining human, social, cultural, economic, environmental, and technological aspects. The second takes a techno-centric view of them. Reflecting these interpretations, the literature on smart cities has been criticized for being insufficiently nuanced, using one-size-fits-all narratives, and failing to use in-depth empirical studies and comparative research to underpin the arguments (Kitchin, 2015) .",

            "text": "The research on smart cities is still at an early stage of development. Much still focuses on the understanding of smart cities, often providing illustrative case studies of smart city programmes, public documents and debates (Grossi and Pianezzi, 2017; Vanolo, 2016; Vanolo, 2014; Albino et al., 2015; Luque-Ayala and Marvin, 2015) . It is important to recognize that \"smart\" technologies function on top of already existing structures and actors, at best promoting incremental change (Cowley et al., 2018; Gaffney and Robertson, 2018) . This implies that there is no such thing as a singular \"smart city\", because cities are heterogeneously structured within different societies. The term smart cities is part of an ongoing debate on where cities are heading. However, as Thomas et al. (Thomas et al., 2016) note, the term is not perceived as inviting inclusive debate, because citizens find it distant and abstract. Investigations in the UK show that few citizens are familiar with the concept of smart cities. A UK survey found that only one in five adults is familiar with the term (IET 2016). Similarly, Thomas et al. found that most of the interviewees were unfamiliar with it. In general, it seems that citizens lack interest in smart cities (Thomas et al., 2016; Cowley et al., 2018) . However, much of the \"smartness\" consists of unseen technological infrastructure and objects undetectable by the majority of citizens.",

Calzada, 2018; Calzada, 2018) focuses on data ownership, grass-roots innovations and co-operative service provision models when analysing the digital plan for Barcelona. He asks whether we are going from smart cities to experimental cities, and how citizens become decision makers rather than data providers. Using data ethically in order to protect citizens and involving citizens in decisions on how data is used are issues that cities are currently experimenting with and constantly need to address in the future.",

In the context of urban development, big data differs from traditional data used to understand human mobility, as it consists of real-time data that has been gathered and stored for other purposes.

            "text": "There are several kinds of big data, but in transport-related studies one of the most frequently used and discussed types is mobile phone data (MPD), which is generated from mobile phone locational systems and the motion systems integrated into smart phones. Location information is generated as a result of a phone's communication with a cellular network maintained and operated by cellular network operators (Li et al., 2017) . It can be registered when a user initiates a connection between the phone and the network through one or more cell towers, or by means of regular updates of geographic position based on the user's movement between different towers in a network. In addition, a number of sources for gathering locational data are built into mobile smartphones or other wireless networks in the city. These include GPS receivers in the smartphones, wi-fi positioning, motion systems, and accelerometer functions. Used in combination, these data sources can extract travel behavior data that is comprehensive and detailed (Wang et al., 2018) . Such data is increasingly exploited in various mobile phone application used for sports activities, navigation and social networks. D.T.E. Julsrud and D.J.R. Krogstad Technological Forecasting & Social Change 161 (2020) 120314 The increased interest in MPD rests on the fact that access to mobile phones has become ubiquitous in every city, town and village in the world. There are now almost five billion mobile phones users, and an estimated 62.9 percent of the global population already owned a mobile phone in 2016. 1 The mobile phone has become an integral part of everyday life, and it has also become a favourite companion for travellers, used for trip planning, organization and navigating. Studies indicate that mobile devices are widely used while on the move, to get information from websites, read email, watch movies, communicate with friends and much more (Julsrud and Denstadli, 2017; Lyons and Chatterjee, 2012; Kenyon and Lyons, 2007; Lyons et al., 2007) . The new generation of 5 G mobile networks and new smart phone models make the tracking of urban populations even more accurate and accessible (Gregersen and Lunke, 2018) . In the current smart cities, data from mobile phones is part of a large web of various big data sources connecting humans and technologies that can increase the value of CDRdata. These include data from smart card readers, information from \"blue tooth beacons\", traffic data and more.",

In innovation studies, social psychological theories are widely applied in studies about adoption of new services in society. In particular, Theory of Planned Behaviour (TBP) (Ajzen, 1991) and its offshoots such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Technology Acceptance Model (UTAUT) have been influential. Key assumptions in the latter group of theories are that underlying attitudes, expected ease of use, and perceived usefulness of a technology are decisive for acceptance (Venkatesh et al., 2003; Davis, 1989) . Though initially developed for the field of information system adoption, these theories have been applied to a number of other fields, including e-government (B\u00e9langer and Carter, 2008) , information systems in organizations (Horst et al., 2007) , mobile applications (Beldad and Hegner, 2018) and online shopping (Gefen et al., 2003) . Despite their popularity, the reliability and usefulness of these theories has been questioned, among other things for ignoring the dynamic social aspects of adoption processes (Legris et al., 2003; Benbasat and Barki, 2007) .",

While the decision whether to adopt or reject a technology is seen as active and rational in TBP or TAM, this is usually not the case for mobile phone data. Acceptance can be done implicitly by a lack of resistance or simply through the use of services that are based on mobility positioning. In many cases, however, users will not know how their data is used, even when they have downloaded an application and clicked on the accept button. Secondly, the risks of abuse and/or the possible benefits of acceptance are very hard for regular travellers to comprehend when it comes to the use of passive data, due to its high level of complexity. Another issue is that acceptance for sharing of mobile data is not necessarily similar across all domains or situations. Even research using the traditional technology acceptance models has found that they perform differently in different cultural settings, and that some factors may be more or less important in one culture than another (Straub et al., 1997; Choi and Geistfeld, 2004) . Thus, a single model for acceptance of technologies across cultures tends to obscure the variations and dynamics involved.",

Whether a certain technology is perceived as a threat to privacy or as a benefit to society depends on the particular cultural context and historical narratives that it links up to. Although various definitions exist, cultures can briefly be described as belief systems that shape individuals' schemas about the world around them (Schein, 1985) . Following a cultural sociological approach, interpretation of the meaning, risks and benefits related to smart cities and big data must be seen as part of an ongoing discourse within a culture. The active development of common understanding of phenomena and social events is often described in sociological literature as \"framing\". \"Collective action frames\" represent sets of beliefs and meanings that are used to make sense of events and happenings in the world (Leonardi, 2011; Benford and Snow, 2000; Goffman, 1974) .",

This directly evokes the concept of trust, which in general terms can be defined as a \"psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of another\" [ (Rousseau et al., 1998), p. 395 ]. According to Luhmann (Luhmann, 1988 ) trust arises as a demand for \"reduction of complexity\" and is based on the delegation of decisions and responsibilities. Giving others access to individual mobility data involves trust because it creates a vulnerability that is handled by belief in the positive intentions of others, as a way to handle high complexity. As a social phenomenon, trust operates on different levels. Generalized trust, i.e. to what extent people believe that most other people can be trusted, is seen as a particularly important dimension of a national culture, with significant impact on how new innovations, events or social changes are handled (Fukuyama, 1995; Uslaner, 2006; Putnam, 2000) . Following Putnam interpersonal trust, together with networks and norms, is a key element in the concept of social capital (Putnam, 2000) . When people are engaged in establishing social networks and relations, norms and shared values develop. A society is constituted by a well-established network of social relations, and this constitutes a shared resource (i.e. social capital) which is beneficial for the society as a whole [(Field, 2003) , p. 65]. Hence, general trust is used by Putnam as an indicator of social capital in societies. Empirical studies have repeatedly documented significant variation in the level of general trust across nations, which is generally explained by cultural differences (Inglehardt and Weltzel, 2005; Edelman 2019 ). Institutional trust is slightly different, as it is related to social institutions and is believed to be of particular importance for the stability of societies and cultures (Zucker, 1986; Hardin, 2006) . It reflects how secure one feels about a situation because of guarantees, safety nets and other structures, and the belief that things are normal and customary and that everything seems to be in proper order (McKnight et al., 1998) . Relying on advanced technologies and algorithms to handle coordination of urban processes involves an increasing amount of what sometimes is described as yet another form of trust: systemic trust or technology based trust (Luhmann, 1979) . Although trust in technological systems is of significance in many emerging fields, it can be contested whether this actually accords with the definition of trust given above, or rather falls under the concept of confidence (M\u00f6llering, 2006) .",

First, Norway and Oslo have experienced stable economic growth and have a standard of living that is among the highest in the EU region and a well-developed welfare system. Norwegian citizens, according to repeated studies, have high levels of general trust and trust in public institutions, which arguably are crucial factors for further acceptance of many smart city applications (Andreasson, 2017) . Estonia and Tallinn have lower economic wealth and equity, although the modern Estonian state has experienced rapid economic development after gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. This historical backdrop may have caused suspicion of digital control and surveillance, but also enthusiasm due to the country's shift to a new national leadership and the development of stronger democratic institutions. Cross-national studies have indicated increased levels of trust in the government and public institutions during the last decades, suggesting that this latter line of development has been taking place (Zmerli, 2012) .",

For trust on an institutional level, informants were asked to indicate trustfulness toward a list of eleven public and private organizations that in some form or another can be expected to harvest or use MPD through telecom data or mobile applications. This included public health services, banks and insurance companies, telecom operators, domestic revenue services, the police and more. For trust in government, we asked to what extent they trusted the present government, the political parties, the parliament, the justice system, and public authorities.

A closer look at the groups revealed a significant degree of similarities, and each of the national groups had matching groups in the other city, though with distinct national variations. Thus, the clusters were given the same names, although local variations are evident. These four trust cultures can briefly be described as follows: Techno trust: This is a group that has strong trust in the possibility to develop better cities and transport systems based on data from digital mobile phone data, while its trust in societal institutions or political bodies is not very high. In both cities this includes about one third of the sample, and members are middle aged or older with good education.

In contrast, more than 60% in both cities accepted the use of mobility positioning to protect against terrorism and crime, over 50% to develop better public transport, and over 40% for research purposes. On a general level, then, citizens in the two cities were highly aligned on these questions, although the Estonians displayed a slightly higher level of acceptance of the three most important areas.

The majority of citizens in Oslo and Tallinn in general do not accept the use of such applications, even if the purpose is to benefit society. This means that achieving broad acceptance of further implementation and use requires new governance models and ways of involving citizens. To the extent that citizens do accept use of their data, it is to protect their city against terrorism and crime, for the development of transport services and for research purposes. Use of MPD for the development of commercial products and services is less accepted and approved. European city governments are already becoming aware of their political and institutional power to secure ethical use of data (Calzada, 2018) . dialog with and engagement of citizens outside the traditional forms of citizen involvement are becoming increasingly important, and as a result knowledge possessed by citizens, not only knowledge about citizens, is being included in political initiatives (Vesnic-Alujevic et al., 2019) Acceptance of sharing positioning data from mobile phones inevitably involves a significant risk of abuse, and needs to be based on some form of trust among the users. As we have documented in Oslo and Tallinn, we find different trust cultures among citizens based on different understandings of whom to trust and the risks involved. While one of the four groups seems to share a high level of general trust in the political system, including institutions that can benefit from such data, two other groups display strong trust related to the technological possibilities. One of the groups, including a large number of young citizens, had high trust in net-based platforms. This may resonate with the argument recently proposed by Rachel Botsman that in the near future, trust will be based on Internet-based peer-to-peer platforms in ways that make social and institutional trust less relevant (Botsman, 2017) .",

However, this shows that the findings are robust (i.e. have high external validity) and that similar structures can probably be found in other European cities. In both cities, we see evidence of a younger generation that trusts webenterprises more than state institutions. The data also suggest that the share of people adhering to a low-trust culture is higher in Tallinn, and that they generally have a lower level of trust in political institutions. This might be possible to trace back to historical political cultures and the lack of durable democratic institutions in the former Eastern Bloc nations. The recent Covid 19 pandemic may serve as an example. Several European countries have developed mobile software applications that track the geographical location of app users in response to the crisis. In Norway, where trust in political institutions is high, almost 30 percent of the population downloaded the app during 2 months. In June however, the government stopped the app due to privacy concerns from the Norwegian Data Protection Authority. In Estonia, the government has called on nine companies to help with a privacy-preserving approach to develop an app (O'Neil et al., 2020) . ",

Although Oslo and Tallinn are different societies in many respects, these differences are not very strongly reflected in how the citizens view sharing of data. This indicates that also other cities and policy makers can make use the four trust cultures established in this study, as a basis when finding ways to exploit mobility positioning data in the development of their cities. As we have seen, the typical \"trusting citizen\" is currently a minority in Oslo and Tallinn. If the citizens consider it safe to share their data and discover the benefits this can have for their mobility and everyday life, they might develop positive attitudes towards sharing their individual data. In light of the Covid 19 pandemic, we experienced that a crisis makes the inhabitants more willing to share their data, even when privacy costs are high.

An important part of doing this is to establish new arenas where people can engage in discussions about the future use of these kinds of data. City governments that want to exploit mobility data should develop new forms for community engagement where all stakeholder groups, including citizens, are represented (Konsti-Laakso and Rantala, 2017). For example, city governments can establish urban laboratories involving local communities and volunteer associations, as well as public and private enterprises. Several scholars describe urban experiments as a fruitful way to enable reflexive and multi-dimensional learning in real-life settings (Evans et al., 2018) . This presupposes that citizens are recognized not as mere passive consumers of services, but as active participants in and potential contributors to the shaping of a \"smarter\" urban environment (Grossi and Pianezzi, 2017; Calzada, 2018) . On the other hand, it would also require more fundamental consideration of how to build up trust in different segments of society, and in particular among those who today largely distrust political institutions. The latter represent a large group of citizens in both Oslo and Tallinn, and many young people are part of cultures that mainly put trust in net-based actors, not in political institutions. Harvesting mobility data demands that policy makers, researchers and technology providers enter into a dialog with these groups. In the current political climate in Europe, with decreasing levels of trust in political leaders in many countries, this would require significant efforts. 6 One way forward will be to establish arenas and events where boundary-crossing relationships and trust can be developed through face-to-face meetings. As argued by Calzada et al. (Calzada and Cobo, 2015) social capital and trust will suffer as long as smart cities are only based on digital social networks.",

            "text": "The findings in this study are evidence that acceptance of the use of MPD is highly sensitive to the particular contexts of its use. Although the majority of citizens are critical, acceptance increases significantly when the purpose has a high perceived social value. At this point, our research supports earlier work indicating that acceptance of the sharing of private data, including positioning data, depends on the context of use (Nissenbaum, 2010; Martin and Shilton, 2016) . Although we have limited information on such contexts given the design of our survey, we do find indications that citizens' acceptance and concerns regarding privacy differ across situations of use. As argued by Nissenbaum (Nissenbaum, 2010) , acceptance of the use of privacy data depends on access to information about who the recipients and users of the data are, the information types that are shared, the principles for transmission and the intended uses. Only limited information is currently available to people tracked by mobile positioning systems, and this probably represents a significant barrier to the development of knowledge, norms and meaning in this area. This echoes other studies that have found that attitudes to sharing of locational data to a large degree depends on expected social benefits and the level of trust to the involved organizations (Oliver et al., 2015; Murphy et al., 2020; Julsrud and Krogstad, 2018) .",

            "text": "Despite the fact that a large part of the population was opposed to sharing of their mobility data, the number of smartphone users using applications that require positioning data was high in our sample. This apparently self-contradictory behavior can be related to the \"privacy paradox\" (Hull, 2015; Gerber et al., 2018) ) according to which people continue to use digital data despite knowing about risks related to it. However, many of the current applications for urban travellers, such as real-time routing information and navigation applications are increasingly necessary tools for managing efficiently in cities, making them hard to do without. This may explain why some of the distrusters and net-based trusters in the survey accepted the use of MPD to some degree. It does not follow, however, that they ignore the risk of privacy violations. Studies of young people have found that many intensive users of social media also routinely engage in privacy-protective behavior (Marwick and Boyd, 2014) . The current study adds to other works that have found that younger people are more aware of the possibilities for abuse of mobile phone data but also more accepting for sharing data (Murphy et al., 2020; DMA 2018) 6 According to a recent global survey of trust, over the last two decades we have seen a progressive destruction of trust in societal institutions, a consequence of the 2008 recession, fears about immigration, and economic dislocation caused by globalization and automation (Edelman 2019) Edelman, \"Trust Barometer.

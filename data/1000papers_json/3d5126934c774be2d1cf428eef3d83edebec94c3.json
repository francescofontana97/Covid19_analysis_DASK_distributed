However, the optimal respiratory support method is still under debate. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of various respiratory support methods used for preventive purposes after scheduled extubation in critically ill medical patients. Methods: A systematic database search was performed from inception to December 19, 2019, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a preventive use of different respiratory support methods, including conventional oxygen therapy (COT), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT), and combinational use of HFOT and NIV (HFOT+NIV), after planned extubation in adult critically ill medical patients.

No significant difference in the re-intubation rate or short-term mortality was found among NIV, HFOT, and HFOT+NIV. The treatment rankings based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) from best to worst for re-intubation rate were HFOT+NIV (95.1%), NIV (53.4%), HFOT (51.2%), and COT (0.3%), and the rankings for shortterm mortality were NIV (91.0%), HFOT (54.3%), HFOT+NIV (43.7%), and COT (11.1%).

Therefore, it is essential for mechanically ventilated patients to receive daily assessments of weaning readiness [6] and timely extubation when they meet the criteria of weaning from IMV. However, approximately 10-20% of patients will experience extubation failure and require re-intubation within 24-72 h after scheduled extubation [7] [8] [9] [10] , and extubation failure is associated with poor outcomes and increased mortality [8] .

COT can only deliver a maximum flow of oxygen (O 2 ) of 15 L/min using the Venturi mask or reservoir mask [11] , and the delivered fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) is unstable because the FiO 2 also depends on the inspiratory flow, respiration rate, and tidal volume of patients in addition to the O 2 flow [12] . Hence, apart from improving oxygenation, COT seems to have no or minimal effects on changes in lung aeration, hemodynamics, or neuromuscular function, which are the main pathophysiological mechanisms that contributed to extubation failure [12] . In recent years, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) have been increasingly used as alternative respiratory support methods in post-extubated patients. Both NIV and HFOT are anticipated to prevent extubation failure and improve prognosis by delivering more stable FiO 2 [12, 13] , promoting alveolar recruitment and preventing alveolar collapse [14] [15] [16] , and reducing the work of breathing [17, 18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 221, "end": 225, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 426, "end": 430, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 672, "end": 676, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 979, "end": 983, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 984, "end": 987, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1058, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1063, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1068, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1110, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1114, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, the latest meta-analysis [19] of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggested that compared to COT, preventive use of NIV after extubation had no effect on the re-intubation rate or mortality in post-extubated patients.

More recently, a multicenter RCT [23] proposed a novel method that combined the use of HFOT and NIV (HFOT+NIV) and proved its superiority over HFOT in the prevention of re-intubation in post-extubated patients. However, the method did not affect mortality. Although the above studies are informative, the relative effectiveness throughout various respiratory support methods remains unknown. Unlike conventional pairwise meta-analysis that only include head-to-head comparisons, network meta-analysis (NMA) can compare multiple treatments simultaneously in a single analysis by combining direct and indirect evidence [24] and inform on the relative effect of indirectly compared treatments.

The findings suggested the superiority of NIV over COT in terms of re-intubation, short-term mortality, and post-extubation respiratory failure. Compared to COT, HFOT had beneficial effects on the re-intubation rate and post-extubation respiratory failure but not short-term mortality. There were similar treatment effects on the primary and secondary outcomes among NIV, HFOT, and HFOT+NIV. Although HFOT+NIV ranked best for reducing the risk of re-intubation, it exhibited the potential to increase short-term mortality compared with NIV. Therefore, to comprehensively prevent re-intubation and short-term death, prophylactic use of NIV after scheduled extubation is probably the most effective respiratory support method in critically ill medical patients, especially those with a high risk of extubation failure. Respiratory support has been widely applied to prevent post-extubation respiratory failure, treat respiratory failure that developed after extubation, or facilitate early weaning from IMV in patients who have failed SBT [12] . Currently, routine use of COT remains the mainstay of preventive respiratory support in post-extubated patients. Since the low-flow oxygen delivered by COT is insufficient to generate positive airway pressure, COT may not guarantee adequate gas exchange to meet the demand of critically ill patients, especially those who were intubated for medical diseases, such as heart failure and COPD. Several RCTs have proven that preventive use of NIV or HFOT after planned extubation was an effective alternative approach [26, 37, 38, 41, 42, [44] [45] [46] . However, the most recent pairwise meta-analysis by Maitra et al. [19] concluded that NIV was not superior to COT in terms of prevention of re-intubation or death. Interestingly, in addition to trials that used NIV as a preventive strategy after planned extubation, the meta-analysis by Maitra et al. [19] also included trials in which NIV was applied as a facilitative or therapeutic strategy and trials in which patients received unplanned extubation. Moreover, at least two studies [37, 40] were missed in their meta-analysis [19] . Thus, substantial heterogeneity was identified across the included trials in their study [19] , and their evidence had a low quality. Regarding the comparison of HFOT and COT, the two latest meta-analyses [20, 22] drew contradictory conclusions. The meta-analysis by Xu et al. [22] found a beneficial effect of HFOT on re-intubation. However, the meta-analysis by Zhu et al. [20] revealed no effects on re-intubation or mortality with the use of HFOT. Unfortunately, the two meta-analyses included a heterogeneous population that comprised post-surgical patients and critically ill medical patients. Moreover, the study by Zhu et al. [20] pooled results from RCTs and crossover studies. These factors might contribute to the above conflicting results. In contrast, a relatively homogeneous population of critically ill medical patients who received preventive respiratory support after planned extubation was recruited in our NMA. Network estimates suggested the benefits of NIV on the reintubation rate and short-term mortality and the benefit of HFOT on the re-intubation rate compared with COT. These findings raised the question of why the benefits of HFOT on re-intubation could not be translated into survival benefits, but NIV could. It might be explained by the following: first, NIV could provide a higher positive airway pressure than HFOT. The high positive airway pressure delivered by NIV increases the intrathoracic pressure, which is analogous to IMV; reduces the left ventricular preload and afterload; and improves the cardiac performance [12] ; these features might translate into a better prognosis in medical patients with cardiac failure. In addition, COPD is another one primary disease leading to ICU admission in most of the included trials in our study. Due to the generation of higher positive airway pressure, NIV may be more effective than HFOT in facilitating decarboxylation in COPD patients. This may be another one reason for interpreting the survival benefits of NIV. Finally, HFOT is more comfortable compared with COT or NIV [46] [47] [48] .

A multicenter RCT [27] found similar effects on the re-intubation rate and ICU mortality between HFOT and NIV. Our NMA also further confirmed the similar effectiveness of NIV and HFOT on the re-intubation rate and short-term mortality, which was consistent with the results of previous meta-analyses [21, 22] . Combinational use of HFOT and NIV seems to be a promising method in postextubated patients because the addition of HFOT to NIV could, at least theoretically, further improve gas exchange and decrease the work of breathing. The HIGH-WEAN study [23] indicated that re-intubation rate and post-extubation respiratory failure were reduced with HFOT+NIV compared with HFOT alone. Our NMA also suggested that HFOT+NIV ranked first for the prevention of re-intubation rate and post-extubation respiratory failure.

Sensitivity analysis also indicated that NIV remains the most effective method in nonhypercapnic critically ill medical patients. However, an observational study by Gong et al. [54] found a conflicting result that prophylactic NIV could not reduce re-intubation or hospital mortality in COPD patients with PaCO 2 < 45 mmHg.

First, to our knowledge, this is the first NMA to evaluate the comparative efficacies of various respiratory support methods in post-extubated critically ill patients. NMA allows the comparison of multiple treatments simultaneously in a single analysis and improves the precision by combining direct and indirect estimates. Second, a more homogeneous population was enrolled in this NMA. To improve the transitivity across comparisons and reduce the heterogeneity across included trials, we set strict inclusion criteria that only critically ill medical patients who were treated with preventive respiratory support after planned extubation could be included. Third, we performed sensitivity analyses to eliminate the influence of two potential effect modifiers on the NMA results and confirmed the robustness of the NMA results. Other strengths included a comprehensive literature search and application of GRADE methodology to assess the quality of evidence. This NMA had some limitations. First, we did not construct a comparison-adjusted funnel plot to assess the presence of small-study effects due to limited studies in each direct comparison. Therefore, the possible overestimation of effect size in studies with a small sample size should be considered when interpreting the results. Second, although it is difficult to identify the effect modifiers in an NMA, we performed two sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the NMA results. However, there were also other differences among the included studies that potentially influenced the NMA results, including sample size, duration of respiratory support, and primary disease lead to IMV. Unfortunately, we did not perform sensitivity analysis for these factors given the limited information in the included studies. Third, the adverse complications were not analyzed in this NMA because the definition of adverse complications was largely different among included trials. Thus, we had no insight into the safety of various respiratory support approaches. Fourth, the pooled results of this NMA might have a potential bias given the lack of blindness in all included trials. Finally, we redefined Forest plot of network meta-analysis for short-term mortality. NIV noninvasive ventilation, HFOT high-flow oxygen therapy, COT conventional oxygen therapy, CI confidence interval high risk of extubation failure according to the previously published studies given that no consistent definition of \"high risk\" is available to date.

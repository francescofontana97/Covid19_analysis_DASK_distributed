The primary outcomes are: (1) to assess the safety and tolerability of seven serial infusions of vedolizumab at each of three doses; (2) to identify the immunovirological measures, including pVL and T cell kinetics, that characterize HIV/ART cases before, during, after vedolizumab treatment and ATI; and (3) to seek SVR of pVL after ATI. Secondary outcomes will include immune reconstitution and pVL suppression as well as immune reconstitution and long-term safety following re-initiation of ART in the absence of SVR.",

This anti-\u03b14\u03b27 mAb was administered serially every three weeks at 50 mg/kg for 8 doses to acutely-infected macaques on ART and was followed by ATI and subsequent discontinuation of mAb administration. SVR and low GALT-associated VLs for 24 months was observed in eight of eleven animals, after a low-level pVL rebound in five of the eight. In these animals, (Byrareddy, unpublished) . The mechanism of this post-treatment control is unknown, and later attempts to replicate this finding have been unsuccessful. [4] [5] [6] One human trial of vedolizumab in HIV infection did not observe SVR, 7 although ATI was brief and limited by design. In human HIV infection, SVR over time without evidence of progressive immunodeficiency in the absence of ART would meet definitional criteria of a \"functional cure\", where pVL suppression is maintained without ART and without eradication of virus.",

We describe a dose-and exposure-finding pilot trial in healthy adults with ART-treated chronic HIV infection to assess vedolizumab safety and anti-HIV activity or SVR after ATI. This trial proposal is of a short duration (~one year) and simple design to assess short-term safety and tolerance of vedolizumab according to dose. It will also assess whether pVL rebound and/or SVR occurs after ATI, in relation to dose, duration and systemic exposure to vedolizumab.",

The anticipated mechanism of possible SVR with short-term vedolizumab intervention is not an eradication or a virological cure, but a functional cure with immunologicalmaintained viral suppression in absence of ART and after withdrawal of the intervention. This trial design accommodates the collection and cryopreservation of biological specimens (sera, plasma, peripheral blood lymphocytes, rectal biopsy samples, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stool) that will permit mechanistic immunological and virological studies in the event that treatment effects are seen.",

            "text": "The HAVARTI trial is designed as a single-arm, dose-ranging pilot trial. No placebo control arm will be used because: 1) this is an exploratory pilot study of a novel investigational agent, 2) pVL rebound occurs reliably after analytical or other ART interruption, and the SVR outcome of interest is not a small effect, and 3) in small trials, neither randomization nor controls may protect from large expected biases related to biological variation. Placebo controls from an Ottawa/Montreal RCT of therapeutic HIV vaccination using ALVAC with or without Remune experienced a median time to viral rebound of ~2 weeks 16 after ATI and will be used as an historical control for comparison, among other more recent reports and studies. ATI, the intentional interruption of suppressive ART to assess an investigational product's ability to induce virologic control, remains the gold-standard for investigation of novel therapies for HIV cure research. 17 Although the SMART study conducted in the context of clinical management research showed that participants who interrupted ART were at higher risk of developing AIDS and non-AIDS events compared to those who did not interrupt ART, 18 it also revealed that ATI can be done safely when the individual has suppressed plasma viremia (pVL < 50 copies/ml), high current CD4 count (>500 cells/\u03bcl) and high CD4 nadir (>200 cells/\u03bcl), in the context of a carefully monitored trial. 1 19-21 Therefore, participants in the HAVARTI trial will be screened for these inclusion criteria to decrease risks associated with ART interruption in a different context. Furthermore, successful re-initiation of ART and suppression of pVL is a priority, so prospective study participants will not have a history of drug-resistant HIV, treatment-refractory pVL response, or non-adherence to ART.",

Primatized anti-\u03b14\u03b27 mAb has Fc-receptor avid Fc-fragment, whereas vedolizumab is a masking antibody, without Fc-receptor avidity. 22 23 Macaques were infused 24 with robust saturation at doses of 2 mg/kg. 25 Vedolizumab is shown to be clinically effective for IBD at doses of 0.5mg/kg -2mg/kg, 26 27 with 300mg per infusion being the recommended dose for IBD patients. 9 The half-life of vedolizumab is 18-25.5 days 28 29 versus a half-life of 11.4 days for the \u03b14\u03b27 mAb used in the macaque study, therefore, after initial loading of three doses over 5 weeks, the regular dosing interval is 4 weeks for this study as compared to 3 weeks in the macaque study. Finally, participants will receive 7 infusions of vedolizumab instead of the 8 received by macaques. In the macaque study, pVL suppression was evident by 6 weeks after ATI in all treated animals. Viral rebound occurred within 2 weeks in 5 of 8 animals and was subsequently re-suppressed within 4 weeks. 3 Virologic control was therefore robust throughout the remaining \u03b14\u03b27 mAb treatments and after its discontinuation. The number of necessary infusions is unclear, however data from the macaque model suggests that immunologic control developed early after withdrawal of ART, and that ongoing mAb therapy after viral suppression may not be necessary.",

This anti-\u03b14\u03b27 mAb was administered serially every three weeks at 50 mg/kg for 8 doses to acutely-infected macaques on ART and was followed by ATI and subsequent discontinuation of mAb administration. SVR and low GALT-associated VLs for 24 months was observed in eight of eleven animals, after a low-level pVL rebound in five of the eight. In these animals, (Byrareddy, unpublished) . The mechanism of this post-treatment control is unknown, and later attempts to replicate this finding have been unsuccessful. [4] [5] [6] One small human trial of vedolizumab in HIV infection did not observe SVR 7 , but was limited in its ability to detect post-rebound suppression. In human HIV infection, SVR over time without evidence of progressive immunodeficiency in the absence of ART would meet definitional criteria of a \"functional cure\", where pVL suppression is maintained without ART and without eradication of virus.",

No placebo control arm will be used because: 1) this is an exploratory pilot study of a novel investigational agent, 2) pVL rebound occurs reliably after analytical or other ART interruption, and the SVR outcome of interest is not a small effect, and 3) in small trials, neither randomization nor controls may protect from large expected biases related to biological variation. Placebo controls from an Ottawa/Montreal RCT of therapeutic HIV vaccination using ALVAC with or without Remune experienced a median time to viral rebound of ~2 weeks 17 after ATI and will be used as an historical control for comparison, among other more recent reports and studies. ATI, the intentional interruption of suppressive ART to assess an investigational product's ability to induce virologic control, remains the gold-standard for investigation of novel therapies for HIV cure research. 18 Although the SMART study conducted in the context of clinical management research showed that participants who interrupted ART were at higher risk of developing AIDS and non-AIDS events compared to those who did not interrupt ART, 19 it also revealed that ATI can be done safely when the individual has suppressed plasma viremia (pVL < 50 copies/ml), high current CD4 count (>500 cells/\u03bcl) and high CD4 nadir (>200 cells/\u03bcl), in the context of a carefully monitored trial. 1 20-22 Therefore, participants in the HAVARTI trial will be screened for these inclusion criteria to decrease risks associated with ART interruption in a different context. Furthermore, successful re-initiation of ART and suppression of pVL is a priority, so prospective study participants will not have a history of drug-resistant HIV, treatment-refractory pVL response, or non-adherence to ART. Certain HLA phenotypes have been shown to be protective and prevent viral rebound following ATI 23 and therefore HLA typing should be performed if any controller phenotypes emerge following vedolizumab treatment.",

Primatized anti-\u03b14\u03b27 mAb has Fc-receptor avid Fc-fragment, whereas vedolizumab is a masking antibody, without Fc-receptor avidity. 24 25 Macaques were infused with 50 mg/kg of \u03b14\u03b27 mAb, in this study the highest vedolizumab dose is 300 mg per infusion, about 4 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult. Pharmacokinetic studies in humans showed saturation of peripheral blood lymphocyte target receptors at doses as low as 0.2 mg/kg, 26 with robust saturation at doses of 2 mg/kg. 27 Vedolizumab is shown to be clinically effective for IBD at doses of 0.5mg/kg -2mg/kg, 28 29 with 300mg per infusion being the recommended dose for IBD patients. 9 The half-life of vedolizumab is 18-25.5 days 30 31 versus a half-life of 11.4 days for the \u03b14\u03b27 mAb used in the macaque study, therefore, after initial loading of three doses over 5 weeks, the regular dosing interval is 4 weeks for this study as compared to 3 weeks in the macaque study. Finally, participants will receive 7 infusions of vedolizumab instead of the 8 received by macaques. In the macaque study, pVL suppression was evident by 6 weeks after ATI in all treated animals. Viral rebound occurred within 2 weeks in 5 of 8 animals and was subsequently re-suppressed within 4 weeks. 3 Virologic control was therefore robust throughout the remaining \u03b14\u03b27 mAb treatments and after its discontinuation. The number of necessary infusions is unclear, however data from the macaque model suggests that immunologic control developed early after withdrawal of ART, and that ongoing mAb therapy after viral suppression may not be necessary.",

In the macaque study, 3 of 11 animals developed antibodies against the \u03b14\u03b27 mAb. 3 However, these animals were excluded from analysis and the effect of ADA on HIV treatment efficacy remains uncertain. The GEMINI trials demonstrated a 4% immunogenicity rate for IBD patients who received continuous vedolizumab treatment, with rates of persistent positive antibody and neutralizing antibodies at 0.6% and 2.3%, respectively. 32 33 However, the immunogenicity rate was 10% when patients were off vedolizumab treatment, suggesting the rate may have been underestimated due to decreased ability to detect low to moderate ADA titers during continuous treatment. 10 31 Since ADA development is more likely for low-level and intermittent exposure, this study is designed with short dosing intervals to avoid recurrent prolonged periods of low mAb levels.",

Each group will receive 7 infusions of vedolizumab, at week 0, 2, 5, 8, 12, 26, and 20. Group 1 will be recruited first and receive 300mg of vedolizumab per infusion, the highest licensed dose. Group 2 and Group 3 will receive 150mg and 75 mg per infusion respectively. Screening and Baseline will take place approximately 3-6 months apart. Baseline and Week 0 assessments can take place at one visit or be split into two visits (ie. the Baseline rectal biopsy can take place up to 4 weeks prior to the Week 0 visit (or at the same time) when the vedolizumab intervention is started. Participants will start vedolizumab at the Week 0 visit, but continue on their pre-study ART regimen until week 6/7 (ATI). There will be four doses of vedolizumab after ATI at weeks 8, 12, 16 and 20 (each 4 weeks apart from each other). The participant will subsequently visit every 4 weeks until week 52 as per study visit schedule (Table 1 ).

Primatized anti-\u03b14\u03b27 mAb has Fc-receptor avid Fc-fragment, whereas vedolizumab is a masking antibody, without Fc-receptor avidity. 24 25 Macaques were infused with 50 mg/kg of \u03b14\u03b27 mAb, in this study the highest vedolizumab dose is 300 mg per infusion, about 4 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult. Pharmacokinetic studies in humans showed saturation of peripheral blood lymphocyte target receptors at doses as low as 0.2 mg/kg, 26 with robust saturation at doses of 2 mg/kg. 27 Vedolizumab is shown to be clinically effective for IBD at doses of 0.5mg/kg -2mg/kg, 28 29 with 300mg per infusion being the recommended dose for IBD patients. 9 The half-life of vedolizumab is 18-25.5 days 30 31 versus a half-life of 11.4 days for the \u03b14\u03b27 mAb used in the macaque study, therefore, after initial loading of three doses over 5 weeks, the regular dosing interval is 4 weeks for this study as compared to 3 weeks in the macaque study. Finally, participants will receive 7 infusions of vedolizumab instead of the 8 received by macaques. In the macaque study, pVL suppression was evident by 6 weeks after ATI in all treated animals. Viral rebound occurred within 2 weeks in 5 of 8 animals and was subsequently re-suppressed within 4 weeks. 3 Virologic control was therefore robust throughout the remaining \u03b14\u03b27 mAb treatments and after its discontinuation. The number of necessary infusions is unclear, however data from the macaque model suggests that immunologic control developed early after withdrawal of ART, and that ongoing mAb therapy after viral suppression may not be necessary.",

Macaques were infected with SIV 5 weeks before initiation of ART, 3 Design of the HAVARTI protocol aims to maximally protect study participants from developing anti-drug antibodies (ADA). In the macaque study, 3 of 11 animals developed antibodies against the \u03b14\u03b27 mAb. 3 However, these animals were excluded from analysis and the effect of ADA on HIV treatment efficacy remains uncertain. The GEMINI trials demonstrated a 4% immunogenicity rate for IBD patients who received continuous vedolizumab treatment, with rates of persistent positive antibody and neutralizing antibodies at 0.6% and 2.3%, respectively. 32 suggesting the rate may have been underestimated due to decreased ability to detect low to moderate ADA titers during continuous treatment. 10 31 Since ADA development is more likely for low-level and intermittent exposure, this study is designed with short dosing intervals to avoid recurrent prolonged periods of low mAb levels.",

Group 2 and Group 3 will receive 150mg and 75 mg per infusion respectively. Screening and Baseline will take place approximately 3-6 months apart. Baseline and Week 0 assessments can take place at one visit or be split into two visits (ie. the Baseline rectal biopsy can take place up to 4 weeks prior to the Week 0 visit (or at the same time) when the vedolizumab intervention is started. Participants will start vedolizumab at the Week 0 visit, but continue on their pre-study ART regimen until week 6/7 (ATI). There will be four doses of vedolizumab after ATI at weeks 8, 12, 16 and 20 (each 4 weeks apart from each other). The participant will subsequently visit every 4 weeks until week 52 as per study visit schedule (Table 1 ).

Additionally, an infected lymphocyte may remain dormant with latent, integrated HIV infection, which expands the latent reservoir of infected cells. Continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppressesHIV viremia and allows some degree of immune healing, so as to permit near-normal health and life expectancy.

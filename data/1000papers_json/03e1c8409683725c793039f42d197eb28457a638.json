The 501Y.V1 was firstly isolated in the United Kingdom (UK) (Davies et al., 2020) and featured with 7 substitutions including N501Y as well as 3 deletions in S protein. This variant was identified to increase the viral transmissibility by 56% in comparison with the preexisting strains. Days after this report, another SARS-CoV-2 variant (501Y.V2) featured with N501Y, K417N and E484K substitutions in S protein was supposed to rapidly outcompete the preexisting strains (Tegally et al., 2020) in South Africa. Besides, the 501Y.V3 variant was initially detected in Brazil and has caused rapidly increased infections with SNPs N501Y, K417T and E484K. Of them, N501Y, K417N/T and E484K are of particular interest because the N501Y was shared in all three variants and the K417N/T and E484K were detected simultaneous appeared with N501Y in 501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3.",

Starting from a clinical isolation from COVID-19 patient, serial passaging of the virus in the lung of aged mice led to the emergence of a panel of adaptive mutations including N501Y . Deep sequencing showed that the N501Y mutation has readily been emerged after a single passage in mouse lung, and the proportion of mutation gradually increased during several subsequent passages. Structural modelling suggested the N501Y probably increased the binding affinity to mouse ACE2, which account for the increased mouse infectivity and virulence . With the help of deep mutation, Starrs et al. found N501Y mutation may also enhance the human ACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 (Starr et al., 2020) .",

Notably, this is also in accordance with the appearing order of these two mutations in humans. Viruses with N501Y substitutions has been identified in Brazil at Apr. 7th 2020, in the USA at Apr. 21st, and in the UK at Jun. 8th, while viruses with both N501Y and K417N were initially detected in the early of Oct. 2020.

The bursting of N501Y mutation in Africa and Europe since Sep. related with the observed pandemic caused by 501Y.V1 and 501Y.V2. The D128Y were mainly occurred in Europe and North America. P84S and D128Y always existed in humans (Fig. 1B) .

In total, 4 mutations including T285I in nsp4, K2R in nsp7, E23G in nsp8 and F7S in ORF6 were identified after 10 in-vivo passage. Of the 4 detected mutations, T285I was observed to be appeared in COVID-19 patients, whereas other 3 mutations seem to be only observed in mice. Strikingly, the N501Y mutation was not recorded in this study. The divergence between two passaging studies was probably associated with the starting virus. Virus used in Baric's study was not a wild-type viral strain, but an engineered SARS-CoV-2 strain with Q493K mutation in S protein. Previously, mouse adapted viruses were also reported in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV mouse models (Cockrell et al., 2016; Roberts et al., 2007) . No convergent evolution was detected in human and mouse model of MERS-CoV, which might due to the engineered mouse in this experiment. However, in the mouse model of SARS-CoV that used a clinical SARS-CoV for serial passaging in mice, the only mutation in S protein of MA15 (Y436H) could also be detected in early SARS-CoV strain in human (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004).",

In some specific situations like the ferret farms in Netherlands (Munnink et al., 2020) with relative isolated environments, the mutation Y453F in S protein could be confirmed to be first mutated in animals and then transmitted to humans. However, In most cases, without detailed epidemiological information, animal models cannot be used to explore the original source of virus mutation.",

Traditionally, animal models are useful tools to evaluate viral virulence, pathogenic mechanism and vaccine effectiveness. However, recent animal adaption experiments indicate that mutations observed in isolated adaptive SARS-CoV-2 from infected animals may also provide valuable information for how virus adapts in the transmission of human society. Especially, those mutations in the S protein of native virus adaption may have the convergent substitutions among different hosts, such as mouse, mink or human. Since over 20,000 mutations of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified now and most of them may not have advantage of fitness in viral evolution (Grubaugh et al., 2020) , the adapted mutations from animal models might help to filter the ''noise'' in such a large amount of mutation pool. Learning these warning signs from animals might help respond quickly and prepare well for the emerging viral variants before their widespread transmission in humans. However, it also should be noted that viruses may undergo different mutations in order to adapt to different hosts. To what extent the adapted mutations in animal models to mimic those in humans requires further investigation.",

For the red dots, the size of dots was related with the frequency of each mutations in humans. (B) The spatio-temporal distribution in humans of the viral strains with the six mutations detected both in mice and human collected in GISAID until Jan. 11th 2021. H470Y could be detected in patients in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. L37F could be detected in viruses all over the world. P84S could be identified mainly in Europe and North America.",

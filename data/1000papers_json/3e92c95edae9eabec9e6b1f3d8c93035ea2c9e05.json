The underlying disease process is not altered despite the use of invasive procedures in terminally ill patients, and potential harm or discomfort can occur if invasive procedures are used inappropriately.

Because of the various types of body habitus found in ICU patients, a calculation of the Quetelet body mass index (BMI) is helpful to standardize weight to height, providing a relatively standardized estimate of body fat: BMI = weight (kg)/by height (in m 2 ). In the geriatric population, a BMI less than 20 is predictive of nearly 50% 1-year mortality; indeed, it may be a stronger predictor of mortality than is diagnosis. Similar results have been found among critically ill adults with a BMI less than or equal to the 15th percentile. Such data suggests that the optimal BMI may be higher in the elderly than in the general population.

Signi fi cantly reduced albumin concentration, therefore, should be attributed to disease processes and be aggressively investigated. A substantial decline in serum albumin concentration is accurately predictive of mortality and worse outcome among the elderly. However, the half-life of albumin, 18-19 days, limits the applicability in monitoring acute metabolic and synthetic functions, in which rapid change is signi fi cant. Alternatives to albumin include prealbumin and retinol-binding protein. The former has a half-time of 2 days and is not affected by age but is elevated with steroid use. The latter has a half-time of 12 h, decreases slightly with age, and is elevated in the setting of acute liver injury.

At present, geriatric patients represent between 25 and 50% of all ICU admissions. In 2000, ICU costs represented 13.3% of hospital costs, 4.2% of healthcare expenditures, and 0.56% of the U.S. gross domestic product.

Although the family member's \"do everything for Granddad\" dictum is familiar, it often represents an unrealistic appraisal of the possible bene fi t from certain modalities of care that can be done, but possibly should not be done. Although the ICU is designed as a temporary environment that allows support of body functions during recovery, the complicated technology and meticulous attention to detail that characterizes that environment is not the basis for such \"magical\" accomplishments as saving the life of a patient who has a lethal condition, despite the expectations and exhortations of some. Nonetheless, death can often skillfully be forestalled with polished and professional ICU care to such a degree that it may occur immediately after a de-escalation of such care, or later while the patient is on the general ward, in a step-down unit or rehabilitation facility, or after returning home (either early or late) to a life with varying similarity to that prior to the original serious medical occurrence. Meaningful discussions with elderly patients and their families, whether prior to complex morbid surgical procedures or as an ICU stay extends past the fi rst few days, must include accurate outcome data, so as to facilitate informed decisions regarding the speci fi cs and suitability of continued care. Studies addressing outcome in the critically ill geriatric population have produced various results that vary with the metric employed, the duration over which the outcome is monitored, and broad intrapopulation patient variability. The latter category highlights differences in age, premorbid physical status, statements of preference regarding aggressiveness of long-term medical care, and patient and family declarations addressing such subjective concepts as posthospitalization quality of life. The term outcome must be speci fi cally de fi ned as to the depth of support required by the post-ICU elder and its correspondence with that autonomous person's preferences, which, again, may vary widely, based on cultural, religious, national, and other parameters. Although some elders may prefer a less aggressive care regimen designed around end-of-life comfort at the expense of duration of remaining life, others may desire life extension in the face of critical illness by use of complex technology despite a vanishingly small or nonexistent expectation of recovery. Furthermore, the clinician's perceptions of the patient's desires may not be accurate, and thus may lead to withdrawal of care or withholding of a modality of treatment in a manner that would not be considered in the care of a younger patient. It is important to remember that while age may be associated with worse outcome from critical illness; numerous investigations have demonstrated that age, in and of itself, is less a factor than is the severity of the speci fi c condition that warrants intensive care or the general medical condition of the patient prior to the institution of intensive care. Quality of life (QOL) in the post-ICU elder is not necessarily inferior to that of younger individuals; indeed, overall QOL has been demonstrated to be similarly good across age groups ranging from middle-aged to very old (above 80 years). While years of living bring elderly patients with the most complex illnesses and comorbid conditions to the door of the hospital and intensive care unit, it is to be remembered that the elderly can recover fully, or almost so, from profoundly serious illness despite numerous worrisome impediments that would discourage all but the most optimistic clinician. Although a substantial percentage of the elderly cannot be brought back to an independent level of functioning, every effort should be expended to achieve accurate diagnosis and expeditious treatment, providing full intensive support to conditions that are correctable and recognition when reasonable limits have been reached.

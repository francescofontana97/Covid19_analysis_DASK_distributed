Here, we discuss a patient with severe COVID-19 and a history of type 2 diabetes who had a recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) after recovering. The patient was initially discharged after two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and partially absorbed bilateral lesions on chest computed tomography (CT). However, at his first follow-up, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay with an oropharyngeal swab sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Despite this, he displayed no obvious clinical symptoms and improved chest CT. The patient was prescribed anti-viral medication. Eight consecutive RT-PCR assays on oropharyngeal swab specimens were conducted after he was re-admitted to our hospital. The results tested positive on the 12 th , 14 th , 19 th , 23 rd and 26 th of March and negative on the 28 th of March, and 6 th and 12 th of April. After his second discharge, he has tested negative for 5 weeks. This case highlights the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the follow-up period so that an infectivity assessment can be made.",

However, the serum procalcitonin concentration was normal (less than 0.05 ng/mL). Liver function showed low albumin levels (30.1 g/L, normal range: 35-55 g/L). Renal function indicated low urea nitrogen (1.6 mmol/L, normal range: 2.5-7.5 mmol/L) and creatinine (40.4 mmol/L, normal range: 44.2-88.mmol/L, normal range: 0.6-1.1 mmol/L) levels were lower than normal. His fasting serum glucose (11.14 mmol/L; normal range: 3.89-6.11 mmol/L) and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c 8% (normal range: 0-6 %) were high. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Myocardial enzymes, electrolyte, and coagulation function were normal. The immunoglobulin M (IgM) test for influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza, adenovirus, Epstein Barr virus, mycoplasma, and chlamydia was negative. IgG for mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. After receiving symptomatic treatment and antimicrobial therapy, including recombinant human interferon a2b, arbidol, adenosine monophosphate, cefoperazone sodium and sulbactam sodium and human immunoglobulin, the patient still suffered from an intermittent cough, chills, and fever. Therefore, he was transferred to the Nanhua Hospital of the University of South China. On admission, an arterial blood gas analysis indicated decreased arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) of 55 mmHg and an oxygenation index of 44 mmHg. Symptoms improved after inhalation of interferon-\u03b1, anti-viral treatment (Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets), antibacterial treatment, traditional Chinese medicine, and supportive care.

Routine monitoring for potential ADRs is encouraged by consensus guidelines, particularly as use of investigational and EUA agents continues outside of rigorously monitored clinical trials. 4 Multicenter point prevalence methodology may allow detection of ADR signals on a large scale and is relatively easy to implement rapidly. Although this methodology does not allow investigators to infer causation, it does supply valuable information about the landscape of current practice and may discern effects that otherwise could be missed within a single center. 8, 9 We conducted a multicenter point prevalence study to evaluate the drug therapies used to treat COVID-19 at the onset of the pandemic in the United States. The objective of this point prevalence study was to characterize the drug therapies used in the management of COVID-19, including supportive care and combination therapies, in an attempt to identify safety signals among acutely ill hospitalized patients.",

Each site was asked to select a random sample of up to 30 patients and to complete data collection by May 8, 2020. Any hospitalized patient meeting inclusion criteria was eligible. Data were manually extracted from an electronic health record (EHR) system and entered into a standardized electronic survey form. Assigned study members performed data collection on any singular date that fell within the aforementioned study period. Data extraction from EHR systems was limited to data collected during the 24 hours prior to the index date of review, and no patient identifiers were collected. Study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) electronic data capture tools (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) hosted at Northwestern University. REDCap is a secure, webbased software platform designed to support data capture for research studies. 10 Prevention (CDC), were collected as a frame of reference for the study period.

Clinical trial enrollment status was evaluated through review of notes within the health record. Combination therapy was considered as concurrent receipt of more than 1 agent targeting SARS-CoV-2 (eg, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine plus remdesivir). Data on requirement and degree of oxygen support within the last 24 hours was collected and classified as follows: no oxygen needed, supplemental oxygen required; low-flow oxygen (<6 L) via nasal cannula, high-flow oxygen (\u22656 L) via nasal cannula, or invasive mechanical ventilation.

Pharmacist data collectors were instructed to assess the patients' clinical status on the day of review as they would routinely do as part of daily clinical monitoring; the collected data were thus reflective of a real-world approach to pharmacist-provided clinical monitoring. The information evaluated, which may have varied according to reviewer practice, could include assessment of clinician notes, vital signs, and laboratory values to identify any ADRs and evaluate clinical status. We assessed the presence of new or worsening ADRs occurring concurrently with use of drug therapies for COVID-19 and observed the following reactions within the prior 24 hours: transaminitis (classified as liver enzyme elevations of 3 times or 5 times the upper limit of normal), acute kidney injury (ie, an increase in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/L or 50% 18 ), coagulopathy, headache, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) of >500 milliseconds (ms), new-onset arrhythmia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Severity of ADRs, aside from previously defined toxicity thresholds, was not captured given the study's point prevalence design, which provided only a 24-hour snapshot of the patients' treatment. Worsening clinical status, as documented within a physician's note, and any in-hospital mortality were also evaluated as safety endpoints.",

[14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Patient and facility demographics are summarized and stratified according to receipt of only supportive care vs COVID-19-di rected therapy in Table 1 . Patients were primarily treated at academic medical centers (53.4%), followed by community hospitals (42.6%), and a minority were treated at rehabilitation hospitals (4%). The majority of patients in our study were treated in the Midwest region (81%), with 10 states represented throughout the country. Over 97% of patients were confirmed to have had COVID-19 on the basis of diagnostic testing, with 98% of specimens collected via nasopharyngeal swab and a minority collected via bronchoalveolar lavage. The mean (SD) age of patients was 61.9 (16.1) years. Fifty-two percent of patients were males. The mean (SD) body weight and body mass index (BMI) were 89 (29) kg and 31.8 (11.3) kg/m 2 , respectively. Over 95% of patients were adults, and 4.5% were pediatric or neonatal patients. The majority of patients (81%) had received supportive care only (including supplemental oxygen and/or other nonpharmacological support) at the time of evaluation.",

Supportive care has been suggested as a cautious approach to providing unproven and understudied drug therapy in an emergency situation, 23, 24 and more data are needed to define the safety of COVID-19 drug therapies. Our finding that ADRs were relatively common among patients with COVID-19 receiving drug therapy underscores the need for close monitoring. Among those who had received drug therapy, use of therapeutic agents in COVID-19 was based on institutional prescribing protocols, local guidance, or individual clinician practice. The study protocol was observational and did not call for the use of any specific agents or dosages; however, among the dosages observed, all were consistent with available dosing guidance in preprint and published literature at the time of use, which could be expected to limit the anticipated risk of ADRs. We found that patients who were enrolled in clinical trials were nearly 6-fold more likely to have an ADR detected, likely reflecting the careful monitoring occurring in trials. Reduced face-to-face time between clinicians and patients in an effort to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and conserve personal protective equipment might also contribute to the lower incidence of ADR reporting among patients not enrolled in clinical trials. Unfortunately, the vast majority of patients with COVID-19 do not have access to clinical trials but receive these agents nonetheless. Therefore, there is a clear need for improved ADR monitoring in patients receiving unproven therapies.",

While some drugs have been touted as efficacious, clinical trial findings have not mirrored these claims, and many of these potential treatments have been plagued by safety concerns.

Recently, results of a multinational registry analysis of over 96,000 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were treated with hydroxychloroquine (n = 3,016), hydroxychloroquine plus a macrolide (n = 6,221), chloroquine (n = 1,868), or chloroquine plus a macrolide (n = 3,783) were reported. 27 The investigators observed an increased risk of in-hospital mortality and de novo ventricular arrhythmias with use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquinebased therapy, though these results have been called into question, 28 resulting in retraction of the paper. Subsequently, the World Health Organization discontinued enrollment for a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine, as the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 therapy appears to be futile. 29 Whereas the aforementioned agents have known limitations, other agents such as IL-6 antagonists (tocilizumab and sarilumab), IL-1 antagonists (anakinra and canakinumab), and remdesivir are gaining increased attention. Use of the IL-6 antagonist tocilizumab appeared to be beneficial in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19, with reported improvements in oxygen requirements, fever resolution, lung imaging, and inflammatory markers. 30 Unfortunately, these benefits have not been reproduced in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. 31 Similarly, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of sarilumab was stopped in light of study results demonstrating no significant clinical benefit and a potential risk of adverse events. 32 As depicted in these studies, off-label and investigational drug therapy targeting the cytokine response may increase the risk of secondary infections, gastrointestinal perforations, and hepatic toxicity. 33 As the full results of these studies become available, clinicians will benefit from a greater understanding of the risk of ADRs among patients receiving treatment for COVID-19.",

Serious adverse events occurred in 18% and 26% of patients receiving remdesivir and placebo, respectively. The ACTT-1 trial was a randomized, placebocontrolled study of 1,063 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 15 Preliminary results showed a shorter median time to recovery with remdesivir therapy (11 days vs 15 days). Serious adverse events occurred in 21% and 27% of patients receiving remdesivir and placebo, respectively. ADRs occurring more often with remdesivir were decreased renal function, pyrexia, and hyperglycemia. 15 The Gilead-sponsored SIMPLE trial comparing 5 and 10 days of remdesivir did not identify a primary efficacy difference for the regimens evaluated; however, significantly more patients treated for 10 days experienced any serious adverse event, including AKI. 35 We did not identify higher rates of ADRs with use of remdesivir in our study, but patients could have been receiving remdesivir under compassionate use criteria or may have been placebo recipients in the setting of a clinical trial. Based upon available evidence, patients receiving remdesivir, particularly for more than 5 days, will require more intensive monitoring. According to available COVID-19 literature, rates of reported ADRs are relatively high, ranging from 18% to 27%, a range that exceeds the rate of observed ADRs in our study, likely due to infrequent remdesivir use among included patients. 34, 35 Our study had a number of limitations. First, it was a point prevalence survey and thus cause-and-effect relationships could not be discerned. Our survey data window was limited to the prior 24 hours, so it is likely that our evaluation of adverse effects was conservative. Because our ability to discern causation was limited, it is not completely clear to what extent the adverse events we found were related to COVID-19 sequelae vs drug therapies. Nevertheless, we observed numerically more adverse reactions among patients who did not require supplemental oxygen. These patients were at various points of their disease course (ie, we included anyone who was hospitalized and required treatment), so prior exposure to agents that may have led to the noted adverse effects (eg, diarrhea due to use of antibiotics) was not comprehensively assessed. Additionally, patients with less severe illness may have been able to communicate ADRs more effectively to clinicians. Our sample size was somewhat small because drug therapy was not as common early in the pandemic. Finally, as our study was conducted before drug therapy became more common, our assessment of ADRs associated with drug therapy may be conservative. More work is needed to define the time course and severity of ADRs in this population in order to improve patient safety.",

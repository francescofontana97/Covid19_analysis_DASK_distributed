This study aimed to (i) explore perceived susceptibility and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) examine the practice of nonpharmaceutical interventions, and (iii) assess the potential association of perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with the practice of nonpharmaceutical interventions among people living in Afghanistan. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used, using online surveys disseminated from April to May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to recruit the participants of this study. The previously developed scales were used to assess the participants' demographic information, perceived risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and perceived severity of COVID-19. Multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the potential association of perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with the practice of nonpharmaceutical interventions. Results: The Internet was the main source for obtaining COVID-19 information among participants in this study. While 45.8% of the participants believed it was \"very unlikely\" for them to get infected with COVID-19, 76.7% perceived COVID-19 as a severe disease. Similarly, 37.5% believed the chance of being cured if infected with COVID-19 is \"unlikely/very unlikely.\" The majority of participants (95.6%) perceived their health to be in \"good\" and \"very good\" status. Overall, 74.2% mentioned that they stopped visiting public places, 49.7% started using gloves, and 70.4% started wearing a mask. Participants who believed they have a low probability of survival if infected with COVID-19 were more likely to wear masks and practice hand washing.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a severe toll on the health and well-being of people globally. 1 Studies have shown that human behaviors are more likely to influence the risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 2 While drugs and vaccines have been developed and administered to reduce the severity of COVID-19, their effectiveness to fully contain COVID-19 outbreaks is still unclear. Therefore, nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs), such as the use of masks, regular hand washing, and maintaining social distancing are mandatory, and these preventive measures have been encouraged by both authorities and health-care providers to limit the spread of the disease. 3, 4 According to the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), 5 perceived susceptibility and perceived severity are key factors in alleviating the global threat of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, 6 because populations who perceive themselves at a higher risk of having health problems are more likely to engage in preventive behaviors. However, adequate and appropriate information is needed to understand specific situations and follow the precautions effectively. In this age of science and technology, risk perception toward COVID-19 can be heavily influenced by social media narratives and multiple information technology sources. 7 For example, the overuse of mass media and social network services in communicating the fear of COVID-19 might contribute to overreaction, unwarranted public fear, and an overly pessimistic perception of the current risk. 8 Therefore, a timely assessment of the psychological and behavioral responses of the community is critical to developing subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses. 9 For developing countries like Afghanistan, with a fragile healthcare system, the impact of the novel COVID-19 goes far beyond the capacity of the country. The first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Afghanistan was a 35-y-old man identified on February 24, 2020, in Herat, the third-largest city located in the western part of the country. 10 Despite timely initiation and implementation of containment/precautionary measures and active surveillance (when the country had a relatively low caseload of 50), the number of cases grew rapidly. As of April 1, 2021, there were 56,517, cases and 2489 deaths confirmed in Afghanistan. 11 Although containment measures were initiated asking people to stay at home, this was not feasible for many people with financial constraints. Furthermore, unlike other high-income countries, the Government of Afghanistan was not able to provide financial assistance, leaving people with no choice but to work. 12 In the long run, this arguably applies to all countries irrespective of their income status. Therefore, as mentioned above, it is crucial to be informed about the severity of the disease and strictly follow preventive measures to curb the spread of the virus. This study aimed to (i) explore perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of the COVID-19 pandemic (ii) examine the practice of nonpharmaceutical interventions, and (iii) assess the potential association of perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with the practice of nonpharmaceutical interventions among people living in Afghanistan.",

Believing to have a low likelihood to be cured from COVID-19 was not statistically significantly associated with any of the outcomes. Unexpectedly, the AOR of avoiding public places was 0.53 (95%CI 0.29-0.97) for responders who self-identified as being highly likely of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Because of the cross-sectional design, it is possible that this finding was driven by reverse causality: people who reported having a higher probability of infection were those who could not avoid public places. Responders with perceived high susceptibility to infection of their family had AOR 3.60 (1.86-6.99) of practicing hand washing. Also, responders who believed to have a low probability of surviving if they fell ill with COVID-19 had AOR 1.87 (1.02-3.41) of wearing a mask, and AOR 2.01 (1.08-3.73) of practicing hand washing.

It could be possible that the confidence of the participants in their preventive measures might have lowered their perceived risk of infection. Moreover, the government had implemented strict containment measures, such as universities and school suspension, Nowruz restriction (Persian new year that is originally celebrated in Balkh), travel bans, the shutdown of restaurants and all entertainment/recreational facilities, and active surveillance (self-isolation and quarantine, strict confirmed case monitoring, case isolation). 12 These containment measures might have provided them with a sense of security. More importantly, the majority of the participants in our study had comparatively higher schooling levels than the general population in Afghanistan. Educated people are more likely to follow precautionary measures and stay up to date with the epidemiological situation.",

Although the Afghan government implemented diverse containment measures and active surveillance for COVID-19, this study did not specifically consider those measures as a probable variable affecting the outcome. Notably, measures taken by the government forced people to follow the rules in many countries. For example, in China, the use of face masks was widely practiced because of strict government rules. 21 However, in the United Kingdom, despite the government's recommendation to implement social distancing, people were reluctant to comply due to low perceived disease severity and susceptibility. 17 Therefore, efforts should be made by individuals, as well as by the government, to mitigate the effect of a virus.",

This finding is similar to the one from the study conducted by Cinelli et al. where social media, such as Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, and Gab, were used mostly by participants to receive information about COVID-19. 22 Considering their wide use, the government of Afghanistan could use these platforms to educate people about the risk of the disease and use them for critical planning of COVID-19 control measures. However, while promoting the use of the Internet, major attention should be given to the credibility of the information sources and people Table 5 . Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness must be informed as to how to use those media wisely. 23 News circulated about rural community people who tried using antibiotics, while urban people denied having symptoms due to the fear and stigma surrounding the disease. Therefore, proper education should be provided to the local community people. 24, 25 Furthermore, the spread of COVID-19 in Afghanistan is complicated by a diverse set of problems, including the influx of Afghani refugees who continue to return from Iran due to Iran's deadly coronavirus outbreak and subsequent economic stagnation. 12 Another concern is the low public awareness of COVID-19 and low health literacy. Indeed, cultural norms like hugging, community gatherings in religious places are still allowed. Aiming for containment may not be possible for low-income countries like Afghanistan, which cannot provide incentives for the people. The diagnostic kits shortage, lack of local laboratories, and lack of health-care workers in rural areas are other concerns. Only 9.4 skilled health-care workers and 1.9 physicians are available per 10,000 population. Due to the scarcity of doctors at the national level, health-care workers are disproportionately distributed across the country with 7.2 physicians per 10, 000 in urban areas and 0.6 in rural areas, causing considerable delays in delivering essential health interventions. 12 While there are numerous problems (associated with health-care delivery, political instability, potential disaster, and economic hardship), 26 multiple international organizations have been providing support to mitigate the problems associated with COVID-19. 27 Policy-makers should work efficiently to deal with the crisis by training health workers, mobilizing them effectively, establishing laboratories, and providing essential equipment/supplies to expand testing across the country. Most importantly, the strategic vision for risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) 24 that has been developed should be properly implemented to improve the health-care delivery system of the country.",

Moreover, we used an online survey, which might have limited the participation from older and disadvantaged groups of the population. However, although Internet users were estimated to be comparatively few, use of the Internet is an increasing trend. 30 Second, there might have been overreporting of preventive measures, as we did not use any scale to measure the authenticity of their response.

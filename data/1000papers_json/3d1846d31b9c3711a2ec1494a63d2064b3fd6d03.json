In this study, we focused on dendritic cells (DCs) which play important roles in linking the innate and adaptive immunity. SARS-CoV was shown to infect both immature and mature human monocyte-derived DCs by electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. The detection of negative strands of SARS-CoV RNA in DCs suggested viral replication. However, no increase in viral RNA was ob-served. Using cytopathic assays, no increase in virus titer was detected in infected DCs and cell-culture supernatant, confirming that virus replication was incomplete. No induction of apoptosis or maturation was detected in SARS-CoVinfected DCs. The SARS-CoV-infected DCs showed low expression of antiviral cytokines (interferon \u2423 [IFN-\u2423], IFN-\u2424, IFN-\u2425, and interleukin 12p40 [IL-12p40]), moderate up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u2423 [TNF-\u2423] and IL-6) but significant upregulation of inflammatory chemokines (macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u2423 [MIP-1\u2423], regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted [RANTES]), interferon-inducible protein of 10 kDa [IP-10], and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1]). The lack of antiviral cytokine response against a background of intense chemokine upregulation could represent a mechanism of immune evasion by SARS-CoV.",

The novel SARS-CoV, however, caused severe, rapidly progressive atypical pneumonia with fever, myalgia, and diarrhea. 2, 3 The detection of virus in stool and urine in addition to the respiratory tract of patients with SARS further suggested that SARS is a systemic disease. 4, 5 At autopsy, white pulp atrophy was observed in the spleen, and there was lymphoid depletion in lymph nodes. [6] [7] [8] Together with lymphopenia and increasing viral load in the first 10 days of disease, 3, 4, 6 these clinical features strongly suggest an evasion of the immune system by SARS-CoV. As with other viral infections, such as measles, this lymphoid depletion may have pathogenic significance.",

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells that play key roles in linking innate and adaptive immunity. [9] [10] [11] Immature DCs reside in the respiratory tract for immune surveillance, and they respond dynamically to local tissue inflammation in the airways and the distal lung. 12, 13 They express a wide range of receptors, including c-type lectins 14, 15 and toll-like receptors, 16, 17 for the recognition of conserved pathogen patterns. Dendritic cells signal the presence of danger to cells of the adaptive immune response and modulate their responses via the secretion of proinflammatory and/or antiviral cytokines. 18 In particular, DCs secrete cytokines to polarize T-helper (Th) cells toward the Th1 or Th2 subsets. 10 The migration of DCs from tissues to lymph nodes is essential for antigen presentation and triggering of adaptive immune responses. The trafficking of DCs is regulated by chemokines that can be classified as homeostatic (constitutively expressed) or inflammatory (induced/augmented) according to their immune fuctions. [19] [20] [21] Acute respiratory viruses commonly induce inflammatory chemokines, such as macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u2423 (MIP-1\u2423), regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), interferon-inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10), and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), in local tissues. 21 Dendritic cells are also a major source of these chemokines. 20 On the basis of the function of DCs in immune surveillance, priming, and tolerance, we hypothesized that DCs play an important role in the immunopathology of SARS. In addition, the developmental status of the host immune cells may affect their responses to viral infection. Hence, we also compared the cytokine and chemokine gene expression in SARS-CoV-infected adult and cord blood (CB) DCs. This study provides evidence that SARS-CoV can infect DCs and alter their cytokines/chemokines production. Our results suggest possible mechanisms of immune escape and amplification of immunopathology in SARS.",

            "text": "Viruses enhance their own survival by interfering with normal innate immune responses of the host. Usually, type 1 interferons are effectively generated in response to viral infection and keep activated T cells alive. 45 However, very low level of interferon gene expression was observed in SARS-CoV-infected DCs ( Figure 6 ). In general, double-stranded RNA, when bound to toll-like receptor 3, triggers the production of interferons in DCs. 46 The lack of activation of interferon production by SARS-CoV may involve mechanisms that interferes with downstream signaling molecules such as IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), TRIF (TIR [Toll/IL-1 receptor] domain-containing adapter inducing IFN), and putative kinases or proteases. 47 Because DCs and interferons both play a role in the generation of antibody responses, 48 the lack of interferon induction in DCs may contribute to the slow antibody production and progressive increase of viral load over the first 10 days of SARS observed clinically. 4 Interestingly, SARS-CoV-infected CB DCs expressed slightly higher levels of interferon genes than adult DCs. Further investigation is needed to determine whether this observation is relevant to the less-severe disease presentation observed in pediatric SARS. Interleukin 12 is the main cytokine secreted by DCs that regulates the differentiation of CD4 \u03e9 T cells into Th1 cells and serves important function in cell-mediated immunity. 49 Similar to the observation in measles virus-infected DCs, 42 the lack of IL-12 production in SARS-CoV-infected DCs might suppress Th1 and favor Th2 responses. Furthermore, the immune escape mechanism operated in HIV 14, 15 and dengue virus 50 via DC-SIGN leading to suppressed IL-12 production may also be implicated in SARS.",

In this study, we also observed significant up-regulation of representative inflammatory chemokines in SARS-CoV-infected DCs (Figure 8 ). MIP-1\u2423, RANTES, IP-10, and MCP-1 are CXC chemokines without the ELR (glutamic acid-leucine-arginine) motif. They preferentially act on mononuclear cells, and their up-regulation has been detected in influenza A virus infection. 57 These chemokines may be responsible for the recruitment and adhesion of inflammatory cells and the migration of leukocytes into the tissue. 57 Our findings will need to be substantiated by in vivo experiments.",

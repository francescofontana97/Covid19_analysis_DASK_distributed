            "text": "On global scale, the current situation of pandemic is symptomatic of increased incidences of 20 contagious diseases caused by pathogens. The faster spread of these diseases, in a moderately 21 short timeframe, is threatening the overall population wellbeing and conceivably the economy. 22 The inadequacy of conventional diagnostic tools in terms of time consuming and complex 23 laboratory-based diagnosis process is a major challenge to medical care. In present era, the 24 development of point-of-care testing (POCT) is in demand for fast detection of infectious diseases 25 along with \"on-site\" results that are helpful in timely and early action for better treatment. In 26 addition, POCT devices also play a crucial role in preventing the transmission of infectious diseases 27 by offering real-time testing and lab quality microbial diagnosis within minutes. Timely diagnosis 28 and further treatment optimization facilitate the containment of outbreaks of infectious diseases. 29 Presently, efforts are being made to support such POCT by the technological development in the 30 field of internet of medical things (IoMT). The IoMT offers wireless-based operation and 31 connectivity of POCT devices with health expert and medical centre. In this review, the recently 32 developed POC diagnostics integrated or future possibilities of integration with IoMT are discussed 33 with focus on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases like malaria, dengue fever, influenza A 34 (H1N1), human papilloma virus (HPV), Ebola virus disease (EVD), Zika virus (ZIKV), and coronavirus 35 (COVID-19). The IoMT-assisted POCT systems are capable enough to fill the gap between 36 bioinformatics generation, big rapid analytics, and clinical validation. An optimized IoMT-assisted 37 POCT will be useful in understanding the diseases progression, treatment decision, and evaluation 38 of efficacy of prescribed therapy. 39 40 41 medical things, Point-of-care-testing. 42 43 44 45 46 47 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

            "text": "Typical disease biomarkers include aptamer, antibodies, whole pathogen (e.g., bacteria and 158 viruses), and the molecular agents (e.g., nucleic acids and proteins) from the infectious agents. 159 Readily available conventional methods like microscopy and culturing are well established and 160 considered effective diagnostic for infectious diseases (Srivastava et al., 2018) . However, these 161 approaches face various challenges during viral markers detection such as i) low sensitivity in 162 microscopy methods and ii) need of highly skilled personnel and techniques in cell culturing to 163 carry out the reliable tests. Moreover, these conventional diagnostics also require more time for 164 clinical interpretations due to cultivation and drug susceptibility testing. Further, molecular 165 methods have increased laboratories throughput due to their higher sensitivity and ability to 166 detect infections faster than the conventional approaches (Lee et al., 2015) . Among these 167 molecular methods, nucleic acid amplification (NAA) assays, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay 168 (ELISA), colorimetric assay and other advance biotechnological methods are becoming more 169 famous and are routinely conducted in many clinical microbiology laboratories. However, these 170 healthcare techniques have several limitations such as too expensive for routine clinical diagnosis, 171 time-consuming (in terms of several hours or days to complete), and labour-intensive. The 172 continuous evolution of automated diagnostic tools like proteome chips, microfluidic, colorimetric 173 assay, and other advance molecular methods allows diagnosis from laboratory to bedside and 174 even recommended by the world health organization (WHO) for use in emergency and remote 175 settings. The selection of an appropriate diagnostic technique relies on the several parameters like 176 sensitivity, selectivity, cost, required time for diagnosis, and availability of the diagnostic tools. The 177 rapid diagnostic procedures can help in more efficient management of transmission of infectious 178 disease in an economic and reliable manner. 7 well in a portable manner. Recent advancement in technology has facilitated development efforts 229 toward portable and wearable POCT frameworks. Uptake of versatile and wearable gadgets 230 (smartphones, drones, and Bluetooth) transformed the entire POC system. Smart electronic 231 devices also allow real-time communication between patient and the health experts that ensure 232 effective diagnostic performance for healthcare management even in resource-limited settings 233 (Jin et al., 2020) . These attributes make POC diagnostics ideal for use as a rapid diagnostic device 234 for infectious diseases (refer to Fig. 4 ) management via detecting a marker and monitoring viral 235 infection progression. 236 237 In case of inaccessibility due to lacking availability and affordability of commercial diagnostic tests, 238 POC tests can sufficiently be utilized according to the accessibility of patients, even at home. Such diagnostics. Resolution of cell-phone camera lens can be effectively used for optical microscopy, 270 flow cytometry, and other imaging readouts for better real-time results (Nayak et al., 2017) . 271 Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology-equipped POCs manifest data connectivity up to few feet 272 such as non-invasive mouthguard biosensor for salivary glucose and fitness trackers, to 273 continuously monitor patient's physical activity and vital signs. (Christodouleas et al., 2018) . 274 Research efforts are directed towards development of smart fabrics having sensing capabilities to 275 record blood pressure, electrocardiogram, heart rate, and body temperature. In 2020, a huge 276 number of internet-connected devices are available in market like medical kiosks, fitness tracking 277 devices (wrist band, smart watches, shorts etc), clinical grade wearables (smart belts, chest strap), 278 remote patient monitoring devices, smart pills, and many more (Ding et al., 2019) . Several non- 279 invasive samples like sweat, saliva, faeces, tears, and breath could be used in eHealth diagnostic 280 devices (eDiagnostics) to detect biomarkers of major diseases (viral infections, cancer, and HIV); 281 however, these devices are still in developing phase as the pathological level of these biomarkers 282 yet not established. At eHealth systems, several diagnostic needs could be covered by eDiagnostic 283 wearable devices. Interestingly, smartphones ubiquity is widely adopted among modest and low- 284 income peoples, promoting the use of POCT without additional costs. It will also increase medical 285 facilities in remote areas and rural communities at lesser costs. 286 287 Major motivation leading to rapid adoption of smartphone-based computing devices in health 288 system is the need of better communication, information resources, and social networking at the 289 POC (Lee Ventola, 2014) . Web browser gives interface for sending and receiving health 290 information with no time delay. In addition, IoMT device also offers other advantageous features, 291 like short message service, e-mail, global positioning systems (GPS), and interactive voice 292 recordings that can help towards automation of POC diagnostics in data collection and further 293 continuous transmission into a central database through satellite networks (Nayak et al., 2017 Meagher & group employed smartphone-based device for high performance diagnostics. They for infectious diseases need sample collection and preparation that limit biosensors capability 1159 from qualifying as POCT. Besides, reagents sometimes need refrigeration for long shelf-life forms 1160 that is another barrier for POC testing. Therefore, researchers start utilizing microfluidic platforms 1161 that carry out all the required operational step but, in a cost-prohibitive bulky setup. protocols and health data, and bioinformatics has emerged as a very serious concern. To secure 1261 the healthcare system from vulnerability exploitation, several options have been explored, e.g., 1262 blockchain-based IoT environment (Moin et al., 2019) . 1263 Expected economic revenues from capital investment in the designing, production, and marketing 1264 of novel POC for use in tropical developing countries are unattractive. Mostly, governmental 1265 organizations have financially supported commercial endeavors and research organization 1266 working on novel biosensor point of care technologies. Additional efforts for wider promotion of 1267 rapid diagnostic tests are expected from international public health organizations. Therefore, it is 1268 much more challenging to deal with barriers and develop a market for POCT assay supported by AI 1269 and IoMT (Fig. 16) In the coming years, widespread advancement of these bioanalytic tools is 1270 expected. This will ultimately be revolutionizing the world of clinical diagnostics to ease the 1271 disease burden in remote areas and even low-income countries. Synergetic approaches involving IoMT and POCT based biosensing system is an interdisciplinary 1280 research that cover wide expertise of various fields to offer benefits to a wide range of 1281 communities including microbiology, immunology, pathology, clinical biology, electronics, material 1282 chemistry, and other applied field of sciences. Presently, the research efforts are focused on 1283 exploration of novel and smart biosensing technology using novel nano-systems, bio-actives, 1284 computational analytics, and hardware integration to achieve easy operation and performance 1285 assessment that are required for timely therapy decision. Therefore, this article served as an 1286 appeal to a wide range of stakeholders including scientists, clinical practitioners, engineers, 1287 medical professionals, industrialists, educators, and students devoted to the development of 1288 affordable IoMT-assisted POCT biosensing system for intelligent healthcare to serve the humanity 1289 in a better way.",

It is widely accepted that design of risk-reduction policies and 241 primary prevention at initial stage of spread of any infectious disease can reduce the incidence 242 rate, disease burden, and improve the health management. Therefore, POCT platforms have 243 significant potential to impact medical care in challenging time of pandemics via rapid results, 244 multimode sensing, easy to use, and home care helps (\"Global Point-of-Care Diagnostics Market 245 Outlook 2020,\" 2020).

(Choi et al., 2016; Ragavan et al.al. designed field deployable standalone LAMP-based molecular diagnostic system 383 (AnyMDx) for real time monitoring of target parasite DNA (Choi et al., 2016). Here, microfluidic 384 discs, preloaded with reaction mixture, were integrated with the small footprint analysers. 385 Malpartida-Cardenas et al. demonstrated LAMP-based fully electronic device for real-time 386 detection of malarial parasite (Malpartida-Cardenas et al., 2019). This lab-on-chip (LOC) platform 387 utilized ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) sensing technique. Apart from this, LAMP 388 amplification technique also explored to design lateral flow device, offering a straightforward 389 endpoint assessment (Hartmeyer et al., 2019). Besides this, instrument-free detection can be 390 easily performed in rural areas to avoid expensive molecular biology equipment e.g., paper-based 391 microfluidics (Reboud et al., 2019). Further, Kumar et al. conducted successful field evaluation of 392 battery-operated magneto-optical malaria diagnostic device (Kumar et al., 2020). In comparison to 393 detection of P. falciparum histidine rich protein-2 (Pfhrp2), this device was based on detection of 394 hemozoin (by-product of HB) due to its prevalent nature in resistant parasites. Most of the existing 395 diagnostics detect HRP-2/PfLDH malarial antigens specific for P. falciparum. However, P. vivax (Pv) 396 diagnosis is challenging due to low parasitaemia in blood. In a recently developed electrochemical 397 POCT device based on \"Tri-inlet\" strategies, Pv-avid antibody (MSP1) was integrated to rGO-gold 398 nanocomposite electrode (Singh et al., 2021).

Another LAMP-based POCT was designed using paper and microfluidic control platform 460 against ZIKV, DENV, and chikungunya virus, combinedly (Seok et al., 2020). Whole amplification 461 process was carried out on all-in-one 3D paper chip (engineered properly to have both lateral and 462 vertical flow) using dried reagents. The proposed bioassay platform was able to detect 5-5000 463 copies of viral RNA in human serum within one hour. Recently, microfluidic paper-based POCT 464 based on sandwich immunoassay was fabricated for detection of dengue NS1 (Prabowo et al., 465 2020). The results were visible to the naked eye, while intensity of signal was analysed A) Illustration of non-optical multiplex PCR system (consisting a washing buffer 469 component, microfluidic platform, and a paper based nucleic acid sensor) developed for DENV 470 diagnostics. B) an integrated QCM and electrochemical sensing based DENV diagnostics system.Early diagnosis is important for both patient management and to differentiate infections with 473 similar symptoms, such as malaria, chikungunya, and ZIKV. Many RT-PCR-based POC diagnostics 474 have been reported to detect viral RNA; but molecular diagnostic tests for DENV in field settings 475 are still underdeveloped. Yanow et al validated a RT-PCR POCT to detect DENV directly from 476 plasma samples without RNA extraction (Mehta et al., 2019). The assay was able to differentiate 477 between serotypes of DENV effectively, and do not cross-react with pathogens like dengue478 infection. Recently, Chang & group validate non-optical RT-PCR chip for selective detection of all 479 DENV serotypes (Z. Yin et al., 2020). The diagnostic platform (Fig. 7A) utilized ion-selective 480 membrane sensor to quantify the amplification of a template DNA in real time. Here, sensing 481 modules are functionalized with specific oligoprobes that produce shift in ionic current upon 482 target selection. The key attributes of current technology include insensitiveness to variation in pH 483 and ionic strength as well as elimination of non-specific binding. Here, primer dimerization is 484 considered as a major barrier in the current electrochemical sensor arrays. The rapid detection (90 485 min), low resource setting, and sensitivity favours scalability of the platform. In addition to 486 aptamers, chemically-modified peptides are also known to be used as molecular receptor in 487 electrochemical biosensor (J. H. Kim et al., 2019). 488 489 In a recent study, gold electrode chemically functionalized with synthesized peptides used for the 490 detection of dengue virus NS1 via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and square wave 491 voltammetry (SWV). The developed sensor showed good specificity against all four dengue 492 serotypes and low LOD up to 1.49 \u03bcg/mL in spiked culture broth. Moreover, POCT devices 493 detected the presence of several infectious agents within a specimen. Recent report validated 494 new analytical device for screening of multiple infectious agents in a single sample within a single 495 PCR reactor chip. The recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) is a new isothermal methodology 496 that progresses in the range of 35-45 \u00b0C. The RAA assay exploits four enzymes: recombinase UvsX 497 & UvsY, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), and a DNA polymerase to initiate DNA 498 synthesis. Xiong et al. developed reverse transcription (RT)-recombinase-aided amplification 499 (RAA)-based lateral-flow dipstick (LFD) POCT for the early detection of DENV RNA (Xiong et al., 500 2020). The excellent sensitivity of assay offered reliable detection of dengue virus in resourcemicrobalance (QCM) is extremely sensitive towards mass changes on the surface of 504 sensor. Deposition of analytes onto the surface causes damping effects that lead to shifts in 505 oscillation frequency, generating output signal in terms of alternating current (AC) through the 506 piezoelectric quartz substrate. The integration of QCM (Fig. 7B) and electrochemical measurement 507 on the same crystal has recently been proposed as a promising avenue for early detection of 508 dengue fever (Zainuddin et al., 2020, 2019). Integrated devices have dual-measurement 509 capabilities (mass and impedance), allowing extremely low detection limit up to 10 ng mL -1 of 510 DENV NS1 protein in serum sample. During epidemics, differentiating uncomplicated dengue fever 511 from severe form of the disease needs intensive care for proper clinical management. 512 Interestingly, thrombocytopenia (\"drop\" in platelet level) is strongly correlated with severity of 513 DENV infection in patients. In this matter, POCT devices detecting platelet aggregation has been 514 developed. Multiplate\u2122 multiple-electrode biosensor potential was evaluated for platelet 515 aggregation (De Jong et al., 2020). Platelets become adhesive upon activation with reagents and 516 got deposited onto the metal sensor wires that led to increase in electrical resistance. POC Device 517 potentially provide additional decision-making benefit on the length of hospital stay according to 518 severity of disease. Zhu et al. developed portable IoT integrated miniaturized PCR device (having a 519 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f weight of ~170 g) for detection of DENV based on amplification of cDNA or RNA (Zhu et al., 2020). 520 The results of the PCR device were further uploaded to an Android wireless tool (such as a tablet 521 or smartphone) via a bluetooth interface. From the Android-based smartphone, the results were 522 further sent to global network to ensure the availability of test results anywhere in the world. 523 Such tools can help in mapping of spread of disease with the GPS information which is with segmented RNA produces a haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) 528 glycoproteins, contributing to disease transmission. Based on different antigenic epitopes, virus 529 can be classified into 15 HA and 9 NA serotypes, respectively (Qiu et al., 2017). Among all, H1N1 530 and H3N2 are more virulent and prevalent serotypes causing severe pandemics. In particular, 531 emergence of swine flu from novel influenza strain (S-OIV) H1N1, marked the first global 532 pandemic of 21 st century (Ginsberg et al., 2009). It is an infectious respiratory disease spread to all 533 continent as reported by WHO. According to a report of National Centre for Disease Control 534 (NCDC), a total of 29,930 with 1236 swine flu death cases were reported in India (Ravina et al., 535 2020). Symptoms of Swine flu are different from seasonal influenza like high grade fever for more 536 than three days, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, headache, coughing, and sore throat (Fig. A) Illustration of integrated self-driven microfluidic system to detect H1N1 virus based on 542 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (Y. D. Ma et al., 2019). B) presentation 543 of a self-enzyme chemiluminescence based immunoassay for rapid detection of H1N1 virus (Kyme et 544 al., 2019). C) A dual channel glycin functionalized FET based biosensor developed for selective 545 identification of pandemic influenza viral particles (Hideshima et al., 2019). 546 547 With advancements in POCs, an electricity free one-step nucleic acid dipstick assay with a 548 microfluidic reactor is adopted to design POC against H1N1 virus. The device helps to detect the 549 amplification products with the naked eye (Qiu et al., 2017). Lee et al. proposed a portable setup 550 for the H1N1 virus detection via combined effects of quantum dot (Q dot)-aptamer conjugates and 551 light guide in3D photonic crystals (PC) for signal enhancement (Lee et al., 2018). Such technologies allow end users to collect sensitive data without waiting for long time. recently self-driven microfluidic chip-based POCT (Fig. 8A) was developed for influenza 559 (Y. D. Ma et al., 2019). Here, reaction substituents were transferred through capillary action for 560 LAMP amplification, and the results were analysed by hydroxy naphthol blue (HNB) colorimetric 561 assay (Fig. 8B). Another example of biosensor-based POCT was demonstrated by Hannah et al. Kyme et al., 2019). Hemagglutinin (HA) specific antibodies were immobilized on nanoconjugate Au-Fe 3 O 4 ), and another glycoprotein NA was utilized as self-enzyme, producing 564 chemiluminescence with fluorogenic substrate. Another study reported the detection of H1N1 HA 565 in nanomolar concentration using Fab-type Quench body (fluorophore-labelled antibody) (Jeong 566 et al., 2018). Basically, internal Trp residues of antibody molecules are responsible for quenching 567 while the binding reaction leads to fluorescence of dye. 568 569 Rapid antibody-based assay was extensively used for diagnosis of pandemic H1N1 virus; but the 570 availability of specific antibodies for emerging infectious diseases is time consuming. In view of 571 this, Hai et al. (2017) used poly (3,4-ethylenethiophene (EDOT)) (PEDOT) conducting polymer-572 modified QCM crystal for grafting a biosensor (Hai et al., 2017). These sensing elements were 573 further activated with H1N1 specific 2,6-sialyllactose ligand. The biosensor allowed label-free 574 monitoring of H1N1 viruses upto a detection limit of 0.12 HAU by QCM and potentiometry. In 575 another work, a label-free field effect transistor (FET, Fig. 8C) biosensor was designed for the rapid 576 identification of avian influenza virus (IFV) in biological fluids (Hideshima et al., 2019). Sialylated 577 glycan, particularly prominent on human epithelial cells, was found to mediate influenza viral 578 infection. Hereafter, sialic-acid-containing glycans functionalized electrochemical sensor was 579 designed to recognise human H1N1 virus directly in nasal mucus. In addition, POCT was provided 580 with smartphone to provide user interface for sharing sensing data in order to discover pandemic 581 influenza infection at the early stages of an outbreak. Another ion sensitive FET based biosensor 582 for the detection of H1N1 was fabricated using microfabrication technique by Lee & group (Park et 583 al., 2019). Highly sensitive silicon nanonet FET device was modified with biological receptor 584 molecule (monoclonal antibody) for the quantification of H1N1 virus. The BioFETs POCT showed 585 excellent signal response within the range of 10 pg/ml-100 ng/ml viral load at room temperature. 586 In addition to high specificity to H1N1 by the nanonet sensor, negligible false positive results were 587 also reported for influenza B virus. 588 589 Recently, a genosensor employing immobilized HA gene-specific oligoprobe was developed for 590 sensitive POC detection of H1N1 (swine flu) in human nasal swabs (Ravina et al., 2020). The 591 complementary ssDNA probe immobilized on cysteine-functionalized screen-printed gold 592 electrode was able to generate electrochemical differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signal upon 593 hybridization to target genome in the presence of redox indicator methylene blue (MB",

Reprinted with permission from Ref (Zou et al., 2019). 626 B) A nano-enabled photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor for HIV-1 virus detection (Wang et al., 2019). C) Lab-on-a-chip approach to evaluate electrophysiology of cell during HIV frameworks (ZIF-8) to design oligo FRET sensing platform to detect 20-bp HIV 633 proviral DNA (Pan et al., 2018). Fluorophore-tagged ss-DNA got adsorbed on ZIF-8 through \u03a0-\u03a0 634 stacking and electrostatic interactions, resulting in quenching of FAM fluorescence due to the 635 photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. Thereafter, desorption of probe DNA from ZIF-8 636 occurs due to complementary base pairing with target DNA leading to fluorescence regeneration. 637 The formed ss-DNA@ ZIF-8 biosensing system can be used effectively to design optical POCT 638 device for early diagnosis of HIV-1 DNA. Another promising approach is the functionalization of 639 electrode with graphene-based nanocomposites for the improvement of sensing sensitivity. 640 641 For example, Gong et al. reported an impedimetric method for the determination of HIV virus 642 through direct electron transfer (Gong et al., 2017). In this strategy, L-cysteine modified graphene 643 oxide (GO) was drop casted on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to provide better electron-644 transfer kinetics. On the GO-modified GCE electrode, the capture probe was immobilized for direct 645 determination of different concentrations of HIV-1. The result demonstrated good selectivity and 646 successful detection HIV-1 gene from 1.0\u00d710 -13 to 1.0\u00d710 -10 M. Zou et al. developed novel DNA 647 probe-stabilized silver nanoclusters (AgNCs)-based fluorescent device to detect two HIV 648 oligonucleotides (1 & 2) at the same time (Zou et al., 2019). Here, HIV-1 was detected using green 649 emitting AgNCs probe lighted up by guanine (G)-rich sequence while HIV-2 detection relies on the 650 dimer of AgNCs generating orange fluorescence signals (Fig. study, toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions (TMSDRs)-mediated 654 fluorescent biosensor was designed against HIV gene (Li et al., 2019). In this system, target gene 655 (HIV-1) binds to the toehold region of the triplicate-stranded DNA substrate probe (SP) through 656 complementary base pairing and initiate the enzyme free amplification reaction, resulting in 657 production of plentiful G-quadruplex. This G-quadruplex sequences selectively show binding 658 affinity towards N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) complex. Formation of G-quadruplex/NMM 659 complex dramatically increased the intensity of fluorescence signal that leads to high sensitivity 660 for the HIV-1 gene detection. The designed system meets all the need of POCT like cost-661 effectiveness, isothermal operation, and flexibility. 662 663 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) technique also found to be a promising tool for fabrication of portable 664 biosensors. Wang et al. used QDs-functionalized ZnO nanorods to form photoactive interface on 665 gold paper electrode, offering increased charge transfer rate, tunable emission spectra, and 666 biocompatibility (Wang et al., 2019). This PEC biosensor (Fig. 9B) further modified with triple helix 667 structure for better specificity and binding affinity towards DNA sequence of HIV virus. A hairpin 668 structure DNA (H-DNA) as capture probe was conjugated onto the photoactive interface through 669 amide bond, and then a single-stranded DNA modified with gold nanoparticles labelled alkaline 670 phosphatase (ALP-Au NPs-DNA) at each end was introduced to hybridize with the H-DNA that 671 forms a triple-helix conformation. The T-DNA detection was based on the photocurrent response 672 change that results from conformation change of the triple-helix molecule after hybridization with 673 T-DNA. Alkaline phosphatase present in triple-helix molecular switch specifically catalysed the 674 diagnostics analytical tools, the monitoring of HIV progression has significant 683 importance to evaluate the efficacy assessment of a therapy, establishing a pathological 684 correlation between viral load and patient medical condition (Shafiee et al., 2013). In this 685 direction, Kaushik et al. developed a miniaturized system which can monitor the variation in 686 electrophysiology of the cell during HIV infection along with pre/post treatment. This research 687 demonstrates the application of LOC-based approach wherein cells were infected with HIV and 688 then treated with FDA-approved drug, as illustrated in Fig. 9C (Kaushik et al., 2016d). The 689 outcomes of the research suggested that variations in electrical properties on cell can be detected 690 at every step using EIS. This electrophysiology variation detection was also performed in setting of 691 drug abuse and specific treatment. Such systems can be promoted for clinical and POCT 692 application; however, a systemic research-based on real sample is suggested as a future research. 693 Further, integration of these POCT devices with IoT technology will enable the disease A) HPV POCT screening reduced progression to different cancer and mortality. B) 699 illustration of a CIALFB bioassay developed using CRISPR/Cas12a for the selective detection of HPV 700 18 and HPV 18 (Mukama et al., 2020). C) A Zn-dopped MoS 2 QD based ECL biosensor developed 701 for detecting HPV-16 DNA (Nie et al., 2020). 702 703 4.5 POC biosensing for Human papilloma virus infection HPV is infectious disease of reproductive tract and can be sexually transmitted. Some of the HPV 705 serotypes are oncogenic and cause cancer for lower genital tract, especially HPV16 infection. Here, 706 every women is at risk for lifetime as HPV infection can be chronic and pre-invasive malignant 707 lesions progress to different types of cancer, prominently to cervical cancer (refer to Fig. 10A) Chen et al., 2019). Global mission to prevent cervical cancer in poor countries require concerted 709 efforts to improve screening and access to treatment. HPV screening, during cervical intra-710 epithelial neoplasia (CIN), reduced the progression to cervical cancer and mortality. Mainly, the 711 HPV16 E6 and E7 sequences are conserved and thus can be utilized as an significant indicator for 712 screening of cervical cancer. HPV-DNA testing and Pap smears are standard protocols for 713 screening of cervical cancer in developed countries. However, these tests need manpower and currently the only validated HPV POC device (Sayed et al., 2020). GeneXpert, 717 developed by Cepheid is the only POCT endorsed by WHO for rapid diagnosis of HPV. The system 718 integrates microfluidic cartridge-based sample preparation with RT-PCR to perform isolation and 719 amplification in just 35 min. Grant et al. validated paper-based immunoassay amenable to 720 POCT(Grant et al., 2016). Here, LFA detects antibodies in a finger prick blood sample against 721 HPV16 to determine HPV immunization status. Furthermore, The use of self-collected vaginal 722 specimens is more feasible for large scale HPV testing in remote areas and low income countries 723 (Toliman et al., 2018). Integration of LFA methodology in biosensor provides inexpensive and rapid 724 means for determining isothermal amplification reaction. 725 726 Peng's group fabricated a fluorescent biosensor with extremely high selectivity and sensitivity for 727 the detection of HPV-18 (Peng et al., 2019). In this work, dye-labeled ssDNA probes were anchored 728 on ultrathin MXene nanosheets. MXene Ti 3 C 2 nanosheets (NSs) is of particular interest due to 729 ultrahigh quenching efficiency for a range of fluorescent dyes. Sensing strategy includes the 730 binding of probe with its complementary HPV DNA and forms dsDNA, which ultimately weakens 731 the interaction of dsDNA with MXene nanosheet, resulting in the fluorescence recovery. The 732 sensitivity of MXene-based sensor sensitivity is enhanced using Exo III enzyme cleave protruding 733 dye-labeled probe DNA. Liberated fluorophore leads to remarkable amplification of the 734 fluorescence emission, offering detection of HPA DNA at the level of 100 pM. Mukama et al. 735 validated a novel fluorescence diagnostic biosensor (Fig. 10 B) based on isothermal LAMP 736 amplification and the trans cleavage property of CRISPR/Cas system, which allowed selective 737 detection of HPV16 and HPV18 with the LOD of 3.1 amol (\u223c1.8 copies) (Mukama et al., 2020). 738 During detection, HPV sequence bind to a complementary capture oligo immobilized on the LFA 739 test line that lead to reporter sequences free for cleavage. Cas12a enzyme trans cleave all the 740 ssDNA reporter DNA labelled with both fluorescent and a quencher. 741 742 Teengam et al. postulated a paper-based electrochemical sensor to detect the HPV virus on the 743 surface of modified graphene-polyaniline (G-PANI) electrode (Teengam et al., 2017a). The 744 electrode was prepared by printing conductive G-PANI nanostructures on to the paper through 745 inkjet printing process that further indicates the potential of POCT commercialization for viral 746 diagnosis. Later, anthraquinone-labelled pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA) probe (AQ-747 PNA) was immobilized onto the electrode surface to detect 14 bp synthetic oligonucleotide 748 sequence like HPV DNA using square-wave voltammetry. In another study, Gopinath and 749 colleagues developed a carbon nanotube FET (CNTFET) based biosensor for the detection of HPV 750 infections in early stages (Gopinath et al., 2018). Here, HPV DNA probe was deposited onto the 751 nanotubes using electrodeposition method. The electrical interfaces are than 757 functionalized with oligo probes for the determination of HPV. Biosensor was highly stable up to 6 758 weeks and offered a low LOD of 1 fM in the linear range of 0.01 pM to 1 \u00b5M. Recently, Nie et al. 759 designed Zn-doped MoS2 QDs based electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensor (Fig. 10 C) (Nie et al., 760 2020). Reductive Cu(I) particles enhanced the ECL activity of QDs up to fivefold. Furthermore, the 761 system is sensitized with an enzyme-assisted DNA walker specific for HPV 16 DNA. The 762 methodology offered efficient amplification of ECL signal on the electrode surface for POC HPV 763 determination. For the determination of the HPV16 E6 and E7 gene, Hong and colleagues 764 proposed label free electrochemical biosensor that offered an extremely low LOD of 18.6 amol (Y. 765 He et al., 2020). In this study, amplification strategy like entropy-driven amplification and rolling 766 circle amplification were required to amplify the signal in the low concentration scrape sample. In 767 the absence of target HPV gene sequence, MB dye can easily approach the surface of electrode, 768 resulting in the changes of signal. Conversely, the presence of target gene in test sample triggered 769 the amplification reaction and produced numerous DNA molecules that embed MB into it. This 770 further allows only minimal amount of MB to reach surface of electrode, leading to a drop in signal 771 intensity. The integration of these quantitative detection platforms with smartphones can help in 772 spatiotemporal mapping of disease and pathogen tracking by utilizing web-based surveillance (.6 POC-biosensing for Ebola virus infection 776 EBOV (Fig. 11 A-C) is another deadly zoonotic virus emerges from fruit bats that led to largest 777 outbreak in West Africa during 2014-2016. Syndromes of Ebola infection overlap substantially with 778 other viral fevers (like dengue fever) that greatly complicate the health management and decision-779 making process. Presently, five different EBOV serotypes have been discovered, named as 780 Bundibugyo, Sudan, Reston, Tai Forest, and Zaire. The incubation period estimated to be 2 to 21 781 days for the emerging EVD (Fig. 11 D). Asymptomatic patients are not infectious and even infected 782 human remain contagious as long as their blood contains the virus. EVD has not been reported to 783 be transmitted by aerosols. Rapid isolation of infected patient, tracing of contact, and early 784 diagnosis of suspected cases is the best way to stop transmission (Key facts about major deadly 785 diseases Managing epidemics, 2020). Real time RT-PCR is among the most widely accepted 786 method for EBOV detection with high sensitivity and specificity. Epidemics and outbreaks 787 emphasize the need for POC diagnostic tools. For example, Baca & colleagues demonstrate 788 potential of surface acoustic waves (SAW) technology in designing label-free biosensor (Baca et al., 789 2015). Such sensors detect EBOV directly in raw specimens like blood, serum, faeces, and saliva, 790 thereby eliminating the need of sample preparation. Moreover, the technology is beneficial in 791 designing portable and rapid POCT, allowing viral detection within 2 min (refer to Fig. 11E). The 792 piezoelectric sensor chips patterned with inter-digital transducers were coated with antibodies 793 specific for EBOV. The surface of sensor has a characteristic resonant frequency, and the binding 794 event results in a phase shift of the signal wave that can be quantified through interface device. 795 The SAW POCT revolutionized the diagnostic platform via enabling early treatment in pandemic 796 responses. Broadhurst et al. performed field validation of the ReEBOV Antigen dipstick test that 797 detects EBOV VP40 matrix protein against a gold standard RT-PCR assay. The study indicates 100% sensitivity (Broadhurst et al., 2015). These thermocycler platforms can be miniaturized Microscopic illustration of EBOV (A-C; Source NIAID of NIH) and strategy (D) along with 807 its impact to manage EVD outbreak. It is predicted that use of advanced POCT approach, EBOV 808 infection can be managed to reduce mortality via diseases management approach. E) illustration 809 of a IoMT-assisted biosensing system developed for POCT of IgG antibodies for selective 810 diagnostics of EBOV (Brangel et al., 2018). F) illustration of AgNPs of multicolour feature 811 developed for multiplexed diagnostics of dengue fever, yellow fever, and EVD (Yen et al., 2015). 812 813 Another study developed portable cell phone sized and battery-powered PCR device to detect 814 EBOV RNA using single step RT-PCR (Ahrberg et al., 2016). This POCT quantify viral load in small 815 sample volume by performing four RT-PCRs concurrently: two samples, one positive control 816 containing RNAs from both with EBOV and human transcript glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 817 dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and one negative control. A virtual reaction chamber (VRC) was formed 818 by a sample covered with an oil located on the cover slip of the disposable glass microscope. 819 Further this biosensing system is integrated with a miniaturized fluorescence detector to monitor 820 the progress of amplification reaction. The viral load in the simulated sample of patient was 821 determined by relative quantification of EBOV to GAPDH expression. The entire process was 822 conducted in a very short time span (less than 37 min). In addition, isothermal amplification 823 (LAMP) methodologies also allow designing of POCT performed outside of centralized 824 laboratories. Here, Benzine et al. employed RT-LAMP molecular diagnostic for rapid detection of 825 EBOV directly from whole blood (Benzine et al., 2016). In this case, reaction formulation was 826 freeze dried and amplified EBOV specific glycoprotein gene in a battery-operated isothermal 827 instrument. The results indicated specificity of POCT for EBOV, avoiding any kind of non-RNs@Au to increase the sensitivity of LFA against EBOV (Hu et al., 2017). 835 This nanoplatform generated dual signal, i.e., one is fluorescent for quantification and other is 836 colorimetric for visual readouts. The assay enables smart detection of virus using antibody and 837 streptavidin (SA)-labelled nanospheres where reaction of SA with biotin amplify the signal 838 intensity. The sensitivity of assay successfully tested in field work to detect EBOV in spiked 839 samples and found to be a capable candidate for early diagnosis of EBOV in endemic areas. An 840 IoMT sensor integrating LFA (Fig. 11 E) with computational abilities is designed specifically to 841 detect recombinant Ebola viral protein. Customized smart phone-integrated POC collect both test 842 results and geographical information with high sensitivity and specificity (Brangel et al., 2018). 843 Ilkhani et al. explored highly specific thiolated DNA probe to design electrochemical sensor to 844 detect Ebola in endemic countries (Ilkhani and Farhad, 2018). In this POCT, hybridized DNA was 845 fabricated on screen printed electrode for DPV sensing of viral strain with a detection among the highly feared infectious disease due to its contagious nature and the rapid 849 development of acute infection. Therefore, while selecting POC technologies, it is important to 850 consider different practical aspects for intensive care of patients. Recently, there is a huge 851 demand of multiplex diagnostics to detect multiple marker specific for different pathogens in a 852 single strip to increases the speed and lowering the cost of screening. Yen & group exploited 853 optical properties of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) for fabricating LFA devices (Fig. 11F) against 854 DENV, EBOV, and yellow fever viruse (YFB), simultaneously (Yen et al., 2015). Based on the size 855 dependent emissive behaviour of Ag-NPs, three different range of AgNPs (e.g., orange, red, and 856 green) were conjugated with YFV-Ab, EBOV-Ab, and DENV-Ab, respectively. These AgNPs were 857 easily distinguishable from one another when applied to paper. In this case, the color of the test 858 lines distinguishes the different viral biomarkers. 859 8604.7 POC-biosensing for ZIKA virus infection861    The ZIKV(Fig. 12 A), dengue fever, chikungunya, and yellow fever all belongs to a common family862 of flaviridae (Kaushik et al., 2017). These emerging infectious diseases were seen after a decade in 863 brazil and then spread rapidly in whole America. More recently, travel-associated cases of ZIKV 864 infection have also been reported. ZIKV is also an arbovirus mainly propagated through 865 arthropods like mosquitoes, most commonly from the Aedes species (Kaushik et al., 2017). ZIKV 866 has been first of its kind that shows unusual symptoms like sexual transmission, microcephaly, and 867 other severe neurological defects (Fauci and Morens, 2016). However, ZIKV-infection caused 868 classical symptoms like fever, headache, and chills have resemblance to many other febrile 869 diseases (Kaushik et al., 2017). But the continuing reports on infectious diseases pandemics need 870 IoMT based diagnostics to monitor patients. To detect ZIKV, the emergency use of the IgM 871 antibody capture ELISA (Zika MAC-ELISA) and Trioplex rRT-PCR laboratory test has recently been 872 authorized by the FDA (Chen et al., 2019). To detect ZIKV, LFA technology was also applied to 873 integrate molecular diagnostics. In this work, distinguished features of QDs (like broad excitation, 874 tunable emission spectra, and high quantum yield) were exploited for fluorescent LFAs (Rong et 875 al., 2019). ZIKV RNA-specific antibody was conjugated to QDs, forming an immune complex in the 876 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f presence of target antigen on the test line of LFA strip. Later, the test strip was illuminated using 877 handheld ultraviolet (UV) LED lamp to excite QDs microsphere. The intensity of , pioneered POC technologies were also demonstrated for many emerging infectious 882 diseases and recently for ZIKV. For example, Mendes Duarte & colleagues optimized biosensor for 883 direct detection of ZIKV while maintaining high sensitivity using specific RT-LAMP amplification Estrela et al., 2019). The amplification was isothermally progressed for 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. RT-LAMP 885 reaction directly on a serum sample, without prior RNA extraction, provides opportunity for early 886 diagnosis with a detection limit of 1 fM. Here, visual detection of amplification was based on 887 phenol red acid-base indicator. POCT found significant application in the differential diagnosis of 888 ZIKV from DENV and chikungunya. The similarity of clinical symptoms by these diseases poses a 889 critical clinical challenge. To this end, RT-qPCR method was used by Broeders & team to detect 890 ZIKV and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses in a single test (Broeders et al., 2020). A new fourplex RT-891 qPCR assay was thoroughly validated directly for non-invasive samples like urine and saliva. Most 892 importantly independent sequences for each virus have been used to overcome false-negative 893 results. The obtained data is further analysed using the bioinformatic tool that help to validate the 894 performance of the existing molecular diagnostic approaches. 895 896 Label-free electrochemical sensors simplify the detection of genetic materials, offering a great 897 advantage in clinical analyses. Direct detection of virions in samples reduces the time and cost of 898 analysis. Thus, label-free genosensors found their way in diagnosis of infectious diseases. Likewise, 899 impedimetric electrochemical DNA biosensor has been designed for label-free detection of ZIKV Faria and Zucolotto, 2019). For this, disposable electrode is fabricated through metallization 901 where vapours of gold layered get deposited on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates by 902 thermal evaporation. The electrode surface was further modified with complementary capture 903 DNA probes hybridized with the ZIKV genomes in sample. The hybridization event offered readout 904 at room temperature with a 1.5 h response time along with a LOD of 25.0 \u00b1 1.7 nM. Similarly, 905 another genosensor was suggested in the pioneer work of Sotomayor & group (da Fonseca Alves 906 et al., 2019). The electrochemical sensor was designed using pencil carbon graphite electrodes. 907 Here, for the intact immobilization of oligoprobes without losing activity, polymeric film derived 908 from 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-4-AHBA) was coated on electrode surface. Hybridization 909 with Zika oligo sequence resulted into higher electrostatic repulsion due to the increase of 910 phosphates by addition of the complementary target sequence. Disposable, three-contact 911 biosensor on a gold-PET electrode has been developed for the label-free detection of ZIKV oligo 912 sequences at concentrations above 54 nM in a drop of sample within 90 min (Faria and Zucolotto, 913 2019). The results demonstrated high reproducibility and allowed differentiation among the 914 oligonucleotide sequence of ZIKV and the closely associated dengue virus. 915 916 One study reported the direct identification of ZIKV from whole blood sample of an infected 917 individual by smartphone-integrated POCT using nanoparticle-conjugated antibodies (Hsu et al., 918 2020). Here, platinum nanoparticles were successfully deposited onto the Au seeds to synthesize 919 Pt@Au core-shell nanoparticles. Subsequently, these nanoparticles uniformly decorated on glassy 920 chip via polyethyleneimine functionalization. The developed system can suitably meet the urgent 921 needs of POCT in endemic regions with stressed resources for ZIKV detection. In this study, 922 prepared chip was fitted inside the lid of a vial, which can be used specifically to capture ZIKV. The serum spiked with variety of antigens introduced into a chip containing vial A) Illustration of ZIKV protein (Cyro-TEM imaging a & b), B) interdigitated electrode and 931 electrochemical immunosensing approach for detecting ZIKV protein at 10 pM level, C) a strategy 932 to develop a miniaturized sensing system to POCT of ZIKV protein needed for personalized POCT approach for selective detection of ZIKV protein at 10 pM level was also 936 proposed by Kaushik el al (Fig. 12 B -C) (Kaushik A, 2018). In this research, author functionalized 937 interdigitated electrode using self-assembled monolayer to immobilize an anti-ZIKV antibody for 938 the selective detection of envelop zika-protein virus. This sensor was selective with reference to 939 major flavivirus protein and detected ZIKV selectively at 10 pM level within 45 minutes. Due to 940 capabilities of miniaturisation and desired sensing performance, this sensor is projected for POCT 941 application after integrating this sensing chip with a miniaturized electrochemical analyser and 942 optimization of smartphone-based operation. However, further research studies focus on ZIKV 943 detection from real samples (Kaushik et al., 2018; Kaushik A, 2018)). 944 945 4.8 POC-biosensing for SARS and MERS 946 Besides above discussed infectious diseases, this century witnessed many other pandemic 947 diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome 948 (MERS). February 2003, marks the emergence of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in mainland China 949 and subsequently transmitted to global boundaries (de Wit et al., 2016). SARS-CoV infect humans 950 from their reservoir host bats hints they can re-emerge. later in 2015, another coronavirus MERS 951 emerged and spread to Arabian Peninsula. Now, COVID-19, still present in our community, revealed in Wuhan, China, and spread to 90% of the countries on our planet within 2 months. and are fatal with lung injuries, multi-organ, and heart failure in certain cases, 957 especially the older people or individuals having co-occurring diseases (Ezhilan et al., 2021). 958 959 It has been demonstrated that COVID-19 infection pandemic is not a single respiratory disease, 960 but it creates a complex medical condition where organs affected by SARS-CoV-2 and exhibited 961 alteration in biological function. Moreover, this pandemic is emerging more seriously due to its 962 easy human to human transmission (though aerosol droplets) which depends on various factor, as 963 summarized in Fig. 2. Significant efforts have been made to manage COVID-19 pandemic such aspeople aware to motivate them to understand pandemic consequences and use mask 967 for avoiding infection transmission (Fig. 13B) (Z. Huang et al., 2020; Kaushik et al., 2020; Paliwal et 968 al., 2020). As it has been declared that combinational approaches are required at the same time to 969 eradicate COVID-19 infection. To avoid errors, an optimized solution can be projected by analysis 970 of risks and prediction of the effects of a therapy along with consequences associated with 971 population of every race and age, AI is emerging as a very supporting component, as illustrated in 972 Fig. 13 C. Kaushik et al summarized the significance of developing efficient and effective nano-973 enabled sensing systems, electrochemical SARS-CoV-2 virus detection as one of the examples, 974 which can detect a COVID-19 selectively at pM level (Fig. 13 D) (Kaushik et al., 2020). Such low 975 scale virus detection capabilities are required to understand diseases progression and also to 976 evaluate efficacy of prescribed therapy. These bio-sensing techniques are well supported by AI 977 and IoMT to perform diagnostics at POC site and to analyse generated bioinformatics as per the 978 individual diseases profiling. Considering significance of outcomes into consideration, these 979 diagnostics system are recommended for early-stage viral infection identification and to manage 980 viral infection in personalized manner for a overall intelligent healthcare (Fig. 13E) (Kaushik et al.First reported in December 2019 (Wuhan city of China) and causes COVID-19 infection pandemic \u2022 Virus is associated with an outbreak of Pneumonia \u2022 Some victims were older males with pre-existing conditions. \u2022 Cases: > 55 M confirmed; 1.3 M (Nov. 15, 2020). \u2022 In USA, > 15 M confirmed; 251 K (Nov. 15, 2020) Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) \u2022 First reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. \u2022 Cases: 2,494 confirmed cases; 858 deaths (as of Nov. 30, 2019).

Generally nonlethal with rare exceptions \u2022 Circulates year-round, but more common in fall/winter. 986 987 SPR technique has important implications in diagnostic POCT due to its ability to measure 988 biomolecular interactions directly without labelling. Hence, Guo & colleagues suggested SPR 989 analysis for SARS-CoV in which sensor chip carrying streptavidin captures the biotinylated DNA 990 (Yang et al., 2008). It is then used as interface to study the interactions between RNA and corona 991 virus nucleocapsid (N) protein. The proposed diagnostic tool ensures the highly specific affinity of 992 interactions within one chip. Kim et al. designed label-free colorimetric MERS-CoV biosensor (H. 993 Kim et al., 2019). Here, surfaces of AuNPs capped with thiolated ss-DNA target two genomic 994 regions of MERS-CoV virus. Hybridization reaction led to changes in localized SPR signal and colour 995 of AuNPs when subjected to UV light. The fabricated sensing element is also suitable for the on-996 site diagnosis of MERS-CoV upto the level of 1 pM/ \u00b5L. The sensitivity of proposed sensors signifies 997 the integration of biotechnology with nanotechnology, revolutionising the fabrication of 998 biosensors for the diagnosis of viral infections in non-invasive fluid samples. 999 1000 Recently, low cost SPR sensor was reported for rapid detection and quantification of COVID-19. 1001 Nano-plasmonic sensor chips were designed specially using periodic nanostructures functionalized 1002 with SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (L. Huang et al., 2020). Next, the chips were 1003 integrated into microwell plate or microfluidic cuvette, and the assay was analysed using handheld 1004 optical equipment controlled by a smartphone application. A dual functional approach (i.e., nano-1005 plasmonic and photothermal features), based on biosensing protype was designed for the 1006 detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus protein (Fig. 14 A)(Qiu et al., 2020). In this research, nano islands of 1007 Au were functionalized with gene receptors (complimentary DNA) for the detection of targeted 1008 SARS-CoV-2 virus gene sequence selectively based on in situ nucleic acid hybridization, as a 1009 function of heat generated by Au nanoisland on stimulation. Such plasmonic photothermal 1010 effects-based sensing prototype (i.e., localized SPR) is selective and offered a detection limit of 1011 0.22 pM (Qiu et al., 2020). 1012 1013 Recently, Layqah & Eissa developed an electrochemical immunosensor based on AuNPs-modified 1014 interdigitated carbon electrodes for MERS-CoV detection (Layqah and Eissa, 2019). The sensing 1015 mechanism includes array of eight electrodes for detection of different CoV antigens 1016 simultaneously in the spike nasal fluid. Along with good linearity (0.001-100 ng mL \u22121 ), the 1017 fabricated interdigitated carbon electrode offered a low LOD of 1 pg mL -1 . In this direction, An FET, 1018 fabricated using graphene, was explored to develop an immuno-sensing platform for the 1019 detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus protein (Fig. 14 B)(Seo et al., 2020). This sensor exhibited SARS-CoV-1020 2 virus detection at 1.6 x 10 1 pfu/mL in culture media and 2.42 x 10 2 copies/mL in real sample 1021 collected form nasal swab. Due to scaling up capability and selective virus detection at low level, such FET based SARS-CoV-2 virus sensor projected for POCT application to manage COVIDA) Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 virus structure sites useful for targeting to achieve COVID-1028 19 diagnostics, B) schematic presentation of usefulness of using mask to avoid human-to-human 1029 SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission, C) proposed role of AI to manage COVID-19 infection successfully, 1030 D) electrochemical immunosensing of SARS-CoV-2 virus protein at pM level needed for selective 1031 diagnostics at early-stage, E) projected nano-enabled COVIDstudy, Zhao et al. developed a reliable electrochemical detection technology for COVID-1035 19 using functionalized graphene oxide. The proposed technology detects RNA of SARS-CoV-2 1036 without amplification by using smartphone equipped with DPV workstation (Zhao et al., 2021). 1037 Early detection seems to be the best way to stop the pandemic, which would not be possible using 1038 conventional analytical techniques. Owing to the advantages of paper-based POCs, LFA based 1039 POCTs are also proposed for emerging respiratory corona viruses. For example, Henry & group 1040 coupled PADs with AgNPs colorimetric assay (Teengam et al., 2017b). When pyrrolidinyl peptide 1041 nucleic acid (acpcPNA) linked AgNPs nanoparticles hybridized effectively with complementary 1042 MERS-CoV DNA in human blood sample, it led to dispersion of AgNPs and consequently change in 1043 color. The proposed sensor was used as multiplex POCT for simultaneous detection of MERS-CoV, 1044 HPV, and Mycobacterium. Recently, developed LFA against SARS-CoV-2 exploited the binding 1045 affinity of COVID-19 structural protein S1 to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) domain (Lee 1046 et al., 2020). LFA identify matched pair at 1.86 \u00d7 105 copies/mL LOD and specifically without any 1047 cross reactivity to other corona viruses like SARS and MERS. To improve sensitivity of LFA, Chen et 1048 al introduced lanthanide-doped polystyrene nano-platform in designing to achieve SARS-CoV-2 1049 detection within 10 minutes (Chen et al., 2020)(Fig. 14 C). This IgG-based sensitive fluorescent 1050 bioassay captured recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 on self-assembled nano-system. This nano-enabled LFA was validated by testing COVID-19 infected 12 patients and Due to tuneable properties and guided approach, magnetic systems are also emerging as choice of 1095 developing sensitive and selective biosensor for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus protein. Recently, 1096 Ahmadivand et al developed a toroidal plasmonic sensor for the effective and efficient detection 1097 of SARS)-CoV-2 virus protein at femtomolar (fM) level, for the first time. In this research, magneto-1098 plasmonic was produced by nano-Au modified magnetic platform on applying terahertz (THz) as 1099 stimulation, and further monitored as a function of monoclonal antibody and SARS-CoV-2 virus 1100 protein (Fig. 14 D) (Ahmadivand et al., 2021). Such plasmonic immunosensor functions on the 1101 basis of toroidal electrodynamics concept and can detect the spiked protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus at 1102 4.2 fM. This development is at early and authors have projected its POCT application after 1103 validation using real samples. A magnetic beads assisted electrochemical immunosensing 1104 approach was developed by Fabiani et all for the selective detection of SARS-CoV-2 protein in 1105 saliva samples (Fig. 15 A) (Fabiani et al., 2021). In this electrochemical assay fabricated using 1106 screen-printed electrodes, magnetic beads support immunological chain and suitable bindings 1107 needed between selected antibody and spike protein (19 ng/mL) or nucleocapsid protein (8 1108 ng/mL) site of SARS-CoV-2 virus structure. This sensor detected SARS-CoV-2 virus protein 1109 selectively within 30 minutes and validated using saliva of COVID-19 infected patients. A) illustration of magnetic bead based electrochemical SARS-CoV-2 immunosensor for 1115 the selective detection of S and N terminal of virus protein (Fabiani et al., 2021). B) Schematic 1116 presentation of a graphene-based electrochemical sensing platform for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus (projected as telemedicine platform i.e., SARS-CoV-2 RapidPlex) in saliva and blood, advancements in coronavirus detection, the bioinformatics needed to be analysed 1124 by medical experts for suggesting an appropriate therapy. In this direction, IoMT are playing 1125 crucial role and experts have established sensing methodologies with the feature of wireless 1126 communication, a foundation of telemedicine (Torrente-Rodr\u00edgueaz et al., 2020). Recently, IoT 1127 based biosensor 'RapidPlex' was grafted for ultra-rapid assessment of COVID-19 biomarkers 1128 (Torrente-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2020). This is also a multiplex electrochemical platform to quantify four 1129 different COVID-19 antigens: nucleocapsid protein, inflammatory C-reactive protein (CRP), IgM, 1130 and IgG antibodies in test sample. Laser-engraved graphene (LEG) electrode functionalized with 1131 antigen specific antibodies detects target molecules, and the hybridization reaction reflect 1132 through current intensity. Rapid target binding capability of proposed platform is the market reports 2020, the global POC diagnostic market size was $18.45 billion in 2019 1137 which was estimated to reach $23.36 billion by 2027 at a compound annual growth rate of 7.3% 1138 (\"Point-of-care (POC) Diagnostics Market Size, Share | Report, 2027,\" 2020). The novel biosensors 1139 based POC can diagnose the emerging infectious disease in seconds that is the need of the hour. 1140 The demand of POC devices for self-diagnostics is likely to increase among patients. Several 1141 industries or research organizations are working on development of off-the-shelf or customized 1142 POC devices, e.g., ChipShop Dolomite, Abbott Laboratories, Cellix Ltd., Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1143 Agilent Technologies, and many more (Mej\u00eda-Salazar et al., 2020). Race towards technological 1144 advances in POC devices provide beneficial insight into opportunities, trends, and challenges. POC 1145 devices based on LFA are clinically more successful due to user-friendly operation. In contrast, 1146 microfluidics and biosensor based POC diagnostic are still under development, facing challenges in 1147 terms of both implementation and interpretation along with clinical validations. In this era of 1148 pandemics, POCT devices will significantly contribute towards economics due to robust and low-1149 cost diagnosis (Ahmad et al., 2020). POC biosensors are portable devices hence can be available in 1150 remote locations and resource-limited settings. Moreover, early detection of infectious diseases 1151 benefits the government in controlling the outbreak. Rapid and accurate testing contributes 1152 significantly to epidemiologic studies and surveillance to estimate health status and future 1153 outbreaks of such infectious diseases. 1154 1155 However, development and commercialization of advanced biosensor technology is a bigger 1156 challenge considering its technical aspects (Everitt et al., 2020). Several factors work together in 1157 preventing translation of academic research to commercially viable devices. Primarily, biosensors 1158",

            "text": "matrix compounds may lead to loss in activity hence compromised selectivity, and 1169 sensitivity of the biosensor. Another most important issue is biosafety not as stringently regulated1170    as in conventional diagnostics. Although advanced biosensors switching from reusable testing to1171    one-time disposable devices due to undeniable advantages like avoid infection spreading,1172    cleaning, and sterilization, but the investment in reusable devices comply with affordability1173    conditions. Hence, disposable POCT sometimes fails in resource-depleted regions and settings as 1174 eventually dominate the production costs. Besides, most of the POCT biosensors robustness1175    checked with target molecules-spiked samples while real specimen may relate to the usually low 1176 operational performance(Cammann et al., 1991). Presence of interfering substances in complex 1177 real samples can lead to nonspecific interfering signals at the level of the transducer element and 1178 hence low sensitivity. The modest stability of biomolecules for biosensing under working 1179 conditions (e.g., room temperature) may limit the performance of the biosensor after some 1180 months. Importantly, reported end-users does not rely on POC devices because of these technical aspects, POCT biosensors still need improvement in LOD limits to 1184 achieve detection in the amol (10 -18 M) range necessary for diagnostic assays with real and1185 nonamplified biological samples, whereas this is often beyond the fundamental limits of common 1186 sensing devices. Further, IoMT-based POC faces some challenges like electrode fouling, electrode 1187 drift, optical transducer blockage, probe degradation, and many. Despite being implemented in 1188 medical devices validations, the regulatory requirements, privacy, and risk assessment remain the 1189 main obstacle in IoMT-based POCs. Further, amplification-based diagnostics avail high-sensitivity 1190 biosensors, but their designing is still too complex and costly for front line POC diagnosis. 1191 Moreover, qualitative diagnostics is not suitable in these pandemic eras. Further, the 1192 quantification of serological level of biomarkers is needed to know the pathological states of 1193 diseases. Many POCT devices provides only qualitative outputs, indicating the presence or absence 1194 of biomarker in sample based on \"yes/no\" basis. Therefore in recent times LFA test strips also 1195 extended to quantitative measurement by incorporating small reader devices like charge-couple 1196 devices (St John and Price, 2014). This area grows well in near future with many devices being 1197 developed and likely to reach the commercial market in the coming years. Multiplexed 1198 diagnostics, analysing many targets in one frame of time, is very important tool for prompt and 1199 adequate case management in endemic areas (X. He et al., 2020). These layouts need much 1200 improvement in terms of sensitivity and cross reactivity, hence are under continuous research to 1201 accomplish the needs for high-throughput analysis. Rapid multiplexing diagnostics are of 1202 significant use, particularly in cases of co-infections. However, several questions remain 1203 unresolved in case of these multiplexed biosensing devices such as proper evaluation, device has been established for diagnostics application, a timely validation of such 1207 system based on standard and FDA approved protocols is always recommended for better public 1208 usage and clinical application. Clinical accuracy is one of major challenges in front of these IoMT-1209 integrated POC systems due to lack of understanding of quality control as well as quality assurance practices related mainly with IoMT (Shaw, 2016). To ensure the accuracy of results, the 1211 implementation of quality assurance program is essential in POCT. Thus, it requires the 1212 establishments of standards with help of government, institutions, and experts. Usually most of 1213 the academic development fails on the part of patients and only few qualifies the first evaluation 1214 stage (McRae et al., 2020). This is mainly because of discrepancy between perception and reality 1215 as laboratory testing are carried out indoors rather than in the health care settings. Researchers 1216 are working on to address these drawbacks and developing new diagnostic tools via wide range of 1217 unprecedented opportunities in diagnostic biomarkers, detections methodology, and advanced 1218 nanomaterials (Califf, 2018). Moreover, computer-aided diagnosis systems or IoMT requires 1219 integration of big data analysis where different tools need to be explored like visualization tools, 1220 ML, and data mining. Data transmission and processing device play a major role in eHealth 1221 diagnostics, involving several challenges in terms of monitoring of patient's activities and health 1222 (Vitabile et al., 2019). In comparison to analogue approaches, computer-based or digital tools are 1223 more efficient and usually preferred by physicians. Beyond these technical challenges, clinical 1224 barriers also limit their performance. The main challenge is suitable disease biomarker that 1225 typically enable early diagnosis using simplified matrices in addition to allow testing at low level. 1226 Novel clinically relevant biomarkers from the advanced genomics and proteomics technique can 1227 be used to increase diagnostic accuracy. Predictive biomarkers facilitate early diagnosis as it can 1228 help identify individuals in early stages of diseases. Moreover, biomarker that can be detected in a 1229 non-invasive specimen is preferred for real time POCT devices. Hence, diagnostic biomarkers 1230 development together with sensing technology are reshaping diagnostic and therapeutic sciences 1231 as it prioritizes the quality and reproducibility of the POCT. Better understanding of progression of 1232 disease, virulence factors, and alteration in gene expression are also helpful in clinical research in materials science and nanotechnology exhibit several advantages in 1236 context of detection technology, e.g., higher sensitivity and lower detection limits (Mishra et al., 1237 2020; Rani et al., 2020; Syedmoradi et al., 2017). Wide range of nano-systems and their 1238 composites materials such as polymers, CNT, graphene, metal nanoparticles, metal oxides, 1239 hybrids, liquid crystals etc., have been investigated for designing smart nano-platforms for 1240 biomolecule immobilization, miniaturization, surface functionalization, and tuning of 1241 optoelectronic properties (Kumar et al., 2015; S. Kumar et al., 2018a, 2018b; Nehra et al., 2019; 1242 Samaddar et al., 2018). Predictably, such uniform fabrication will be useful to develop a sensing 1243 device of desired features wherein reproducibility and reliability considered as keys. 1244 1245 Presently, efforts are being made to support such POCT by the technological development 1246 investigated in the field of IoMT to achieve wireless based operation and connectivity with health 1247 expert and medical centre (Sadoughi et al., 2020). These IoMT devices are a viable alternative to 1248 bulky and expensive laboratory systems. Keeping advancements and prospects into consideration, 1249 current research focuses on exploring IoMT-assisted advanced biosensor technologies for POCT of 1250 infectious diseases associated with HIV/HPV, malaria, dengue fever, H1N1, HIV, HPV, Ebola, ZIKV, 1251 and COVID-19 infection. An optimized IoMT-assisted POCT will be useful to manage a targeted 1252 infectious disease via understanding diseases progression, decide treatment, and evaluate efficacy 1253 of prescribed therapy. POC devices must fulfil all the standard evaluation criteria put forth by the 1254 WHO using the acronym ASSURED-affordable, sensitive, specific, user friendly, rapid and robust, 1255 equipment-free, and deliverable to those in need (Everitt et al., 2020). The application of new 1256 advancements to the enormous medical needs of developing countries is a major challenge for the public sector. Moreover, the healthcare diagnostic under IoMT-assisted network faces huge 1258 security challenges. The attack on healthcare system can cause damage beyond imagination via 1259 losing control over the life supporting equipment (Shrivastava et al., 2020b). Thus, securing 1260",

For example, development of colour change in 300 ELISA-based assay can be identified by smart POCs, and captured images can be further analysed 301 using customized applications to quantify the pathogens. While to achieve sensitive smartphone 302 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f fluorescence detection, a variety of optical accessories need to be added. Similarly, IoT-based POC 303 devices have been reported with easy read-out platforms for detection of different infectious 304 diseases, with the help of different molecular assays including lateral flow, PCR, and loop-305 mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) for detection of emerging pathogens, refer 306 to Table 1. Further, electrochemical IoMT consists of fabricated integrated circuits to acquire 307 clinical signals and enable real-time detection of pathogen. In recent years, POC systems integrated with machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., artificial 310 intelligence (AI) resulted in a new paradigm shift towards data-analytics-based decision making 311 (McRae et al., 2016). AI provides an additional option to medical practitioner in terms of specific 312 treatment to individuals and observation of their outcomes. Using these AI systems, health care 313 officials capable of assessing risks of different diseases like heart attack, cancer, and trauma in 314 patients. The AI sensors initially perform the multistep assay using portable analyser which further 315 automatically digitize the biomarker concentrations. With the help of acquired, the spectrum of 316 diseases can be predicted using numerous algorithms, e.g., classification, cluster, pattern, and 317 features of diseases to make treatment decisions. M-Health is a WHO global observatory used to 318 display results to the patients and supported by different wireless devices, such as cell phones and 319 personal digital assistants (Wang et al., 2017). Thus, health analytics provide patients with 320 personalized care for active management and prevention of disease risks. The real time POC 321 diagnostics and ML combinedly revolutionised the healthcare sector. The IoMT market growth is 322 expected to pace up more with the integration of AI into the connected ecosystem for automated 323 prescription possible (Shrivastava et al., 2020a).Table 1.

This visual score may be considered a marker for monitoring disease evolution. In addition to this quantitative approach, several papers have recently investigated biological, clinical, and radiological markers that influence disease behavior [8] [9] [10] . In this regard, the influence of pulmonary ossification in disease evolution nowadays is still uncertain. Diffuse pulmonary ossification (DPO) is a rare form of ILD and it is less frequent in patients without a background of lung disease. DPO is characterized by small tiny calcifications, with or without bone marrow, located in the subpleural regions of lungs. Among the two forms (dendriform and nodular) described in literature, the dendriform DPO is more often associated with chronic obstructive lung disease and interstitial fibrosis ( Figure 1 ) (Table 1) [11] [12] [13] . The presence of DPO can help the diagnose of Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) and it can be considered as an ancillary finding of fibrosis [14, 15] . [12] ).",

It represents how tall and sharp the central peak is. A high value of kurtosis could indicate mild IPF, whereas a low kurtosis could indicate severe IPF. Skewness refers to the tendency of a distribution that determines its symmetry about the mean; it represents the asymmetry in a statistical distribution, in which the curve appears distorted or skewed either to the left or to the right. It represents the amount and direction of the skew. A perfectly symmetric distribution would have a skewness value of zero. A low skewness is correlated to a more fibrotic parenchyma and a more advanced disease. HAA% is indicative of parenchymal lesions, such as ground-glass opacity and reticulation. It was calculated as percentages of the extracted whole lung volume with attenuation values greater than 250 HU and less than 600 HU, as performed in the study by Ash et al. [6] .",

HRCT fibrosis visual score showed to be a non-useful tool to assess the difference in terms of gravity of fibrosis between the two groups. It should be noted that the two groups were homogeneous, with UIP and possible UIP patients, so, in no extremely severe cases, patterns could be approximately similar in the analyzed slices; precisely, the HRCT fibrosis score assesses the percentage of a pattern in only six slices of the whole lung, while quantitative indexes study the whole parenchyma, so HRCT fibrosis score could lead to a less specific evaluation. Finally, HRCT fibrosis score is a visual assessment (\"eyeballing\"), limited by many factors, first of all operator experience and personal interpretation.",

Focusing our attention on quantitative data, first of all, kurtosis seemed to be a worse condition (lower values of kurtosis) in patients with DPO compared to non-DPO patients; moreover, the DPO group showed generally worse values of HAA% and skewness, although the difference was not statistically significant. These findings are promising and deserve further evaluation and work, to replicate these associations in larger cohorts; moreover, it could be interesting to apply this evaluation in a prospective view, to determine important changes in follow-up HRCT and in outcomes in both groups. In conclusion, prognostic significance of DPO in IPF needs to be deeply evaluated. ",

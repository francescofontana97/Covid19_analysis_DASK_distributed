(2020) who have shown that lower-income people have experienced less social distancing due to fear of losing income during COVID-19 but also by Borjas (2020) who has shown that the likelihood that a test was positive was larger in predominantly black neighborhoods in New York City. The results are also supported by other studies such as by Baker, Farrokhnia, Meyer, Pagel, and Yannelis (2020) who have shown that higher-income people move less and thus spend less in restaurants, groceries or retailers during COVID-19 or by Bonaccorsi, Pierri, Cinelli, Porcelli, Galeazzi, Flori, Schmidt, and Valensise (2020) who have shown that mobility contraction is stronger in municipalities, where inequality is higher and income per capita is lower, or by Srichan, Apidechkul, Tamornpark, Yeemard, Khunthason, Kitchanapaiboon, Wongnuch, Wongphaet, and Upala (2020) who have shown that the level of education, occupation or income is associated with how people experience social distancing during COVID-19. Important policy implications follow, especially when it is considered that higher-educated, higher-income or Asian people were able to work at home and maintain employment during COVID-19 due to their occupations as suggested in studies such as by Bick, Blandin, and Mertens (2020) or Dingel and Neiman (2020) , whereas lower-educated workers, blacks or Hispanics were not able to work at home due to their occupations and thus became unemployed as suggested in studies such as by Gupta, Montenovo, Nguyen, Rojas, Schmutte, Simon, Weinberg, and Wing (2020) or Yasenov (2020) . In particular, although higher-income, highereducated or Asian people have experienced higher social distancing after the declaration of National Emergency, since social interaction levels are similar across demographic groups after the declaration, redistributive e\u00a4ects of COVID-19 are implied due to di\u00a4erent demographic groups being or not being able to work at home. Accordingly, demographic-group speci\u2026c policies are required to reduce not only the overall economic impact of COVID-19 but also the corresponding inequality across demographic groups.",

This is a state-level data set of mobility covering information on demographic groups of income, education and race/ethnicity. The social interaction is based on PlaceIQ data that are used to construct a device exposure index (DEX). Given that a smartphone is observed at a particular commercial venue on a particular day, DEX measures the number of distinct devices that visit the same commercial venue on the same day. In order to focus on devices of which movements can be reliably characterized (particularly after the onset of COVID-19), Couture, Dingel, Green, Handbury, and Kevin (2020) restricts the set of devices included in their DEX calculation to those that pinged on at least 11 days over any 14-day period starting from November 1, 2019. Commercial venues (about 900,000 of them) used in DEX calculations are those that are small enough such that visiting devices are indeed exposed to each other. The state-level DEX values (used in this paper) measure the average exposure of devices residing in a given U.S. state.",

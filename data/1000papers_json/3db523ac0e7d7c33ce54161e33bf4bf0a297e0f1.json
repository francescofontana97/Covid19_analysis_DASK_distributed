        "title": "Personal View Towards an accurate and systematic characterisation of persistently asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 People with persistently asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection experience no symptoms throughout the course of infection, and pre-symptomatic individuals become infectious days before they report symptoms. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from individuals without symptoms contributes to pandemic spread, but the extent of transmission from persistently asymptomatic individuals remains unknown. We describe three methodological issues that hinder attempts to estimate this proportion. First, incomplete symptom assessment probably overestimates the asymptomatic fraction. Second, studies with inadequate follow-up misclassify pre-symptomatic individuals. Third, serological studies might identify people with previously unrecognised infection, but reliance on poorly defined antibody responses and retrospective symptom assessment might result in misclassification. We provide recommendations regarding definitions, detection, documentation, and follow-up to improve the identification and evaluation of people with persistently asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their contacts. Accurate characterisation of the persistently asymptomatic fraction of infected individuals might shed light on COVID-19 pathogenesis and transmission dynamics, and inform public health responses",

Defining the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that is truly asymptomatic will help to better characterise the COVID-19 illness severity spectrum, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and immunity, and will inform control policies. Two systematic reviews that only included studies with sufficient time to exclude pre-symptomatic infection have estimated the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that remain completely free of symptoms to be 20% (95% CI 17-25%) 7 and 17% (95% CI 14-20%) . 8 The individual studies included in these reviews rarely estimated an asymptomatic fraction greater than 50%. The range of estimates of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in studies that used a wider variety of study designs goes from as low as 4% to more than 80% (table). 9, 10 There are three main reasons for ongoing confusion about the proportion of asymptomatic infections. First, investigators have not yet developed a consistent case definition, meaning that symptom assessments differ substantially between studies and over time, with minor or atypical symptoms almost certainly missed in the earliest descriptions of COVID-19. Second, crosssectional studies that assess symptoms at a single timepoint or studies with a short follow-up period might incorrectly categorise individuals as asymptomatic when they are actually pre-symptomatic or post-symptomatic. 21, 22 Third, the time course and durability of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response remain poorly understood, so there might be major limitations when using serological surveys, particularly when they are coupled with retrospective clinical history, to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections.",

Information extracted retrospectively from medical records or reports that rely on spontaneous reporting by study participants will probably underestimate the frequency of mild or atypical symptoms. In a cohort of 147 indi viduals diagnosed with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at homeless shelters in Boston, MA, USA, 129 (88%) were classified as asymptomatic when asked only about a narrow range of symptoms that included a history of cough and shortness of breath. 15 They were also invited to report other symp toms, a strategy that does not reliably capture a complete clinical picture. A large study of infections in Iceland considered only cough, fever, aches, and shortness of breath as symptoms compatible with COVID-19. 16 A report of individuals infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship omitted commonly reported symptoms, including anos mia and gastrointestinal complaints, which might have led to an overestimated asymptomatic proportion of 44% (311 of 712 participants). 11 Additionally, it is not clear how potential language barriers were addressed, since symptom assessment occurred in Japan from a pre sumably multi national and multilingual cohort. Other studies of the Diamond Princess out break have estimated different pro portions of asymptomatic infections, inclu ding a mode lling study that esti ma ted 17\u00b79% (credible inter val 15\u00b75-20\u00b72%) 29 and another study of the early phase of the outbreak that reported 14% (24 of 172 participants), 30 but only tested suspected cases (defined as those with fever or respiratory symptoms) that might have biased the outcome.

Among residents of a nursing home in the USA who were tested after a healthcare worker was found to be infected, 48 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 21 (44%) had symptoms and 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing. 17 Over the next 7 days, 24 (89%) of the initial 27 residents without symptoms developed symptoms and were therefore pre-symptomatic at the time of testing. 17 In South Korea, 110 (36%) of 303 individuals were initially asymptomatic at a clinical treatment centre, a setting designed for individuals with mild or no symptoms, and 21 (19%) of these 110 individuals eventually developed symptoms indicating a persistently asymptomatic fraction in this cohort of 29% (ie, 89 of 303 participants stayed asymptomatic) . 34 Three publications including pregnant women in New York City, NY, USA, show the importance of accurate reporting of symptoms and adequate follow-up. 14, 35, 36 The first report, 14 stating that \"29 of the 33 patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at admission (87\u00b79%) had no symptoms of COVID-19 at presentation\", had a median follow-up time of 2 days post-partum, an insufficient period to exclude pre-symptomatic infection. In fact, two subsequent publications, which had an overlapping cohort of obstetric patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and a longer follow-up, found that the proportion of asymptomatic women was much lower, including one study 35 in which just 46 (29%) of 158 participants remained asymptomatic throughout follow-up (63 [40%] were asymptomatic at diagnosis), and another study 36 with at least 2 weeks of follow-up time, in which four (9%) of 43 participants remained asymptomatic (12 [28%] were asymptomatic at diagnosis).",

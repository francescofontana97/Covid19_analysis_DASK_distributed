Because of severe side effects and only a 50-70% cure rate in genotype 1 HCV-infected patients upon current standard treatment with pegylated interferon-a plus ribavirin, new therapeutic regimens are still needed. San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang (SHXT) is a transitional Chinese herbal formula, composed of Rhei rhizoma, Scutellaria radix and Coptidis rhizome, and possesses anti-inflammatory effect. Here, we describe a (+)-catechin-containing fraction extracted from SHXT, referred as SHXT-frC, exhibited effective inhibition of HCV replication, with selectivity index value (SI; CC 50 /EC 50 ) of 84, and displayed synergistic anti-HCV effects when combined with interferon-a, HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir or polymerase inhibitor 2\u00a2-C-methylcytidine. The activation of factor-jB (NF-jB) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) signalling pathway has particular relevance to HCV-associated HCC.

It has a 9.6-kb genome encoding a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved by both the host and virus proteases into at least 10 mature individual proteins: four structural proteins (C, E1, E2 and p7) and six nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) [4] . Among the latter, NS5A promotes improper upregulation of hepatic nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-jB) and the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) signalling pathway, leading to chronic inflammation or proliferation of hepatoma cells [5] [6] [7] . COX-2 is an inducible enzyme involved in the production of various prostaglandins (PGs) upon exposure to multiple stimuli such as viral and bacterial products including lipopolysaccharides, cytokines, oncogenes, mitogens and growth factors [8] . However, aberrant upregulation of COX-2 expression contributes to the progress of hepatic carcinogenesis because elevated PG concentrations promote cell proliferation, survival and inhibition of the pro-apoptosis pathway, ultimately resulting in tumour formation [8] . Recently, various studies have reported that elevated COX-2 protein levels favour increased HCV replication, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated [7, 9, 10] . On the basis of these findings, an attractive means of minimizing the HCV-related liver malignancy is by eliminating the NF-jB-COX-2-dependent signalling pathway for simultaneously reducing viral infection and hepatocarcinogenesis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 132, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 412, "end": 415, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 647, "end": 650, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 651, "end": 654, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 655, "end": 658, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 901, "end": 904, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1173, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1342, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1345, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1346, "end": 1349, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang (SHXT) is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine formula composed of Rhei rhizoma (Rheum officinale Baill), Scutellaria radix (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and Coptidis rhizome (Coptis chinensis Franch).

NF-jB activation is one of the most ubiquitous mediators of COX-2 activation in a viral infection [38] . Therefore, we performed a promoter-based assay to determine whether the suppression of COX-2 was related to the modulation of transcription factor NF-jB upon SHXT-frC treatment. Ava5 and Huh-7 cells were transiently transfected with the cis-reporting plasmid pNF-jB-Luc, following which the transfected cells were incubated with or without SHXT-frC for 3 days. As shown in Fig. 3 , the luciferase activity assay revealed that SHXT-frC significantly inhibited NF-jB-mediated transcriptional activity in a concentration-dependent manner (white bars), which supports the possibility that the suppression of NF-jB may be involved in the anti-COX-2 effect of SHXT-frC.

To examine whether SHXT-frC was able to block NS5A-induced COX-2 expression for the prevention of hepatocarcinogenesis, an NS5A expression vector (pCMV-NS5A-Myc) was cotransfected with the COX-2 reporter vector (pCOX-2-Luc) into the parental Huh-7 cells in the absence and presence of SHXT-frC or (+)-catechin, in which transfection of pCOX-2-Luc alone was served as basal promoter activity of COX-2.

There are multiple scoring systems in use to identify patients at risk for developing pancreatic necrosis and/or persistent organ failure, but these scoring systems largely incorporate variables collected over 24 to 48 hours of hospital admission. 1, [8] [9] [10] Recently, a scoring system incorporating the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), hypoxemia, and age has been proposed as a prognostic tool in patients with acute pancreatitis for use in the emergency room at the time of presentation, and may allow for early identification of severe acute pancreatitis. 11 The presence of SIRS heralds the activation of complex inflammatory pathways that cause pancreatic necrosis and persistent organ failure, the most frequent and serious being respiratory failure. 12 In one prospective study of patients with acute pancreatitis (n = 252), all cases of pancreatic necrosis, death, and nearly all cases of persistent organ failure, developed SIRS during the first day of hospitalization. 13 The presence of hypoxemia has been noted to have a direct correlation with the development of respiratory failure and mortality in acute pancreatitis. In a prospective study of 60 patients referred to a tertiary care center, mild hypoxemia (PaO 2 , 60-80 mm Hg) was observed in 29 patients and severe hypoxemia (PaO 2 <60 mm Hg) in 11 patients, the presence of either being associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and an increased risk for mortality. 14 The presence of SIRS and hypoxemia may identify patients early in the course of acute pancreatitis who would benefit from a treatment to target the development of both complications.",

[15] [16] [17] Overactivity of CRAC channels appears to play a proximal role in injuring pancreatic acinar cells, ductal cells, and stellate cells. In the acinar cell, the sustained influx of calcium damages mitochondria and converts trypsinogen to trypsin intracellularly, which together increase the risk of pancreatic necrosis. 4, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] The CRAC channels initiate the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines from T cells, contributing to the systemic inflammation and respiratory failure that occurs in acute pancreatitis. [15] [16] [17] It has also been suggested that CRAC channels directly contribute to respiratory failure by activating pulmonary endothelial cells, causing breakdown of the alveolar-capillary barrier, extravasation of fluid into the alveoli, and the development of hypoxemia. [15] [16] [17] 23 Thus, inhibition of CRAC channels may be beneficial in reducing the frequency and severity of both respiratory failure and pancreatic necrosis in patients with acute pancreatitis.",

Eligible patients were adults with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis established by the presence of abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis and 1 of the following 2 criteria: a serum lipase or serum amylase more than 3 times the upper limit normal or characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on abdominal imaging. In addition, patients were required to have a diagnosis of SIRS and hypoxemia (full details in the Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MPA/A863). Patients were not eligible if they had evidence of pancreatic necrosis on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) performed in the 18 hours prior to consent or after consent and before day 1. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the Supplemental Digital Content (http://links.lww.com/MPA/A863). An institutional review board at each site approved the trial protocol.

After review of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety data from cohorts 1 and 2 by both CalciMedica, Inc.

In addition, patients receiving Auxora experienced less persistent SIRS and more rapid restoration of gut function than patients receiving standard of care alone, allowing for better tolerability of solid foods within 72 hours of treatment, and earlier hospital discharge. This allowed for reduced median hospital stay in the Auxora treatment groups compared with those receiving standard of care, especially among patients with moderate or severe acute pancreatitis noted on Screening CECTs.",

            "text": "The fast-acting nature of Auxora, which was, on average, administered within 24 hours of onset of symptoms, is of particular importance as it is critical to treat the inflammatory response associated with acute pancreatitis quickly to prevent persistent organ failure and SIRS, thereby decreasing the risk of mortality. 13, 25 Several studies have shown that in patients with acute pancreatitis, proinflammatory responses resulting in pancreatic inflammation, organ failure, and SIRS often occurs early in disease progression and may occur independently or together, suggesting the activation of complex inflammatory pathways. 13, 29 In a prospective study of patients with acute pancreatitis, SIRS occurred in 155 (62%) patients on day 1 of hospitalization and was predictive of severe disease. In this study, all patients developing SIRS experienced at least 1 of the following: pancreatic necrosis, multisystem organ failure, or death, and 85% of persistent organ failure cases occurred in these patients. 13 In a separate study of patient with acute pancreatitis and persistent organ failure (n = 601), 370 (61.6%) had an onset of persistent organ failure less than 24 hours after hospitalization, followed by 159 (26.5%) on day 2 and 40 (6.7%) on day 3. 29 In this trial of patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS and hypoxemia, those receiving Auxora saw reductions in the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, with treatment. When elevated, IL-6 is often associated with worsening severity of acute pancreatitis. 30 These improvements in proinflammatory cytokine levels with the infusion of Auxora suggest an immediate impact on systemic inflammation in patients with acute pancreatitis, which is key to reducing the risk of severe disease and mortality. In addition, animal models have shown the ability of CRAC channel inhibitors like Auxora to attenuate cell death responses to toxic stimuli in pancreatic acinar cells, ameliorate acute pancreatitis severity, stabilize pulmonary endothelial cells, as well as block the release of proinflammatory cytokines. 17, 19, 20 Given the direct effects on pancreatic acinar cells, pulmonary endothelium, and immune cells associated with proinflammatory cytokine production and release, Auxora may be an appropriate therapy for the management of patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS plus hypoxemia. Furthermore, Auxora has demonstrated rapid distribution to the pancreas and lungs, resulting in a fast onset of action (data not shown), and thereby, effective inhibition of CRAC channels in pancreatic and pulmonary tissue.",

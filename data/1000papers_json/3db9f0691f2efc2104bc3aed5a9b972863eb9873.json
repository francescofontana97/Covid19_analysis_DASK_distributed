Nine jurisdictions are considered based on their Islamic banks' systemic importance, namely Bahrain, Brunei, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and UAE. Using the bivariate VARX model, our forecasting exercise shows that the Islamic banks' response to the COVID-19 pandemic is not uniform across jurisdictions. While the Islamic banks' dynamics in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait are less likely to be impaired, Bahrain, Brunei, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Turkey are expected to be relatively more affected especially in terms of their size growth. Saudi Arabia will continue leading the growth momentum of the global Islamic banking sector, and its Islamic banks' assets are expected to reach at least $185.4 billion by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. This paper recommends a prioritization approach for the implementation of the policy measures by the jurisdictions based on their banks-specific responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

More than 75 countries have reported positive cases of COVID-19 as the virus is spread globally, affecting communities, ecosystems, and supply chains all over the world [7] . Governments have focused on containing the virus by adopting strict procedures such as social distancing, lockdowns, and quarantines, which have led to an economic downturn. Lockdowns of cities, border closures, and various health measures have been implemented in over 136 countries [79] , to slow and stop the pandemic. However, the policies adopted by governments engendered economic recession around the world [14] , and quickly spread to financial markets [67] , Zhang et al. [83] . The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted these consequences because the global gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate is expected to decrease by 3% during 2020, which may have a negative impact on the banking sector [41] . This implies that financial institutions are most likely to be vulnerable in times of economic downturn, due to the likelihood of nonperforming financings [33] .",

            "text": "Intuitively, the effect of the pandemic on the global economy is already devastating, while it presents the most significant shock to the financial system since the GFC [39, 41] . Furthermore, weakened production and economic activity due to movement restriction orders have resulted in weakening the global demand for oil. The situation has then (has) been aggravated by the failure of the OPEC + coalition to agree on a deal to cut outputs. Consequently, the combined effects of the COVID-19 and oil price volatility shocks, as well as the pre-existing conditions of financial vulnerability in jurisdictions where Islamic finance is practiced, will put the resilience of the Islamic banks to test in 2020 and perhaps beyond [39] . In comparison with the conventional banking sector, Islamic banks are highly exposed to the real economy. Therefore, they are expected to record declined revenue, high pressure on earnings, and lower growth in 2020 especially as the focus will be on preserving asset quality at the expense of business growth [39] . In addition, increased pressure on liquidity position is also expected due to the mandatory postponement of repayment of existing financing extended to especially the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and households in many jurisdictions where Islamic banking is practiced. In this regard, the study of banks' response to the COVID-19 pandemic becomes of a paramount importance as it will be needed to come up with the appropriate policy measures to ensure the growth and stability of the banking system. This paper examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Islamic banks at the aggregate level. More precisely, it aims to assess the variation of Islamic banks' dynamics, namely size, profitability, nonperforming financings, and stability, subject to IMF forecasted GDP growth by country. Based on data availability, nine jurisdictions are considered in this paper, namely Bahrain, Brunei, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and UAE. The bank-specific variables are retrieved from the Prudential and Structural Islamic Financial Indicators database (PSI-FIs) for the period ranging from 2013Q4 to 2019Q3. 2 The GDP growth dataset is derived from IMF World economic outlook [80] . Although the IMF considers the COVID-19 shock when forecasting the yearly GDP growth by country until 2021, we convert the forecasted annual growth rates into quarterly growth rates.",

The findings of the forecast exercise show interesting implications in terms of the Islamic banks' response across jurisdictions, enabling us to come up with valuable recommendations for policymakers and regulators with the aim to ensure the stability and the continuous growth of the Islamic banking industry. Our findings show that the impact of COVID-19 is not uniform across jurisdictions. More precisely, the Islamic banks in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait are expected to continue increasing in terms of size, a slight volatility in nonperforming financing and profitability. In contrast, the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) will remain above the minimum required by Basel III. Similarly, the forecast results indicate that Islamic banks' assets are most likely to be more volatile for Bahrain, Brunei, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Turkey, which can harm their corresponding growth prospects. Furthermore, the capital adequacy ratio, nonperforming financing, and profitability are expected to be volatile during the forecast period. Different results are found when examining the response of Islamic banks in Indonesia to COVID-19 shock. The results indicate that Islamic banks' in this jurisdiction are expected to face higher volatility in size, besides a besides a more sever deterioration in nonperforming financing and profitability, engendering some instability to the banking system during the forecast period. Based on the aforementioned results, a set of recommendations will be provided under the form of policy measures to deal with the risks encountered by the Islamic banking system during this crucial economic situation.",

The authors considered a sample of 100 commercial banks including 50 Islamic commercial banks and 50 conventional commercial banks from 13 countries, for the period ranging from 2009 to 2015. With regard to net worth risk for increasing benchmark rate, results showed that the Islamic commercial banks are 2.15 times more vulnerable compared to the conventional commercial banks. Furthermore, it was found that a significant number of the Islamic commercial banks failed the stress test of the 20% threshold prescribed by the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB). As a result of higher duration gap, Chatta and Alhabashi [22] indicated that the Islamic commercial banks are vulnerable to a significant loss of net worth under an increasing benchmark rate regime in dual banking systems.",

The first stage consists of calculating the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of the Islamic commercial banks using the IFSB formula, depending on how the profit-sharing investment accounts (PSIAs) are treated in the respective jurisdiction. The second stage is the application of the stress scenarios and shocks. Results justified the sensitivity of CAR of Islamic commercial banks.

In terms of profitability, results showed that Islamic banks in Indonesia are immune from losses when the nonperforming loan (the default rate) is less than 8.5%. In terms of capital position, the authors revealed that the industry is less likely to bankrupt when the probability of default (PD) is less than 9%. However, when the probability of default exceeds 9%, the total expected loss becomes higher than the available capital. Furthermore, Kurniadi et al.

This implies that understanding the differences in business models, and the interaction between solvency and liquidity conditions are crucial to ensure the stability of the financial system [43] . Intuitively, [43] suggested that more emphasis on qualitative analysis to understand the reputational risk of individual institutions, the competitive environment for an accurate assessment of Islamic banks' resilience in distress situations is needed.",

Results revealed that most of the standard CAMELS indicators are relevant for examining distress in Islamic banks.

The selection of jurisdictions depends on their total shares of global Islamic assets and data availability and usefulness. Therefore, nine countries are chosen in this study, namely Bahrain, Brunei, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and UAE. Following the studies by Artesis and Jia [11] , Kucukkocaoglu and Altintas [49] , Pati [65] , Kurniadi et al.

According to the aforementioned studies, NPF and CAR can be used as proxies for the default and stability, respectively. The GDPG is employed as a macroeconomic proxy because it captures the economic growth over time. In the case of economic downturn, the GDPG is most likely to experience a decrease. This decrease will significantly affect household and SMEs, engendering an increase of nonperforming financings (NPF). The increase of (NPF) will also lead to a decrease of the banks' profitability and the deterioration of the capital adequacy ratio. In this situation, ensuring banks' resilience becomes critical [22] . While the variable SIZE captures possible scale effects across jurisdictions, the variable ROA reflects banks' profitability.",

Similarly, it is shown that Saudi Arabia and Malaysia have the highest size explained in terms of the natural logarithm of total assets, whereas Brunei and Indonesia have the lowest values. This evidence reveals that Saudi Arabia and Malaysia are considered systematically important comparing to the jurisdictions having lower size. Table 2 also shows that Islamic banks in Bahrain and UAE are characterized by higher NPF ratios, whereas Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Malaysia have the lowest values in mean. Intuitively, a higher NPF may reflect higher probability of default because, in most jurisdictions, almost 50% of total Islamic financing is devoted to household financing [38] . This higher concentration may cause higher risk of default when economic situations become more severe due to the lack of diversification. The quarterly GDPG is characterized by an excessive variation across all jurisdiction, while the gap between the maximum and minimum values is large. This gap is explained in terms of standard deviation defining the excessive volatility of GDPG during the examined period. Figure 1 illustrates the variation of GDPG from 2013Q4 to 2021Q4 based on IMF World Economic Outlook [42] . Admitting that IMF provides a yearly data by country, Fig. 1 illustrates the variation of the quarterly GDPG during the examined period, whereas further details about its calculation are provided in the next section. Figure 1 shows that the quarterly GDPG is expected to decrease for all jurisdictions during 2020, which is mostly attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Global economy. By considering rigorous procedures such as social distancing, lockdowns, and quarantines, the virus can be contained [80] . Nevertheless, several economic issues emerge affecting various sectors, namely travel, hospitality, and international trades among others [29] . The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy motivates us to forecast Islamic banks' dynamics during this critical period and provide further explanations for regulators and policy makers to ensure the resilience of the Islamic banking sector.",

To perform the forecasting exercise, the data need to be extended from 2019Q4 to 2021Q4, which is the forecast period. Although the variable GDPG is forecasted until 2021Q4 [42], Islamic banks' dynamics need to be forecasted, subject to their own lagged values and the current value of the GDPG. After visualizing the data, the bivariate VARX models are specified, by defining one bank-specific variable as endogenous, whereas the GDPG is inserted as exogenous.",

The U-shaped form indicates that the Islamic banks' size in these jurisdictions is expected to experience a sharp decrease during the first few quarters of the forecast period, remain quasi-stable, and start to increase over the last quarters of the forecast period. While this is clearly observed for Indonesia and Malaysia, the Pakistani case is characterized by a longer decrease over the first few quarters, followed by an increase over the remaining quarters. The three countries reach the lowest size in 2021Q1 with assets values equal to $1.92 trillion, $137.3 trillion, and $9.2 trillion for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan, respectively. However, Indonesia will recover to reach a value of $29.5 billion, indicating the highest quarterly growth rate in 2021Q4 (329.12%), and the highest compound quarterly growth rate (CQGR) among the three countries amounting to 2.86% over the two-year forecast period. \u2022 Inverted U-shaped form: Bahrain seems to be the only country that follows this form. Indeed, the size of Bahraini Islamic banks is expected to behave according to an upward-monotonic trend until a maximum value of $65.8 billion is reached by the end of 2021Q1, after which a decline is expected to occur to reach the lowest value of $62.7 billion by 2021Q4. \u2022 Increasing form: The size of Islamic banks of three countries follows this form, namely Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and UAE. The size of Islamic banks in these countries follows the same increasing trend over 2020 and 2021. The Islamic banks' assets of three GCC countries have two main common facts. On the first side, all countries have positive quarterly growth rates during the two-year forecast period. On the other side, the quarterly growth rates will continue a decreasing trend during the second year Fig. 2c . Kuwait is the least impaired country, followed by Saudi Arabia and UAE, respectively. Indeed, Fig. 2b shows that the Kuwaiti, Saudi, and Emirati Islamic banks' assets are expected to increase by $12.4 billion, $9.9 billion, and $7.7 billion, respectively, during the two-year forecast period. This can be further confirmed by the compound quarterly growth rates (CQGR) of these three countries that amount to Fig. 2a shows that the logged total assets are expected to decrease at a negative slope during 2020 and will continue decreasing with a more negative slope during 2021. Figure 2b shows the fluctuations of total assets and indicate that they are expected to decrease from $7.4 billion in 2019Q4 to $7.1 in 2020Q4, which characterizes the concave aspect of this form. The year 2021 is characterized by a sharp decrease in the total assets since their forecasted value is expected to amount to $6.2 billion by the end of the forecasting period. The quarterly growth rates are all expected to be negative during the forecast period and the worst growth rate corresponds to the last quarter 2021Q4 (\u22125.28%). \u2022 L-form: Turkey is the sole country that is expected to behave according to this form. The total assets of Turkish Islamic banks are expected to decline suddenly from $45.574 billion in 2019Q3 to $41.528 in 2020Q3. After this decline, the total assets will get stabilized until the end of the forecasting period without falling below $41 billion.",

This can be clearly seen for Indonesia for which the ROA declines from the observed value of 1.15% in 2019Q3 to the forecasted value of -3.91% in 2020Q3. Afterward, the forecasted values start to increase to reach the maximum value of 5.62% in 2021Q4.

Indonesia is the most impaired country as the ROA reaches the forecasted value of \u22124.02% in 2020Q4 at the bottom of its U-shaped form, which is lower than the minimum value over the historical period of 2013Q4-2019Q3, which is equal to 0.51%. Similarly, the ROA of Malaysia's Islamic banks is expected to reach 0.92% in 2020Q3, which is lower than the minimum historical value of 0.95% that was recorded in 2016Q3. The impairing impact of COVID-19 does not seem to lower the expected ROA below the historical profitability for the remaining countries. The countries in Southeast Asia, expect for Brunei, are more vulnerable to the deterioration of their profitability in comparison with the Middle Eastern countries. Our evidence indicates that the profitability of Islamic banks is less likely to be linked with the degree of systemic importance of the Islamic banking sector in the jurisdictions under consideration. Indeed, the shares of Indonesia and Turkey's Islamic banking assets at the global level are very close and equal to 5% by 2018. In addition, their respective local shares of Islamic banking assets amount to 1.9% and 2.6%, respectively, as reported by IFSB [38] . Although Turkey and Indonesia have very similar shares of Islamic banking assets at both the global and local levels, the response of their Islamic banks' profitability does not seem to be qualitative. The example of Saudi Arabia and Brunei is also typical in this case since both countries have systemically important Islamic banking sectors with shares equal to 62% and 68%, respectively. However, the ROA of their Islamic banks responds differently to the COVID-19 pandemic. This may probably be attributed to the leading role of Saudi Arabia in the global Islamic banking sector with a share of 20% vs. 0.5% for Brunei. Figure 4 provides a forecast of Islamic banks' NPF for the period ranging from 2019Q4 to 2021Q4. The results indicate that Islamic banks' forecasted NPF exhibits two main forms: Overall, our results indicate that the shock of COVID-19 does not affect the NPF similarly for all jurisdictions. Prior to experiencing the most successful recovery by the end of the forecasting period, Indonesia is the most impaired country because the corresponding NPF reaches the maximum forecasted value of 20.29% in 2020Q2 among all countries that follow the inverted U-shaped form. Interestingly, the impairing impact of COVID-19 does not seem to exceed the expected NPFs above the historical values for all countries except Indonesia and Malaysia. This evidence implies that Southeast Asian countries, except Brunei, are the most vulnerable to the deterioration of their NPF in comparison with the Middle Eastern countries because their forecasted NPFs surpassed significantly the historical performance. For example, the Malaysian Islamic banks' NPF reached a maximum historical value of 1.61% in 2019Q3 and a maximum forecasted value of 2% in 2020Q3.",

On the second hand, Brunei's CAR values did not decrease below the last observation of 2019Q3 and continued to grow at a decreasing rate until the last quarter. However, Saudi Arabia is expected to be characterized by the highest CAR during 2020Q4 with a value equal to 21.7%. This fact stems from the sizeable Islamic banks' assets in comparison with the other countries in the sample. As for Brunei, the quasi-stability of CAR can hypothetically be explained in terms of a low proportion of the Islamic banks' assets that are subject to Basel III's weighting. In other words, the proportion of risk-free assets (cash and riskless investments) is historically high and is expected to decline.",

It is found that our models do not exhibit autocorrelation issues since the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at 5% level of statistical significance. More precisely, it is revealed that the Rao F-stat has a p value higher than 5% for all models, indicating that our results do not suffer from autocorrelation effects. Similarly, Table 6 shows the stability diagnostic test for our models. This test assumes that VARX model satisfies the stability conditions if no root lies outside the unit circle, which is equal to the unity. Across all jurisdictions, the results indicate that all roots are less than unity except for Brunei when forecasting their respective Islamic banks' size. In this regard, it is clear that all models are stable for all jurisdictions except probably for (Size, GDPG) models for Brunei.",

Various forms of shapes have been found Note The Rao F test investigates the existence of autocorrelation in our models. Null hypothesis: There is no autocorrelation. According to [68] , the null hypothesis is rejected when the p value of the Roa F-stat is higher than 5%. Our results prove that our models do not suffer from autocorrelation issues because the Roa F-stat's p value is higher than 5% for all jurisdictions is expected to exhibit either the U-shaped or the inverted U-shaped forms. Brunei has the same feature but is characterized by the downward concave shape that is expected to occur in the cases of size and stability. \u2022 The two GCC countries Saudi Arabia and UAE are expected to behave according to the same fashion. The Islamic banks' dynamics size, nonperforming financing, and stability are expected to exhibit the same forms. The profitability of Emirati Islamic banks is, however, more rapid to recover than that of its Saudi peers. \u2022 The two GCC countries, Bahrain and Kuwait, are expected to behave according to the same fashion. The Islamic banks' dynamics, profitability, nonperforming, and stability are expected to exhibit the same forms, as shown in Table 7 . However, the size of Kuwaiti Islamic banks is expected to gain a momentum of growth and the size of Bahraini Islamic banks will increase without building the same growth momentum since it will start to decrease from 2021Q1 without going below $11 billion though. \u2022 The four GCC countries in our sample share a common fact regarding their size.

Consequently, the global GDP will most likely experience a severe downward trend during the current year, which may cause several issues at the microeconomic and macroeconomic levels. Using a VARX model, Islamic banks' dynamics, namely size, profitability, nonperforming financing, and capital adequacy ratio, are forecasted, subject to the forecasted GDP growth by jurisdiction over the period ranging from 2019Q4 to 2021Q4. Our findings show that the GCC countries, in particular Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and UAE, are expected to remain stable during the forecast period. This implies that further focus must be given to the development side, while the stability side is ensured. In contrast, the remaining jurisdictions are more likely to be affected, which indicates that further policies need to be implemented to ensure the stability of the Islamic banking system during this critical period. Our results further show that Islamic banks in Indonesia are the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic shock, implying that additional liquidity needs to be injected to maintain higher capital adequacy ratio besides the reinforcement of the nonperforming financings provision.",

The limited sample size constitutes the most salient limitation. This paper can be extended by considering additional indicators such as total shari'ah-compliant financings and alternative stability indicators across jurisdictions.",

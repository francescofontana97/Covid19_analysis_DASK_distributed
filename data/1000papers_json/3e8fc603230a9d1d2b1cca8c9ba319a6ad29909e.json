Hence, their use is necessary for food security and animal welfare. However, overuse and misuse of antimicrobials has been associated with the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), threatening both human and animal health, food security, and sustainable development [1] . In recent years, the impact of the use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals has been the subject of public debates, and the World Organization for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties, OIE) has highlighted the need to regulate antimicrobial use in order to prevent the emergence and spread of resistant organisms in humans and animals and into the environment [2] . A Trop. Med. Infect. Dis. 2021, 6, 73 2 of 9 systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2017 showed that interventions that restricted antibiotic use in food-producing animals were associated with a reduction in antibiotic-resistant bacteria in these animals and in turn reduced the potential for resistance in human populations, especially those who are in direct exposure to such food-producing animals [3] .",

As part of this reporting framework, the community animal health workers (who are veterinary paraprofessionals working at chiefdom level) are expected to collect data on a weekly basis from the chiefdoms (sub-district level units) and submit these to the district livestock officers, who are then expected to compile the reports on a monthly basis and submit them at the national level.

It contributes to over 75% of livelihoods and about 47% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Livestock agriculture contributes to about 6% of the total GDP [6] . The main livestock species for local meat production are cattle, goats, sheep, poultry, and pigs. More than 90% of these animals are indigenous. According to a survey conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2016, livestock estimates were 245,736 cattle, 963,001 sheep, 1,567,789 goats, 125,064 pigs and 14,721,718 poultry [6] .

Therefore, the data presented are the duplicates of district treatment forms found at the district level.

If the total number of animals treated in the district treatment form for a given month matched with the sum of all the animals treated in each of the sub-district treatment forms for the corresponding month, then the data were considered complete. We also performed a qualitative document analysis of district treatment forms and identified missing variables and data inconsistencies.

Of the 14 districts, 11 (79%) districts did not have any forms available from the study period. The three districts that had forms available were Kenema (one form, 2017), Kambia (two forms, 2019), and Bombali (three forms, 2017), which is substantially lower than the total number of forms expected (n = 44) from each of the districts during the study period. Thus, of 616 forms expected in total during the study period, only 6 (0.97%) were available. We also reviewed the sub-district treatment forms used by the community animal health workers to capture data from their respective chiefdoms, and the results are shown in Table 2 . These forms were not present in 11 out of 14 (79%) districts. Only three districts (Kenema, Kambia, and Bombali) had these forms available, the number of which was far below that expected. Thus, of 6840 sub-district forms expected in total during the study period, only 79 (1.15%) were available. Comparing the district and sub-district treatment forms, we found that the data in the two forms were all discordant and, because of this reason, we could not assess the completeness of the data reported. A qualitative document analysis of district treatment forms showed that the name of the reporting officer and the phone number of the animal owner were consistently absent in all of the forms. All the other fields, such as the name of the animal, clinical diagnosis, and treatment, were filled consistently. As per the information available in the six district treatment forms, a total of 77 animals were treated. Some of the most common antibiotics used were tetracycline (used 5 animals), oxytetracycline (used in 13 animals), tylosin (used in 7 animals), and sulfadimidine (used in 3 animals). The other common medicines provided were ivermectin (used in 29 animals), multivitamin tablets (used in 35 animals), oral rehydration salts (used in 3 animals), and oxytocin injection (used in 6 animals). The dose of the drugs given was not consistently mentioned. The duration of the treatment was not mentioned in any of the forms. The \"remarks\" column was either not filled or filled variably; while some forms mentioned \"recovered\" indicating the outcome of treatment, others simply mentioned \"treated\".",

This study was carried out with difficulty and encountering many logistic challenges, such as COVID-19 domestic traveling restrictions, limited district accessibility, unavailability of livestock officers at the district sites, and erratic storage of the paper-based forms. Another limitation of our study is that we focused on the antimicrobial use and reporting in the government sector but not in the private sector. The private sector accounts for~85% of all antimicrobials procured and used in Sierra Leone, and this procurement process is not regulated by the government. Future studies should make efforts to collect data on sales at drug stores, which may give a better picture of the overall consumption of antimicrobials in the country.",

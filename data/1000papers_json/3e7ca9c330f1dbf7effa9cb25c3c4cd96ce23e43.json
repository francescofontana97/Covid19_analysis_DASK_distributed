This paper aims to develop a stepwise protocol for the dental management of geriatric patients.",

The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 recognises the host cell receptors and fuses with the cell membranes before gaining admission in oral mucosa, tongue and salivary glands. 28 Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have higher viral loads in the saliva, oropharynx, nasal passages and upper respiratory tract. 29 Poor oral hygiene can increase the risk of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death in COVID positive geriatric patients. 30 It is found that the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio at an early stage of COVID-19 predicts patients who are likely to develop critical illness. 31 Patients in ICU exhibit an exceptionally high bacterial load. Thus, it is obligatory to check the modifiable risk factors such as diet, poor oral hygiene and overall glycemic control.

A critical step to reduce the salivary viral load is by enforcing the practice of preprocedural rinse with Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) in patients. 50, 51 Studies have shown that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were highly susceptible to PVP-I mouth rinse. Therefore, preprocedural mouth rinses with 0.2% povidone-iodine might reduce the load of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. [52] [53] [54] Alternatively, the use of 0.5%-1% hydrogen peroxide mouth rinses has demonstrated non-specific virucidal activity against coronaviruses. However, one has to use hydrogen peroxide judiciously in geriatric patients. Hydrogen peroxide is a highly caustic and a reactive substance, which can damage oral soft tissues when used in high concentrations and for a prolonged duration. 55 It is necessary to minimise intraoral imaging as patients tend to elicit a gag or cough reflex. When intraoral imaging is mandated, sensors should have a double barrier to prevent perforation and cross-contamination. 56 Latex finger cots used in conjunction with the standard plastic sheaths covering direct digital radiography (DDR) sensors may effectively prevent cross-contamination than plastic sheaths alone. However, dentists are recommended to use extraoral imaging, such as panoramic radiography or cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). It is also necessary to disinfect the radiograph holders and machine heads after each patient.",

As per WHO (2020) and OSHA recommendations, the patients should be transferred to a safer room with negative pressure ventilation and with 12 air changes/hour \"ACH\" or 160 L/s/patient. 60 The same protocol is recommended for emergency treatment of geriatric patients who test positive for COVID-19. It is strongly recommended that an anti-retraction dental handpiece is used with specially designed anti-retractive valves or other anti-reflux designs as a preventive measure for cross-infection. 61, 62 When indicated, dentists must place rubber dams to minimise splatter generation and aspiration of viral particles from the oral cavity to nasopharynx. It is also necessary to use high volume evacuators (HVE) while performing any dental procedure.",

In this paper, we have proposed generic protocols and stepwise guidelines for the effective management of geriatric patients in a dental setting. Universal guidelines to specifically meet the challenges of geriatric patients in the dental setting ensure the health of vulnerable sections of the society and the well-being of the community at large.

High-speed handpieces for cavity and tooth preparation, and 3-way syringes, are discouraged to reduce the risk of contamination of air and water tubes within the dental units and to prevent cross-infection. A dentist should perform an atraumatic restorative technique (ART) procedure using hand instruments instead of conventional rotary instruments to avoid generating aerosol. Dentists can also explore alternative means for removing decay on teeth employing chemico-mechanical means like CariSolv. Apart from eliminating the generation of aerosol or aspiration of viral particles, this technique ensures that only the carious dentine is removed without removing sound dentine.59 If root canal treatment (RCT) has to be performed, manual preparation of the root canal is preferred over rotary techniques. To reduce the older adults' visits to the clinic, it may be worth considering a single visit RCT.",

In multicenter European studies by Leichein et al, (2020)33 and Passali andBentivoglio (2020),34 it was reported that 85.6% of COVID-19 patients presented with olfactory and gustatory dysfunction, before the appearance of other symptoms. These symptoms generally appeared between 2 and 14 days after exposure to the virus. Around 80% of infected patients had mild symptoms and recovered from the disease without requiring hospital treatment. One in five people developed serious illness necessitating medical assistance. The majority of patients who required hospitalisation were older adults.Thus, it is crucial to record even the mildest symptoms during clinical examination and record temperature and travel history.Apart from the signs and symptoms mentioned above, geriatric patients might present with severe difficulty in breathing, bluish lips, confused state of mind, persistent pressure on the chest and inability to stay awake. There have been reports of SARS-CoV-2 patients presenting with myalgia, encephalopathy, encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and Guillain-Barre syndrome.35,36 Mao et al, (2020) 37 observed that, among patients who experienced neurological symptoms, 36%were mostly older adults. Additionally, patients with severe infection",

For surgical procedures requiring suturing, it is recommended to use a resorbable suture lasting 3-5 days in the oral cavity to eliminate the need for a follow-up appointment.Geriatric individuals who are fully or partially edentulous may have a removable or fixed intraoral prosthesis. Removing and maintaining the hygiene of these prostheses, in general, improves the well-being of the patient. Unfortunately, institutionalised elderly often neglect oral care because of frailty, which impacts oral health.For prosthetic procedures, it is advised to evaluate the urgency of the treatment before scheduling an appointment. If the patient's existing denture is broken or a fixed prosthesis is dislodged, it should be disinfected before the dentist or the technician handles it. It is necessary to plan a treatment that requires fewest appointments. It is advisable to prepare for an immediate denture if the extraction of teeth is planned. One could even explore the possibility of immediate implant placement with temporisation after removal of the tooth on the same day.Rational and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including head cap and mouth masks with a timely change in attitude, perception and behavioural change among healthcare workers, is the key to reducing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The PPE advocated for airborne agents (ie aerosol-transmissible) is different from the PPE used to prevent transmission by large droplets or direct contact. For the dentist and staff working in areas of direct contact with aerosols, recommended PPEs include R/P95, N/R/P99 or N/R/P100 filtering facepiece respirator; an air-purifying elastomeric (eg half-face or full-face) respirator with appropriate filters or cartridges; powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) with high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter; or supplied-air respirator (SAR).32",

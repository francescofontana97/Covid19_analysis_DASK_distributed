Abstract Background: Individuals infected by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have experienced different psychiatric manifestations during the period of infectivity and post-COVID-19 infection. Fatigue and anhedonia are among the frequently reported manifestations after recovery from this novel viral pandemic, leading to early evaluation of those patients and proper management of their complaints which have a drastic burden on different domains of life. Also, the period after recovery might have an effect on the severity of these two psychiatric presentations. Aim of the work: This cross-sectional observational study aimed to investigate the occurrence of post-COVID-19 fatigue and anhedonia and whether the duration after 2 consecutive PCR-negative tests has an implication on the severity of the abovementioned psychiatric manifestations. Methods: Socio-demographic characteristics of 200 post-COVID-19 patients were collected, and also, the self-assessment anhedonia scale was used to evaluate the degree of anhedonia. Fatigue assessment scale used to investigate this domain. The study targeted to find a possible correlation between the period after recovery and the other variables including anhedonia and fatigue.",

World Health Organization 2 declared until the end of May 2020, there were over 5.5 million confirmed cases of people who have been infected with COVID-19 worldwide and over 353 000 death cases. Xiang et al 9 highlighted infection symptoms including fever, hypoxia and dry cough, shortness of breath, and adverse effects of treatment like corticosteroids induced insomnia might lead to anxiety worsening and mental distress . Rio and Malani 3 highlighted that fatigue is commonly seen in COVID-19 epidemic, and also, the patients still have high levels of fatigue and anhedonia after recovery from infection. Treadway and Zald 4 defined anhedonia as persistently and severely decreased interest or pleasure in most daily activities. It is also known as a decrement of pleasurable activities, or a loss of interest to action in order to get pleasure. Brodaty et al 5 found that anhedonia and fatigue can also occur in patients without psychiatric disorders like in systemic illnesses ,viral infections, or chronic fatigue syndrome. Similarly, apathy and anhedonia were recognized to occur not only in the context of clinical diagnoses but also, in milder forms, in the general population, particularly with aging. Brooks et al 6 noted the effect of quarantine on cases of COVID-19 infection leading to development of psychological and cognitive manifestations of post-COVID-19 depressive symptoms, stress, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and anhedonic state. Hives et al 7 evidenced pro-inflammatory components like cytokines such as interferon gamma, and interleukin 7, which supposed to compromise the neurological regulation of the \"Glymphatic System\" as observed in chronic fatigue syndrome. Perrin et al 8 found that many cases of COVID-19 developed a drastic post-viral syndrome named \"post-COVID-19 Syndrome\"-a persistent condition of chronic fatigue, disturbed sleep/wake cycle, neuro-cognitive implications, and progressive anhedonia.",

The current study found high score of fatigue in post-COVID-19 patients, this is in agreement with Huang, et al 12 who noted that most patients in post-COVID-19 period developed muscle ache, arthralgia, weakness, fatigue, or myalgia. Also, this study concluded high scores of different domains of anhedonia which is unique and novel, this is in accordance with Pr\u00e9au et al 13 study mentioned that anhedonia was very common in viral epidemic like HIV-infected patients with highly active antiretroviral therapies.",

Also, the study evaluated the onset of anhedonia and fatigue after 2 negative PCR tests of coronavirus leading to a finding of high scores of fatigue and anhedonia during the early days after recovery, this is in parallel with Goyal et al 15 mentioned during the period next 2 weeks after cure from COVID-19, patients gradually developed sad mood, anhedonia, lethargy, anorexia, insomnia, and easy fatiguability.",

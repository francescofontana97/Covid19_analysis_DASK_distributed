Those features that are ranked more important than their shadow counterpart are marked as important. The Boruta algorithm is used as a validation method for feature importances calculated by the Random Forest algorithm. Blue boxplots are minimal, average, and maximum Z-scores of shadow features; red, yellow, and green boxplots are features that were rejected, remain tentatively important, and are confirmed important, respectively. Box upper and lower horizontal edges are first and third quartiles, whiskers denote the 1.5 interquartile range of feature importance, and circles are outliers. AUC, area under the curve; CRP, C-reactive protein; MCH, mean corpuscular hemoglobin; MCHC, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration; MCV, mean corpuscular volume; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; Hb, hemoglobin; RDW-CV, red blood cell distribution width; ROC, receiver operating characteristic; SD, standard deviation.",

Urogenital tuberculosis (UGTB) is a form of EPTB related to infectious inflammation of urogenital system organs in any combination, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium bovis.

Several studies showed that treatment models with hospitalization for the full length of the intensive phase and models with ambulatory treatment since the day of diagnosis have similar treatment success [12] [13] [14] . WHO suggests hospital admissions only for complicated patients with TB, such as with respiratory failure or requiring surgery, patients with severe forms of the disease, and life-threatening or serious adverse drug events [15] . Hospitalization is also considered when effective and safe treatment cannot be ensured in an outpatient setting [15] .",

Culture, histopathology, intravenous pyelography, laparoscopy, cystoscopy, and biopsy are the methods employed in the UGTB diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis for drug-susceptible UGTB is based on the patient's history and no history of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) among the patient's contacts. Treatment for drug-susceptible UGTB consists of intensive and continuation phases. The intensive phase consists of treatment with four drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) and lasts 56 days. Patients with UGTB are usually hospitalized for the full duration of the intensive phase. As per the national guidelines, intensive-phase treatment can be extended up to 84 days among patients with a positive culture and those with urinary biomarkers of inflammation or treatment complications. The continuation phase consists of two drugs (rifampicin and isoniazid) and is provided for six months in an outpatient setting at RSSRMCPP, regional TB centers, or primary care facilities. The continuation phase is extended up to seven months for patients with disseminated TB, TB/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and when urinary tract destruction without bacterial excretion persists for over six months. The continuation phase of treatment can last for 8-12 months, if there is coexisting tuberculous meningitis. Patients with UGTB are hospitalized during the continuation phase in cases of serious adverse effects or need for surgery. Definitions of UGTB treatment outcomes in Uzbekistan are presented in Appendix A. Decisions regarding the length of treatment and duration of hospitalization for each patient with UGTB is made by the \"consilium\", a committee of physicians authorized to make treatment decisions.",

While the initial aim was to include all patients who met inclusion criteria in the study, it was not possible to collect data on 302 of 444 (68%) of patients with UGTB. The data collection period overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic and TB centers were involved in the pandemic response, which made data collection challenging. Hence, the study was subject to a non-response bias. Our study population included patients with UGTB diagnosed at a tertiary care hospital and may not be representative of all patients with UGTB in the country. Variables, such as alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking at admission were not assessed by standardized screening tools and so were likely underestimated. Patient records had limited information on social determinants of health. Health records included information on living conditions but data on socio-economic status, homelessness, and substance abuse were not available. These variables are important predictors of hospital admissions and length of stay as per the published literature [40] . Previous research has shown that hospital-acquired infections, particularly infections caused by drug-resistant microorganisms, are common in patients with TB, which prolong the length of stay [41, 42] . Study participants were not routinely screened for hospital-acquired infections and neither were these infections monitored at RSSPMCTP. Therefore, we were not able to assess the impact of hospital-acquired infections on the length of stay. One limitation was the small sample size that restricted the analysis of factors associated with the length of stay. The finding on the link between hepatitis B and longer length of stay did not have adequate statistical power given only four patients in the sample had hepatitis B.",

            "text": "Despite these limitations, there are two important programmatic implications. First, the National TB program needs a better understanding of what proportion of hospitalizations and what length of stay in patients with TB are justified by clinical needs. One study in the United States showed that up to 40% of hospitalizations in patients with TB were avoidable [19] . This study considered both clinical and social criteria for hospitalization: clinically unstable on admission; admitted to the intensive care unit or intubated; receiving home or nursing home care; homeless or living in a congregate setting; recent alcohol/drug abuser; aged < 5 years; admitting diagnosis of a severe form of TB; and presence of mental illness [19] . A study in the Russian Federation found that about 20% of hospital admissions in patients with TB would not be justified when clinical (severity of disease), public health (risk of transmission), social (risk behaviors and socio-economic status), and health-system factors (access to outpatient care) are considered as hospitalization criteria [35] . Similar research, particularly in patients with UGTB, will help the National Tuberculosis Programme in Uzbekistan to infer hospitalization data more appropriately. Second, high admission rates at the tertiary care found in the study and multiple comorbidities among patients with UGTB may indicate a delay in diagnosis that contributes to a severe illness and prolonged hospitalization [25] . In this regard, there is a need to understand what contributes most to the delay (late presentation by the patients to the health system, low clinical suspicion of UGTB on the part of health care providers at primary care, non-productive referrals within the health system) and address these barriers.",

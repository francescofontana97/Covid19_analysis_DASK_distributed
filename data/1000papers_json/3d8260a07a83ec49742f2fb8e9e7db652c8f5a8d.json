Third, nafamostat mesylate, an anticoagulant, has been widely used for extracorporeal circulation and in patients with DIC in Japan. Furthermore, thromboembolic events among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have seen an increase, and anticoagulants could improve in-hospital mortality and survival [4] .

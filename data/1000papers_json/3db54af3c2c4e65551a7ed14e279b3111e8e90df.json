Design aesthetics of an m-commerce site was shown to positively influence the perceived enjoyment by the user, and it was shown that perceived enjoyment is as important to the loyalty of a user as perceived usefulness [22] . Based on these studies it can be said that practitioners can use different general aesthetic characteristics or interventions, such as symmetry, clarity and cleanliness, and expressive aesthetic qualities (creativity, special effects and originality) to evoke a positive affective state in users [24] .

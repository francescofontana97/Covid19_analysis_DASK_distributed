It marks the 2021 recurrence of RARE DISEASE DAY, which takes place every year on the last day of February 28th. The primary goal of this world-wide initiative is to heighten awareness in our societies of the existence of rare diseases and the impact they have on the individuals living with them and their families. Heightened awareness and understanding not only among the general public but also among policy makers, public health authorities, industry representatives, researchers, and health professionals.",

And nowhere, perhaps, is this threat more frightening than among the world's 300 million vulnerable individuals with diseases so rare that even obtaining a diagnosis can represent a struggle, let alone treatment and ongoing care.",

Clearly, much has been done, but unresolved problems remain, including inequalities, the heterogeneity of approaches, and lack of targeted therapies. Today's challenges involve increasing the exchange of data and knowledge through international repositories, promoting collaboration, orienting our research to obtain a better understanding of the causes of rare diseases, and designing novel and effective therapeutics [2] . Exploiting the wealth of innovative information technology available today, we can and must carry out patient-centered research that addresses the full impact (physical, psychological, and social) of these rare conditions-on the patients who live with them, their families, and ultimately our societies as a whole.",

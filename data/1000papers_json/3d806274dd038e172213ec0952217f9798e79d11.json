Until recently few species of the total present in any marine situation have had diagnostic value. More-over, as Day, Field, and Montgomery ( 1971) have noted, they have been at the two extremes of abundance-the dominant species (as mentioned above) and the rare and occasional species which have been used as planktonic indicators if not of associations then at least of water masses. Whittaker (1962) , Mcintosh ( 1967) , Mills ( 1969) , and Stephenson, Williams, and Lance (1970) have pointed out that in plant ecology there have been, in rough chronological order, (a) the dominance school, (b) the Braun-Blanquet school of floristic associations characterized by the fidelity and constancy of certain species, (c) the school of individualistic dissenters who deny the existence of associations, and finally (d) the school of numerical analysts who have established associations with different degrees of coherence by mathematical methods. Use of computers has increased the speed and power of these methods. Few such studies have been made on the benthos of shallow waters. G. F. Jones (1969) used computer methods on samples from Southern California and stated (p. 193) : \"The accurate distribution of organisms lies somewhere between the idea of 'biocoenosis' and the idea of continuum without discontinuities.\" The difference between this concept and those of other workers in the same area (Hartman and Barnard 1958 , 1960 , Barnard and Ziesenhenne 1961 may well be due to the difference in analytical methods.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 10, "end": 48, "text": "(Stephenson, Williams, and Lance 1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 304, "end": 338, "text": "Day, Field, and Montgomery ( 1971)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 577, "end": 593, "text": "Whittaker (1962)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 596, "end": 612, "text": "Mcintosh ( 1967)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 615, "end": 628, "text": "Mills ( 1969)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 635, "end": 673, "text": "Stephenson, Williams, and Lance (1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1288, "text": "Jones (1969)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1366, "text": "California and stated (p. 193)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1590, "end": 1615, "text": "(Hartman and Barnard 1958", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1616, "end": 1622, "text": ", 1960", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1653, "text": ", Barnard and Ziesenhenne 1961", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "We have used computer techniques in the analysis of dredged catches from Moreton Bay, Queensland.

Jones (1969) we presented two clear alternatives: either independent distributions of individual species (implying continuity and no associations), or a complex situation of ill-defined species groups and site groups. In defending the use of objective methods of analysis we stated (p. 486) that \"Even in higher latitudes and simpler situations, objective methods of analysis merit trial. \" We have also used such methods in analyzing a limited number of grab catches from Sek Harbour, New Guinea, where, because of the ~armer conditions, a more complex situation than that existing in Moreton Bay might have been anticipated-in other words, even further deviation from the classical Petersen-type community.

One approach to this problem is to use objective classificatory programs for re-examining the original data.

However, Petersen sometimes based his communities on genera rather than species, for example, with Echinocardium and with Nucula, so the incomplete identifications would not affect his analysis. Petersen (1914: 4-5) selected the species which diagnosed his communities in the following terms: \"The animals, which are not seasonal and which compose an important part of the whole mass of the community, owing to number or weight will presumably be best suited for characterizing the community . . . . \" Later (p. 7) he repeats: \"It is thus seen, that we are able on broad lines to give a vertical characterization of the main quantity of the animals, at least at the places chosen, by means of a few, either very cominon or' very heavy species.\" Earlier (p. 4) he justified the exclusion of many species for characterizing purposes in these words: \". . . the long lists just obscure the differences especially if not accompanied hy [sic] quantitative information, which can emphasize the characteristic species by comparison with the less important.\" In summary.

Petersen designated his communities by species which were dominant by numbers and weights. The disparities between our classifications imply that a compromise involving numbers and weights is not possible, but instead a decision must be made between communities based upon numbers and communities based on weights. Field and McFarlane (1968) have also compared numbers and weights classifications with computer methods. They obtain the same main groupings with the two methods, but obtained \"differences in fine structure of the groupings\" (p. 13 2) . Comparison of the dendrograms (their Fig.  5 and 7) shows that the differences in \"fine structure\" are appreciable. They also compared the results of presence-absence analyses and analyses using numbers and weights. Their conclusions, with which we agree, are that analyses using quantities are necessary, and that it is far from obvious whether the extra labor in obtaining weight data for analysis is worthwhile. Inherent in many concepts of the community is the idea that a group of species will have similar ecological requirements and hence act as a unit in pattern of site distribution. No such groups were revealed in Petersen's original work. He sometimes listed a single species as characterizing a group of sites, sometimes it combined with one or more others, and elsewhere with yet others.

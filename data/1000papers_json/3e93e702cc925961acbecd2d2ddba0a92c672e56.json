Scholars argue that the largely traded volumes of these precious assets have greatly increased their liquidity, which has helped promote their tradability (Frankel, 1986; Lutzenberger et al., 2017; Shammugam et al., 2019) . Consequently, these assets can be treated at par with other traditional financial assets like stocks and bonds. However, others hold gold and silver as passive investments. Since these assets are unproductive, any growth in their values is entirely dependent on the belief that eventually other investors will be willing to pay more for having these precious metals. Despite the polarized opinions on the investment in gold and silver, pair trading remains a popular trading strategy. This is a market neutral strategy which empowers traders to make profit from essentially any market conditions: sideways, upturns and downturns. Herein, different positions on these two metals are taken simultaneously by hedge fund traders to hedge risk (Huang and Martin, 2017) . In order to maximize profits, the traders adopt effective strategies using all the concomitant information about the price behaviour of these metals and all other information related to the macro-economy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 280, "end": 295, "text": "(Frankel, 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 296, "end": 322, "text": "Lutzenberger et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 323, "end": 346, "text": "Shammugam et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1112, "text": "(Huang and Martin, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The volatility of all metal prices in general has been a constant source of motivation in examining the behaviour of these prices, particularly during tumultuous times.

Nevertheless, the portfolio diversification strategy is effective, if the related metals do not react in consonance with financial markets' information (CPA Australia, 2012) . Similarly, the high volatile prices of the precious metals namely gold and silver would enhance diversification opportunities, which will enable investors to have optimal hedged portfolios.

One strand of the literature argues that both metals are different from one another and are distinctive based on their commercial uses. Therefore, the markets pertaining to these two precious metals should be separated as gold and silver are not close substitutes. Another strand of literature explains that gold and silver, most often act as close substitutes, since they are considered as alternatives and secure investments during financial turmoil and help in mitigating inflationary risks. The prices of the gold and silver are expected to follow unit root process as it is determined in speculative markets. Any evidence of cointegration between these markets, provide insights about the efficient markets. 1 The inclusion of several macroeconomic factors which reflects public information in the current study is a value addition in understanding the various forms of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. 2 The literature on the gold and silver markets emphasizes three aspects: (i) the responses of those precious metals prices under different economic conditions (Frankel and Hardouvelis, 1985; Cornell and French, 1986; Christie-David et al., 2000; Lucey and O'Connor, 2016) ; (ii) the predictability of the gold and silver prices (Miffre and Rallis, 2007; Auer, 2016) ; and (iii) the causal relationship between the gold and silver prices (Wahab et al., 1994; Hillier et al., 2006; Pierdzioch et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2016; Schweikert, 2018) . There are a few other researchers that focus on the importance of precious metals such as examining the determinants of price of gold (Levin and Wright, 2006) ; gold as a safe haven for investments (Hood and Malik, 2013; Shahbaz et al., 2014; Walczak-Ga\ufffd nko, 2016) ; investment in gold as a hedge against inflation (Ranson, 2005; Shahbaz et al., 2014) and investment of gold as a hedge against variations in exchange rates (Capie et al., 2004) . Therefore, most of the literature focus on gold markets only and ignore other precious metals. In India the platinum and palladium markets are not important. Several past studies had provided evidence of the association between gold and silver prices (e.g., Liu and Su, 2019 for China; Kirithiga and Naresh, 2016 for India; Mishra et al., 2019 for India) in the emerging market economies.

Further, using monthly data during the period 1971 to 1990, Escribano and Granger (1998) investigate the long-run relationship between gold and silver prices and find cointegration between those two precious metal markets during the bubble and post-bubble periods. Similarly, Ciner (2001) probes the long-run relationship between gold and silver prices of the futures contracts traded on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange and shows a disappearance of the stable long run relationship between those prices during the 1990s (the disappearance is primarily due to the separation of markets). The daily closing data on gold and silver prices commences from 1992 through 1998. Lucey and Tully (2006) examine the dynamic relationship between gold and silver prices using Fridays' closing prices over the period 1978 through 2002.

First, India hosts the oldest and most extensive physical gold market in the world and Indian gold consumption is often estimated at 1000 tonnes per year. India is also one of the largest silver markets in the world. Most of the gold and silver supplies are imported. Second, India is a country with rich cultural heritage and customs. The precious metals such as gold and silver are highly demanded and hold cultural and traditional significance in India. In particular, the gold and silver ornaments and jewelleries are preferred over other metals during Indian weddings and are considered to be auspicious for new beginnings. The Indian Hindu calendar also mentions the importance of buying these precious metals on auspicious days namely Akshaya Tritiya, Dhanteras, Durga Puja, 1 Certain attributes namely, prices of assets being sensitive to any new information and the random movement of the asset prices are considered as the basis of the Efficient Market hypothesis (EMH) assessments. If the price adjusts more or less than the normal and the asset prices are non-random, then this leads to a violation of EMH.

Silver, on the other hand, is least costly and hence preferred over other precious metals by the people for gifting purposes. Moreover, silver jewelleries have become more popular among youngsters because the jewelleries and ornaments made out of it is much more apt and elegant as compared to gold and platinum. Third, the demand for gold and silver in India is underpinned by the unusually strong demand for jewellery and fast growth in the Indian economy. Fourth, gold and silver prices are affected by the government's trade policies which affect supply by regulating the material flows. Fifth, prices of these metals are also affected by the volatile behaviour of the Indian rupee.

The literature on platinum and palladium in India is not significant because those precious metals do not play a major role in the Indian context, which justifies conducting this current study on gold and silver markets for India. (iii) Our contribution to the literature regarding the gold and silver metal markets is particularly in terms of the innovative methodology applied to a very populous country where those precious metals figure highly. Previous studies employ the Johansen cointegration, VECM and linear Granger causality to probe the relationship between Indian futures and spot markets of Gold and Silver (Kirithiga and Naresh, 2016) ; the rolling-window bootstrap approach to investigate the time-varying causalities between gold and silver prices (Liu and Su, 2019) ; rolling window bootstrap approach, the wavelet based time-varying Granger-causality test and the non-linear Granger-causality test to provide different insights to the gold and silver returns relationship (Mishra et al., 2019) . In particular, the current study employs the frequency domain rolling-window analysis to unfold the causal link between these precious metals. Gold & Silver prices are linked with financial and macro-economic variables as established by Pierdzioch et al. (2014a,b) . Qian et al. (2019) considered the dollar index, the federal funds rate, CPI, exchange rate, oil price and S&P500 in explaining the gold price as drivers of the link. Christie-David et al. (2000) recognize that macroeconomic factors as reflected by financial news that affect metal prices. Therefore, we include some macroeconomic variables, namely the stock market index (BSE), interest rate and rate of inflation, which are used as control variables to examine the causality between gold and silver returns in a conditional economic and financial framework. These variables would reflect the various macro-economic policies undertaken by the government that comes in the form of financial news. This kind of set-up has not been explored in the past literature, and therefore makes this study unique in experiment with regard to the Indian gold and silver markets.

To meet the unsustainable deficit of the BOP, the Reserve Bank of India, in consultation with the government of India, decided to confiscate the gold reserves held by them in order to raise the foreign exchange resources. The government also stopped the import of gold with an immediate effect from October 1, 1990 and allowed the State bank of India to the use of gold lying in the government mint to meet the requirements of the jewellery exporters when gold saved the day for India (i.e., September 4, 2013) (Business Standard, 2013). It is for the first time the gold reserves of the country were depleted drastically. The rationale of the choice of this sample period is due to these notable historic events. (v) Additionally, the time period considered for the present analysis includes several episodes of crises that occurred in the past namely the East Asian crisis of 1997-1998, the Dot com bubble burst of 2000, the Global financial crisis of 2007-2009 and the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010-2012. We expect that the consequences of the crises would have a considerable impact on the prices and returns of these precious metals, given the macroeconomic factors. The past literature did not consider a dataset of this length. For instance, Ciner (2001) uses the daily closing prices of gold and silver future contracts covering a period from 1992 through 1998 and explores the long-run relationship. Lucey and Tully (2006) consider the Friday closing prices covering a period from 1978 to 2002 and find a weak relationship between gold and silver prices in a few sub-periods and a long-run stable cointegration relationship between these precious metals. Using 15-intraday data ranging from 27 December 1993 through 30 December 1995, Adrangi et al. (2000) probe the price discovery process in the gold and silver price futures contracts. Batten et al. (2013) consider the daily prices of gold and silver from a period 1999 through 2005 to test the bivariate relationship between gold and silver prices. By departing from those earlier studies, an extensive time series data of more than 27 years should be able to provide insights into the various nuances of the markets of these precious metals. (iv) Finally, the outcome of this study is expected to provide policy inputs to various market participants regarding the bonding relation between those two precious metals in India, using the employed novel and other techniques. Most importantly, a country-level study of this kind is crucial given the uniqueness and heterogeneity of the Indian commodity markets, compared to other emerging market peers.

The difference GC is better than the conditional GC in controlling the loss of information that may arise from the low-pass filtering introduced by the hemodynamic response function. The Toda Yamamoto test is a modified version of the Granger causality test which takes one extra lag and can be used for causality testing of the variables, irrespective of the stationary properties. In our case we had applied the Toda and Yamamoto approach to log level series while for other causality tests stationary series were used for analysis.

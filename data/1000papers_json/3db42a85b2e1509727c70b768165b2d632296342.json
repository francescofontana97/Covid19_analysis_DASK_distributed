While there is increasing diversity of the population, there remain significant disparities in morbidity and mortality affecting minority groups, and persistent low numbers of underrepresented students in the health professions. Increasing the numbers of underrepresented minority students in health care and decreasing the disparity gap have been a priority for many institutions. Increasing diversity requires an approach that not only involves health professions schools but also involves undergraduate institutions, faculty, and other professionals who provide pre-health training to students. In 2018, a group of academic medicine leaders convened the Innovators, Collaborators, and Leaders conference with faculty at institutions across the state of North Carolina to discuss ways to improve learner preparedness for health professions education and increase numbers of underrepresented students pursuing health careers. In this manuscript, the authors share results from the conference and how institutional and faculty partnerships can promote learner preparedness for health professions education.",

While US demographic statistics show increasing diversity of the population, there remain significant disparities in morbidity and mortality affecting minority groups, including African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders (https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/ educational/healthdisp/about-health-disparities.htm). Diversity in the US health care workforce is also limited and lags behind diversity in the population [1, 2] . Increasing the numbers of underrepresented minorities (URM) in health care may increase health access and care opportunities for underserved groups, as URM physicians are more likely to care for the medically underserved [3] . URMs in the health professions can include Black or African-American, Latinx, and Native American people. Creating partnerships among Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Native American Serving Institutions (NASIs), and predominantly white institutions (PWIs) can benefit all institutions, as PWIs can benefit from HBCU and NASI diversity and resilience, while HBCUs and NASIs can benefit from PWI resources and infrastructure [4] [5] [6] . Even though relationships among PWIs, HBCUs, and NASIs can be strained around issues of social justice, inequities in resource provision, and perceived little desire for such partnerships among PWIs [7] , fostering these relationships is a challenge worth undertaking.",

            "text": "Despite the success of pipeline programs, concerns have been raised that the STEM pipeline is leaking: i.e., learners are not progressing through STEM training to enter health careers, and existing programs do not accommodate enough learners to meet the demand [12, 13] . Specific challenges facing these programs include underprepared students, time constraints, instructional challenges, loss of autonomy, and resistance to change, to name a few. These barriers contribute to unsuccessful instructional practices and further contribute to STEM pipeline leakage [14] . Overcoming contributors to the STEM pipeline leak in North Carolina would require developing processes to control the geographic disadvantage, whereby resources are unequally distributed across the state. This disadvantage is especially compounded in the eastern part of the state, due to low socioeconomic status of residents, health inequities, rurality, and poorer health status [15, 16] . Resources provided for student success need to be accessible and affordable, as well as reflecting the fact that different challenges exist for traditional and non-traditional students [13] . Variability in students' preparation and prior experience, as well as variability in learning environments, can contribute to students dropping out of STEM disciplines. Learners need consistent, progressive, and systematic mentoring throughout their academic careers, as well as culturally welcoming and inclusive learning environments that provide the resources and staffing needed for academic success [13, 17, 18] . Since many pipeline programs may be hosted by one institution but ultimately prepare learners to continue their education at other institutions, academic institutions have to work collaboratively and be held mutually accountable for learner success and resource support [19] . This accountability should involve creating strategic partnerships, increasing awareness of pipeline leakage, and tracking progress of diversity in STEM programs at the institutional level [13] .",

Collaboration with the community is important to promote learner success and program completion, as there is much medical school that can learn from community partnerships [20] . As many pipeline programs attract learners from local middle and high schools, in addition to college undergraduates [21] , working with school administrators, teachers, and other staff can strengthen the relationships between health professions' schools and the communities which they serve. A holistic approach to learning that takes into account learners' distance traveled (i.e., obstacles that learners had to overcome to reach their present position) in addition to academic performance can identify learner strengths for navigating the pipeline. Programs should also recognize that students from underrepresented groups may experience anxiety and other emotional concerns that can negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being [22] , and build in processes to address these concerns. Furthermore, institutions should recognize that women in STEM may have unique needs that are not readily addressed by STEM pipeline programs, and create the supportive environment that is needed for their success [23] .",

Tracking institutional progress can help individual institutions assume responsibility for improving practices and can provide useful information to potential program funders. Increased access to program information, creating strategic partnerships, and programming with data-driven interventions can increase positive outcomes for URM students [13] . Using innovative STEM technologies, monetizing teachers' ideas, providing summer opportunities to students, and research project materials to schools may also help with the leaky pipeline. Collaborative efforts to create STEM days at universities and a certified STEM school status may also advance progress towards this goal. For the struggling learner, using integrated multidisciplinary pedagogy in pre-med and pre-health courses may assist in identifying learner needs and mobilizing targeted resources. Providing opportunities for PWI, NASI and HBCU faculty to become better acquainted with resource availability and opportunities can foster the growth of partnerships among these institutions. Moreover, including HBCUs and NASIs in inter-institutional collaborations with research clusters and health care system partners at PWIs may increase chances for STEM involvement among URM learners [19] .",

Faculty who mentor students have a better relationship with their students, may have more diverse ideas for research projects, and may be viewed more favorably for promotion and tenure [40] . Faculty should be provided with basic mentoring tools such as literature on mentoring, resources on how to mentor, protected time for mentorship, and funding support to mentor students and peers successfully. Faculty should have opportunities to learn how to approach the challenges of mentoring relations, how to utilize the products of mentoring for scholarship and research, and how to overcome common barriers that interfere with an effective mentoring relationship, including factors related to the duration of the mentoring relationship, the number of students served, the structure of the mentoring program, student demographics, and faculty interest [40] . Mentorship models that foster success for both mentors and mentees should be explored with all faculty members, with a focus on project development, research methods, and establishment of infrastructure support that is equitable and effective [37] . Mentorship training should include how to mentor learners across different cultures and backgrounds [18] . Specific mentorship for underrepresented faculty should be considered to address the minority tax, microaggressions, bias, and how to best approach race discordant mentorship relationships [24, 41] .",

A subsequent meeting of the steering committee was held in 2019 to discuss conference outcomes in the light of conference objectives, develop a plan for writing this manuscript, and share results with stakeholders and partners. Subsequent planning continues but has been slowed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

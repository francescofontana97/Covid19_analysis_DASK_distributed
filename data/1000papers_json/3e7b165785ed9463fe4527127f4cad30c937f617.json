It might be advantageous to take a different perspective to focus by targeting the cell death pathways involved in the development of multi-organ dysfunction during the infection. Strategies that inhibit upstream cell death pathways may prevent downstream immune activation implicated in COVID-19 associated multi-organ dysfunction. In addition, direct inhibition of alveolar cell death may preserve lung architecture and prevent some of the long-term sequelae such as the breathelessness experienced by patients who have recovered from COVID-19.",

Mice treated with dexmedetomidine exhibited J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reduced inflammation-induced cell death (pyroptosis) in astrocytes and in turn protected neurones in sepsis-induced brain injury 7 . The underlying protective mechanisms of dexmedetomidine include increasing parasympathetic tone, dampening inflammatory response, preventing cell death and inhibiting oxidative stress9 . By increasing parasympathetic tone and decreasing sympathetic tone, dexmedetomidine appears to confer protective effects on immune function by effects on T cells and natural killer cells. Furthermore, its cholinergic anti-inflammatory mechanisms might suppress excessive inflammatory responses9 . A trial in the critical care setting has shown that dexmedetomidine was effective in attenuating the incidence of delirium in elderly patients6, 6b  .Based on these properties, we propose that dexmedetomidine may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to attenuate the vital organ injuries of COVID-19 (Figure 1) whilst simultaneously providing beneficial sedative effects for oxygen therapies delivered via either noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. ICU sedation with dexmedetomidine is associated with impaired ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia to a similar extent as that associated with propofol sedation. This may indicate that ventilatory suppression by dexmedetomidine is likely caused by effects on both peripheral and central regulation of breathing 10 . This inhibition of respiratory drive could be beneficial for patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation in which hypoxaemia-associated hyperventilation and respiratory distress are significant problems. Dexmedetomidine should be used as soon as is possible after sedation is required in COVID-19 patients to help prevent the onset or progression of multi-organ dysfunction. During the early disease course, when patients need deep sedation, it may be used as a sedative adjunct together with other sedatives, e.g. propofol or midazolam. Its use as a single agent at high doses for sedation may also be considered if such treatment shows efficacy against multi-organ dysfunction, although the risk of bradycardia and hypotension should be considered. In summary, there is a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f strong rationale for further clinical studies investigating the effects of dexmedetomidine on outcomes in ICU patients with COVID-19.

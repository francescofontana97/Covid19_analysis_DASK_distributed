Major cultural and supporting events have been suspended. National-level responses to the disease are also unprecedented. On the one hand, governments are taking emergency measures, such as shutdowns for social distancing and investments in testing and quarantining the suspected cases and treating the confirmed cases, to contain the disease.

Since the disease has brought extreme uncertainty with respect to how deadly disease really is, whether and when can we get a vaccine, what effects government policies will have, how people will respond, and so on (Wagner 2020) , the reaction of stock market investors is also mixed with unprecedented volatility (Baker et al. 2020) . Stock markets are moving up and down with the news of COVID-19 and related control measures or stimulus packages such as direct fiscal support or decrease in interest rates, among others. For instance, US stock market observed three of the 15 worst days ever during March 9 to 16, while one of the top 10 surges ever in the market also took place in this time period (Wagner 2020) . Other international factors are also causing systematic risk and moving stock markets simultaneously with COVID-19. One such important factor which is having confounding impact on stock market volatility together with COVID-19 is the tussle between Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil supply and prices. On 6 th March, Russia refused to comply with the oil supply cut decision made by OPEC summit in Vienna on March 5, 2020. In response, Saudi Arabia made announcements on 8 th March regarding price discounts ranging from $6 to $8 per barrel for European and Asian customers and oil production increases.

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China. It causes an infection named coronavirus disease 2019 , and is now spreading worldwide. Currently, there are no approved treatment options in Europe and there is no available vaccine. Reports from China, Europe, and USA suggest a high mortality rate and stretched intensive care unit (ICU) capacity [1] [2] [3] . It has been found that the main risk factors for death are obesity, hypertension, diabetes, male gender, and older age. Moreover, Liang et al. reported that 1% of COVID-19 patients had a history of cancer, higher than that of the overall Chinese population (0.29%), with lung cancer being the most frequently found. Moreover, patients with cancer seemed to have a higher risk of severe events (ICU admission, need of assisted ventilation, death), reaching 39% versus 8% in those not suffering from a neoplasia [4] . Their study suggests that hospital admission and recurrent outpatient visits, inherent to cancer patients' management, are potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Another aspect which may probably be even more relevant in cancer patients is their inability to receive the necessary care in time, under the changed scenario of a viral pandemic management.",

Indeed, prospective studies showed that consolidation, in association with anthracycline, with either intermediate or high dose of cytarabine, did not result in significant differences in the 5-year overall survival, whereas prolongation of neutropenia and higher transfusion demands were observed in the high dose cytarabine arm [13] [14] [15] .

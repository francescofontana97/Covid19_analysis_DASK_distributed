Based on a study in a simulated environment, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests limiting the number of reuses to five per N95 to ensure an adequate safety margin 3 ; however, such approach likely leads to discard of clinically effective N95s earlier than necessary 4 . Our primary objective was to evaluate effectiveness of reused N95s in a real-world healthcare setting during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Any N95 that failed the seal check or the saccharine fit-test was further evaluated with a confirmatory quantitative fit-test using the ambient aerosol condensation nuclei counter (PortaCount\u00ae) protocol 6,7 . A fit factor result on this protocol of < 100 is considered a failure. Due to constraints on N95 supply we used the quantitative method to evaluate only those N95s that failed a screening test as the PortaCount test requires insertion of a probe through the N95 to count particles rendering the N95 unusable. At the time of the study, the only available N95 models at our institution were 3M 1860 (dome-shape) and 3M 1870 (duck-bill). HCWs who failed the fittest were given a new N95.

We did not perform a PortaCount on N95s that passed the seal check or the saccharine fit-test due to limited N95 supplies and we may have overestimated \"passes\"; however, false passes are infrequent with the saccharin method 8 . Although we evaluated two of the most commonly used N95 respirators in the United States 9 , findings may not be generalizable to alternative models. The number of repeated N95 donnings was based on HCW recall, which may have been under-or over-estimated; however, we do not think there was bias in either direction. We did not sample the N95s to assess for pathogen contamination, a risk of N95 reuse, but our protocol of face shield to protect N95 reduces this risk by preventing droplets from landing on the respirator surface. This study was not powered to assess effectiveness of N95s to prevent SARS-COV-2 infection or other potentially airborne transmitted infections. Notably, no patient-to-HCW SARS-COV-2 transmissions have been documented for HCWs who complied with the recommended COVID-19 precautions at JHH to date (authors' personal communication).

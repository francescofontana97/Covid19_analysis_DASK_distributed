While online shopping benefits generally exceed disadvantages, lack of personal touch, especially when a customer is overwhelmed by many alternative products is perceived as a major obstacle to shopping online. To alleviate this problem, online stores invest in personalization tools, recommendation systems being a very popular example of them. Recommendation adequacy plays a vital role in overall commercial success and customer satisfaction. However, due to the significant loads of marketing content and increasing browsing speeds, users may often not notice the displayed recommendations. Therefore, the way of presenting a recommendation, and its positioning and usability seem to have an important role in the ultimate recommendation effectiveness.",

There is much less research in selecting the best ways the products should be presented to the customer compared to massive research in the field of recommendation algorithms [11, 12] . The most appropriate ways of presenting a recommendation item to users can be learned by observing human-computer interaction, with websites and recommending interfaces in particular. While interacting with websites, human behavior can be observed via eye tracking [13] or by collecting events inside modern web browsers [2] , based respectively on gaze sensors and mouse/keystroke sensors. The investigation of visual aspects of recommending interfaces could better integrate those interfaces in online stores [10, 14] . The position and layout of a recommendation zone, the number of recommendations, the size of associated images, product titles and prices, etc. can all be evaluated toward interface improvement [15] . In the era of information overload, in particular enormous marketing content, the habituation effect often comes into action, resulting in the banner blindness phenomenon [16] . Even the best recommendations from the algorithm perspective may have little effect unless they are properly presented [16] [17] [18] -with the right layout and position on a website, at the right moment of the browsing and purchase process, with the right visual intensity (understood as the level of content intrusiveness) [19] and in the right context, etc. [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

The general aim of the study was to evaluate two layouts and three visual intensity levels of item presentation and varied positions of recommendations in a basic-structure recommending interface, while the levels of attention drawn and inspired product interest were monitored. This paper focuses on the analysis of the effectiveness of recommendation interfaces based on the eye-tracking research in relation to purchasing based on recommendations using a number of machine learning methods. The eye-tracking study results were compared with the results of an implicit feedback study performed via browser add-ons on a group of participants for major e-commerce websites in Poland. The results were analyzed and models for predicting recommendation effectiveness were built using different machine learning methods to find the best-performing ones. This paper's original contribution also relates to using two different methods of tracking user behaviors and thus user interest-eye tracking and collecting implicit feedback via a web browser add-on-to compare their applicability for building automated mechanisms of recommending interface personalization.",

Therefore, inobtrusive implicit measures are better suited for the purpose of the study, allowing the monitored subjects to focus only on tasks performed, not causing additional cognitive load, and not requiring unique motivation to provide explicit ratings [28, 29] .",

Eye-tracking technology was used for implicit user visual behavior observation and analysis. Eye tracking is the most popular technique of observing human visual activity and providing a large amount of implicit feedback and can be performed with standalone or wearable devices. Within the scope of the study, gaze-based data were used and interpreted in a simple e-commerce scenario. Eye movements were used to discover which areas of a shopping website are mostly looked at, attracting user attention as being the most relevant to the user. Raw data were processed and analyzed with the help of popular eye-tracking software and data analytics algorithms to generate metrics regarding eye fixation and gaze. Although eye movements are often unconscious and chaotic in nature, they are generally tightly connected with cognitive processes [30] . Thus, based on gaze data from eye tracking, it is possible to conclude about user attention and interest. Gaze is an invaluable source of data for providing information on how much attention a user pays to contents on the screen [31] . For the following analyses, total fixation duration is the main gaze-based measure used. This parameter is used as an indicator of attractiveness by a lot of other studies [32] [33] [34] . It is calculated as the sum of durations of fixations aggregated on a website section, an area of interest (AOI), one with recommendation content (RC), i.e., presentation of the recommended items, and the main section with editorial content (EC), i.e., the main viewed product description, pictures, etc.",

This monitoring tool was implemented as an extension for the Mozilla Firefox browser, with the core monitoring code being easily detachable and available for external use. ECPM allows for monitoring of human-website interaction by exploiting document object model (DOM) events. HTML document object model events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document. Our ECPM unobtrusively collects data on visited product pages and user interactions, recording numerous parameters describing the page's physical attributes and interactions. Among many collected parameters connected with the recommending interfaces were times of mouse cursor spent inside recommendation zones and their physical size measured as the number of characters within recommended products section. As other research shows, mouse position may be quite strongly correlated with eye gaze [37] [38] [39] . Tracking mouse movements can be used as a lower-quality and easier to perform alternative to eye tracking for the purpose of identification of user interest. Measured times with cursor being over recommended products were related to other measures such as total time spent on the product page and page height and length measured by a number of characters, images, etc. In this way, relative measures of cursor times spent inside particular recommendation interfaces were generated.",

The first three RCi positions were most favorable regardless of the layout type, whereas the fourth positions in the list were the least eye-catching ones. Surprisingly, the most popular of all was the RC3 location in a horizontal layout (3.9 s). This might have been affected by the fact that this recommendation item was located right above the main product list. Next in terms of popularity were sections RC2 and RC1, respectively, situated in the vertical layout. The clear popularity of RC2 in this layout was caused by the flickering (VI2) effect shown in one product category. The popularity of RC1 although always shown without any extra visual intensity effects (VI1) may be resulting from that many people tend to perceive the first/top location in a list being the best one. In the case of the vertical layout, the first location performed better than RC3 despite presenting it with very strong intensity VI3 for one product category. Both items RC3 in the vertical layout and RC2 in the horizontal layout performed equally despite that the latter was distinguished with flickering effect (VI2) for one product category. From the sales view, 12% of products were added to carts directly from the recommending interfaces, while around 13% of products were firstly seen by subjects in RC and added from the main EC. This constitutes roughly 25% of all products being added to the cart directly from RC or indirectly (influenced by RC). Around 75% of products were selected directly from the main EC without any influence from RC. Coincidentally, it is exactly the same proportion as the one of recommending interface fixation time to task completion time, which somehow shows the importance of focusing attention on recommended items. Vertical RC layout accounted for 60% of adding to cart actions, while the rest were thanks to horizontal RC layout-the vertical one turned out to be much more effective than the horizontal. This may connect with the so-called banner blindness phenomenon, where banners have often been located in the same site area as horizontal recommendations in the analyzed experiment.",

In the better performing vertical layout, the most attractive were the first and second positions in the list. A slow flickering effect used in the second position influenced its attractiveness. On the other hand, the high visual attractiveness of the first position in the list, despite the lack of any visual highlight, may have resulted from the conception that the first one is always the best (similarly to search results). The worse effect of the horizontal layout may be connected with the so-called banner blindness.

Therefore, we plan to use more advanced eye tracking for gathering more data, considering the variable nature of gaze and detecting eye fatigue issues. We also intend to include the cognitive emotion information based on the fact that different types of eye motions can represent different emotions [47, 48] and integrate a facial expression recognition (FER) module to include data on human sentiment while surfing the e-commerce sites. We will also perform both eye tracking and implicit events tracking at the same time to cross-compare their results and possibly come up with an optimized hybrid approach. Moreover, we want to develop our eventsbased solutions to recognize users' activity, including time spent displaying particular AOIs in recommending interfaces on computers and mobile devices, focusing on visual aspects such as layout and intensity, in order to seek best-performing solutions for this multidimensional problem.",

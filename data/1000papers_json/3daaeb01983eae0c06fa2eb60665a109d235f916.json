Interestingly, the negative correlation between PEC and NRFHT and COVID-19 was also noted by Zhang et al [7] . This underscores limitations inherent in the methodology of retrospective analysis likely responsible for the conflicting literature results on the overall placental pathology in SARS-CoV-2.

In our case the intervillositis was composed of mixed inflammatory infiltrate, but otherwise had features classically described in massive chronic intervillositis (MHI) or chronic histiocytic intervillosistis (CHI): namely, marked intervillous inflammation, intervillous fibrin, and trophoblast necrosis [17, 18] . Although in most of the cases this pathology has been associated with allo-or autoimmune dysregulations resulting in intrauterine growth restriction and recurrent reproductive loss [19, 20] , in a small subset of cases, MCI/CHI has infectious etiologies, such as malaria [21] and CMV [22] . While non-infectious MCI/CHI is composed of almost exclusively histiocytes and lymphocytes, intervillositis in infections, such as Chlamydia, Listeria, tularemia, and others, is characterized by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate [20] . The presence of neutrophils may provide a useful diagnostic clue, allowing to suspect infection as a cause of MCI/CHI. Intervillous fibrin and trophoblast necrosis, originally described in MCI/CHI, were prominent in our case of SARS-CoV-2 intervillositis and likely related to the direct injury of STB by SARS-CoV-2. In this respect the MCI/CHI in SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), in which the virus directly affects alveolar epithelium leading to the exposure on the injured cellular surfaces factors promoting fibrin accumulation. Similar to DAD, the histopathological features of MCI/CHI in SARS-CoV-2 infection are not indicative of the etiology and only IHC and/or ISH can provide the specific diagnosis.",

Some women may also be more susceptible to STB invasion due to individual genetic polymorphisms regulating cellular entry or cellular defenses. We, however, favor that the viral invasion in the placenta follows the pattern described in the lungs, where the virus was detectable in the alveolar epithelium only during the narrow temporal window of the acute stage of DAD and was cleared off in the organizing DAD [33] . The duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 20 days on average, ranging from 5 to 60 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f days [34] . It may therefore be possible that if the virus reaches and affects placenta prior to delivery, it can be cleared and no longer be detectable in a placental specimen obtained at childbirth. Further studies are needed to elucidate the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 feto-maternal infection.",

Both CD4-and CD8-positive T cells were seen, while Bcell and plasma cell markers CD20 and CD79A were negative. At high magnification, the STB showed signs of cellular injury, including \"dusky\" nuclei with homogenized chromatin, karyorrhexis, pycnosis, loss of nuclear basophilia, and clearing of cytoplasm with eventual formation of \"ghost\" cells (Figure 1 C, D, E). No nuclear enlargement, intranuclear or cytoplasmic inclusions were seen. Villous stroma showed reactive vascular proliferation and activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) (Figure 1 D, E). Intravillous inflammation was not detected and villous stromal karyorrhexis was only seldom seen.

Weak staining of chorionic and amniotic plates, including chorionic vessels and amnionic epithelium was also observed in the areas which overlay the most prominent subchorionic villous lesions. Decidua, including maternal vessels as well as the attached umbilical cord were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by IHC and ISH. Double staining with the mAb 001 (rabbit monoclonal) and CD68 (mouse monoclonal) antibodies demonstrated that maternal blood cells carrying the virus were CD68-positive monocytes/macrophages (Figure 2D, insert), while no double staining was observed with mAb 001 and CD15 or CD3 which label neutrophils and T-lymphocytes, respectively. EM, performed on the reprocessed FFPE tissue showed sub optimally preserved ultrastructure. Numerous round, mildly osmiophilic particles measuring 80-100 nm, consistent with virions, were identified in the cytoplasm of villous fibroblasts (Figure 2E), while ultrastructural details of trophoblastic cells were lost due to a combination of cellular necrosis and preservation/reprocessing artefacts. qRT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the samples of the villous parenchyma, placental membranes and the umbilical cord, when tested individually punched off paraffin blocks (Figure 3). The viral titer was, however, significantly higher in the villous parenchyma than in the membranes and umbilical cord (3 and 5 orders of magnitude, respectively). This correlated with IHC and ISH results showing a strong staining of STB and lack of SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in the cord, with only weak mAb 001 staining of the membranes. , the data on the effects of coronaviruses on pregnancy and placental pathology were scant with only limited observations published in the aftermath of SARS and MERS-CoV epidemics of 2002-03 and 2013-15 [16]. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, several reports described placental pathology in infected women and compared it to different control groups. Our retrospective analysis did not show statistically significant differences in the occurrences of inflammatory or vascular placental pathologies between women infected and not infected at the time of delivery. However, we detected a rare case of SARS-CoV-2 invasion of placental villous tissue associated with intervillositis in an asymptomatic woman. Previously published studies of placenta in SARS-COV-2 were also performed retrospectively and yielded somewhat conflicting results. Shanes et al [2] observed features of maternal vascular malperfusion, particularly, decidual vasculopathy, in the majority of placentas of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 and this pathology had not been associated with clinical signs of PEC. At the same time, Baergen at al [1] reported that although 11 of 20 studied placentas of infected women did not show any significant pathology, 9 remaining cases exhibited features of fetal vascular malperfusion (thrombosis and other vaso-occlusive lesions). Increased occurrences of villous agglutination and subchorionic thrombi in 51 positive cases comparing to 25 negative controls were detected by Smithgall et al",

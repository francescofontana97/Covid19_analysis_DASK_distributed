The purpose of this is to consider if there is a possibility of multiple peaks until the epidemic ends[16]. As can be seen inFig. 7, the data fits much closer with the general model of the exponential function (Equation 13) so it can be concluded that possibility to have different number of peaks to end of epidemic is negligible and exponential distribution function is the most appropriate model for forecasting the peak time.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "stands for the initial number of sensitive people who are unprotectively prone to some special diseases.

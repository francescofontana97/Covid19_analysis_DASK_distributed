The problem of how to perform student assessment in an online environment has become increasingly relevant, leading many institutions and educators to turn to online proctoring services to administer remote exams. These services employ various student monitoring methods to curb cheating, including restricted (\"lockdown\") browser modes, video/screen monitoring, local network traffic analysis, and eye tracking. In this paper, we explore the security and privacy perceptions of the student test-takers being proctored. We analyze user reviews of proctoring services' browser extensions and subsequently perform an online survey (n = 102). Our findings indicate that participants are concerned about both the amount and the personal nature of the information shared with the exam proctoring companies. However, many participants also recognize a trade-off between pandemic safety concerns and the arguably invasive means by which proctoring services ensure exam integrity. Our findings also suggest that institutional power dynamics and students' trust in their institutions may dissuade students' opposition to remote proctoring.",

Monitoring may include the use of the webcam and microphone, sharing computer screens, monitoring the network, eye tracking, or other behavioral tracking. Some services use a live (human) proctor to observe the student. While there are other mechanisms for remote examination, such as taking an exam using video conferencing (e.g., Zoom), this study is focused on remote online proctoring services that provide a more comprehensive observation using browser plugins and/or standalone software, as well as student identify verification.

Similarly, Rios and Liu also found little difference in exam performance on low-stakes exams, suggesting that rates of cheating are also similar between low-stakes proctored and non-proctored exams [30] .",

            "text": "In contrast, Daffin and Jones found that student performance was generally 10-20% higher on online psychology exams that did not use online proctoring services [6] . Goedl and Malla also found that student performance was significantly greater without online proctoring. However, like Hylton et al., they found students consistently took less time to complete their exams when proctored [8] . In these studies, it is unclear whether the differences in completion time and performance were due to (1) the online proctoring acting as a deterrent to curb cheating that would otherwise result in higher test scores or (2) a psychological effect of the presence of the remote monitoring. Woldeab and Brothen addressed this more specifically and found that for students with trait test anxiety, exam-time stress was more closely correlated with poorer performance in online proctored exams [33] . In two recent opinion articles, Coghlan et al. highlight ethical considerations when integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques into online proctoring services [3] , and Swauger opines that the algorithms that underpin online monitoring have been shown to \"[reinforce] white supremacy, sexism, ableism, and transphobia\" and that proctoring services inherit these traits [31] . These types of concerns, particularly those of online proctors' inadequate accessibility and protection of student privacy, have led to the cancellation or discontinuation of contracts with online proctoring vendors at the University of Illinois [17] and the University of California, Berkeley [1] .",

Proctoring Methods: Next, participants were asked about their level of comfort with specific monitoring methods used by proctoring services, such as eye movement tracking, video monitoring, and internet activity monitoring, and if these monitoring methods were necessary. The list of these methods were informed by the analysis of the browser extensions and privacy policies. Questions: Q17-Q28. 4. Proctoring Effectiveness: To determine the perceived effectiveness of online exam proctoring we asked if participants were less likely to cheat and if they believed it is still possible to cheat on an exam even with the monitoring methods employed by online exam proctoring services. Additionally, participants were asked if they had been accused of cheating by exam proctoring software and, if so, which specific methods such as eye movement tracking, screen recording, or internet activity monitoring was used to detect cheating.

Privacy Concerns: Participants were asked to evaluate their concern regarding sharing information with online exam proctoring companies, whether the proctoring service was a reasonable trade-off between personal privacy and the integrity of the exam, and whether online exam proctoring was a good solution for monitoring remote examinations. Questions: Q34-Q39. 6. Proctoring Software: Finally, participants were asked about the installation of exam proctoring software, what the software did, and their level of concern about the software. Questions: Q40-Q50.",

Participants predominantly did not take online proctored exams by choice but were rather required to do so by their instructors. By and large, participants have taken multiple exams with a remote proctor. At the same time, most respondents would prefer a traditional exam even while acknowledging that online exam proctoring is a good solution for remote exams. Those who think online proctoring is a good solution for remote examination as well as those who do not think proctored exams are privacy invasive are more likely to prefer online exam proctoring. We found that concern about data collection matters less than concern about monitoring methods when it comes to privacy and exam preference. Participants also largely believed that exam proctoring deters cheating, but most felt that it was still possible to cheat, particularly using a second device.",

This process may involve proof of identification via physical documentation such as IDs and other forms of identity checks that may require students to provide sensitive information to online proctoring services. Students may also be required to create accounts on these services to facilitate that process, and we find that 44 % (n = 45) of study par- ticipants were required to do just that (Q18). Participants also reported that many forms of personal information were required during account creation and before taking an exam, such as full name (n = 56; 55 %), student ID number (n = 52; 51 %), email address (n = 51; 50 %), educational institution (n = 39; 38 %), birth date (n = 29; 28 %), phone number (n = 19; 19 %), residential address (n = 16; 16 %), driver's licence number (n = 10; 10 %), and social security number (n = 7; 7 %) (Q19; see Figure 11 in Appendix B). For some participants, physical documentation was required; these included student IDs (n = 56; 55 %), driver's licenses (n = 32; 31 %), and passports (n = 7; 7 %) (Q20; see Figure 12 in Appendix B). When asked if they were concerned about sharing this kind of information with online exam proctoring companies, most participants (n = 62; 61 %) agreed (n = 38; 37 %) or strongly agreed (n = 24; 24 %) (Q34). Of those who responded with concerns (Q35), being uncomfortable sharing personal information was the most common explanation (n = 28; 27 %). For instance, P91 shared, \"I feel uneasy that in order to take an exam, I have to share personal information,\" and P45 said, \"I understand that if I opt to take a test online it needs to be fairly taken, but that doesn't mean I should open up these proctoring companies up to my home. . . \"",

Our results suggest that students understand that their educational institutions were struggling to maintain mandated safety protocols while continuing to provide academic rigor, as evidenced by the fact that a large number of study respondents (41 %) reported that online exam proctoring was a reasonable trade-off between personal privacy and exam integrity. A recurring theme in the qualitative responses was that giving up some personal privacy during the Covid-19 pandemic to maintain safety protocols was a valid reason to accept the use of online proctoring services.

These very monitoring types are those that students refer to most when they discuss how they feel that the online proctored exam can create a stressful environment, how they feel \"watched,\" and how they worry that any small sound or tiny movement-such as looking away from the screen briefly-could flag them for cheating. Students report that these additional stressors and anxieties distract them, reduce their focus, and prevent them from performing to the best of their abilities. This level of monitoring assumes cheating and pre-penalizes all students with additional stress and anxiety whether they were planning to be honest or dishonest.",

            "text": "Our work suggests that even though technologically advanced invigilation techniques are available, such as 360degree room scans and eye movement tracking, it does not mean that they are either necessary to curb cheating or sensitive to students' personal privacy and device security. Continuing to use monitoring techniques that students find unnecessary for exam integrity, while at the same time requiring students to sacrifice their personal privacy, displays a lack of trust for students and undermines students' trust in educators and institutions. Recommendation: We recommend that institutions and educators follow a principle of least monitoring by using the minimum number of monitoring types necessary, given the class size and knowledge of expected student behavior. Institutions should perform due diligence when selecting online exam proctoring companies with whom to contract, and they should take into account student privacy, student discomfort for certain monitoring types, and software installation requirements. Moreover, instructors should use caution when selecting monitoring types while setting up exams and should provide students with clear reasoning for having selected the individual methods that will be used to monitor their exams.",

These tools often include permissions to access the webcam, microphone, and web browser history. However, 43 % of students did not remove or disable the required browser extensions once they had completed their assessments. As is the case with any custom software, there is risk of vulnerabilities in these extensions. The fact that students often neglect to remove them therefore creates increased potential for harm from loss of privacy or security intrusions. Institutions should therefore be sensitive to which proctoring software they require students to install on their personal devices. Recommendation: We recommend that institutions thoroughly review common vulnerabilities and exposures of the online exam proctoring software they plan to license for installation on students' personal computers. We would also recommend that institutions limit the installation of standalone exam proctoring software to devices issued to students by the institution.",

At the same time, institutions have spent large amounts of money to obtain site license agreements for exam proctoring software. This gives the appearance of a certain amount of due diligence being applied to the purchase, while potentially increasing the barriers to student resistance towards these forms of examination.",

            "text": "Throughout our qualitative findings are statements from students of a transfer of trust between institutions who licence and faculty who support the exam proctoring software and the software itself. These students say that they believe their university would not use the software to proctor exams if it was dangerous. Moreover, they believe that their school would not have them install anything that could harm their computer or invade their privacy. Institutional support for third-party proctoring software, which conveys credibility, makes the exam proctoring software appear safer and less potentially problematic because students assume that institutions have done proper vetting of both the software and the methods employed by the proctoring services. Recommendation: We recommend that the students, along with faculty and administrators, take part in the assessment and selection of exam proctoring software. Students should be involved in every step of the process, from deciding whether to use exam proctoring software to determining which, if any, software should be used and which methods should be made available for exam monitoring.",

Offering students more choices for assessment and being upfront with students about institutional privacy norms is a crucial step to alleviate this power imbalance. Recommendation: We recommend implementing notice and choice for courses employing online exam proctoring and allowing students to consent to any monitoring that will take place during course quizzes and exams. We also recommend that syllabi include a readable privacy policy to better communicate expectations. ",

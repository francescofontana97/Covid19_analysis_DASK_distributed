However, the mechanism by which the CNS is affected is as yet unclear, and treatment approaches are not well defined. High amounts of cytokines induction by SARS-CoV (He et al., 2006) , MERS-CoV (Faure et al., 2014) , and the current COVID-19 (Huang et al., 2020) infections have been reported.

In this setting, Mehta et al.

While a case report from China presented three severely ill COVID-19 patients who benefitted from plasma exchange (Ma et al., 2020) , Keith et al. (2020) extrapolated their results from severe sepsis, and based on the hypothesis of an extreme host response with cytokine storm, advocated for a plasmapheresis trial in fulminant COVID cases. In this regard, our cases may highlight the treatment effect of plasmapheresis in COVID-19 patients with autoimmune encephalitis. Furthermore, a few key points in our series can support a cytokine storm occurring in the severely ill ICU-treated COVID-19 patients: 1) increased level of inflammatory markers, with ferritin, as a useful marker for disease severity; 2) high protein levels and albumin quotient in CSF without pleocytosis; 3) reversible MRI findings; and 4) dramatic improvement following plasmapheresis in both clinical and laboratory findings.

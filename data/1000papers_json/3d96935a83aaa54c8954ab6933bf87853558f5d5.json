Here, using an objective analytical method 2 , we present the changes that occurred in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of COVID-19, over time. The virus has mutated in three major directions, resulting in three groups to date. Analysis of the basic structure of the group of viruses was completed by April and shared across all continents. However, the virus continued to mutate independently in each country after the borders were closed. In particular, the virus mutated before the occurrence of the second and subsequent peaks. It seems that the mutations conferred higher infectivity to the virus, because of which the virus overcame previously effective protection and caused second waves of the disease.",

In fact, in the case of H1N1 influenza virus from 2001 to 2003 in the United States, the rate was 22%. This suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was under selective pressure to alter its protein structure. The viral groups causing the epidemics changed over time ( Fig. 2A) . The second and third waves in each country were caused by new variants of the virus, which showed different patterns at lower PCs (Fig. 2) . In England, the second wave was caused by a variant of the Group 0, which has since spread to many countries in Europe (Extended Data Fig. 6 , panels A-I). The third wave occurred due to another variant of Group 1, H69-V70 ( Fig. 2C) 14, 15 .",

The 2009 pandemic was subdued in this tropical country, and three peaks were subsequently identified toward 2010. At the second peak, only the nucleotide sequence changed, and at the third peak, the hemagglutinin protein changed (Table 1 ) with a high rate of missense mutations (54%). However, these changes were not highly associated with herd immunity because most of the population was not yet infected. These changes might be caused by the adaptation of pdm09-originally a swine strain-to humans. The influenza virus genome continues to mutate and not only in the part that is directly associated with infection 12 . This property may be the reason it has repeatedly deceived herd immunity for decades, allowing influenza to remain as a pandemic.",

These could have adapted to humans, but they are also conserved in various coronaviruses 20 . If they remain conserved, they could be subjected to herd immunity, extending the period between future epidemics. Evidently, this does not mean that these ORFs do not change forever; the rate of change is just slower. The strain responsible for the pandemic has mutated rapidly. As of March, the bases of PCs 1 and 2 were formed, and each continent harboured the same set of mutated variants (Fig. 1) . Since then, human movement has been restricted, and each country accumulated its own variants. In this process, the force that caused the mutations was probably adaptation to humans (Table 1) . It caused changes in both codon usage and protein structure (Extended Data Fig. 1 and 4) , but the rate of missense mutations was high (Extended Data Table 1 The unique variants in each country would serve as the source of newer variants, which are more infectious than the previous variants; therefore, they replaced the mode ( Fig. 2 and Extended Data The epidemics showed much variation among the countries (Extended Data Fig. 6) ",

In countries other than France, this strain formed second waves (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 6). In France, a Group 2 variant was prevalent at that time (Extended Data Fig. 6H); currently, this pan-European variant is spreading at a rapid rate (panel I).

International events, such as the Olympic Games, which attract people in large numbers, will serve as an exchange market for these viruses. To make matters worse, coronavirus could acquire shift-type mutations, resulting in a mixture of genomes20 . When an exported strain is mixed with a domestic strain, a new strain is created. If each of the unique mutations works independently (otherwise, replacement of the older variants with these variants would not be beneficial), the accumulation of the mutations can result in the production of more powerful viruses with cherry-picked the surviving unique mutations.",

It should be noted that Sweden, which did not enforce a lockdown, could not control the pan-European variant (panels K and L). Before this variant, the Swedish measures had worked well and the infection was avoided simply by social distancing. However, the pan-European variant was so infectious that it negated those defenses.

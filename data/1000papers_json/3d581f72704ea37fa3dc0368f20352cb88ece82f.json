For early recovery ERAS guidelines are being followed. This recommends a regular diet within 2 hours, early mobilization and urinary catheter removal immediately after caesarean delivery [4] . This mayn\u00b4t be possible for the female without assistance. 2) Shortening of the second stage of labour with elective instrumental birth, in selected cases, is being recommended for COVID-19 patients [5] . In such cases larger episiotomy is the cause of discomfort and warrants assistance. 3) Transmission of COVID-19 in breast milk has not been documented [3, 6] . The huge benefit of breast milk cannot be underestimated especially in low resource countries. Breast milk may contain protective factors after maternal COVID-19. Hence this may add to the other well established benefits of breast milk [6] . 4) The decision for separating the baby or rooming in should be taken after discussion with the patient. The benefit of temporary separation for prevention of aerosol transmission must be discussed with her in labour itself. The benefits of separation may be greater in mothers with more serious illness [6] . An assistant is essential to take care of the baby, the companion also helps in sterilising the equipment and milk expression by the mother. 5) The mental status is quite vulnerable for a mother who is suffering or is recovering from an acute illness. Nonetheless, isolation from the infant (if done) adds to the mother\u00b4s suffering, putting her at risk of developing anxiety or postpartum depression. A birth companion would support her psychologically and emotionally by listening to her, keeping her calm, empathising, helping her connect to information on her exact condition and recovery.",

During the drafting of the protocol for selection, precautions and management of birth companion, it came to light that the household to which the birth companion belonged to, formed the most significant factor. COVID-19 testing will be taken for the birth companion identified by the female, if he/she is a possible household contact (definition of contact as per WHO) [9] . The birth companion, if found positive has to be managed according to the National protocol. If an antenatal female who was diagnosed with COVID-19 earlier in pregnancy and has got a negative report before going into labor, then she is considered as a routine antenatal patient, and any asymptomatic birth Attendant can be selected [10] . Post care isolation must be considered in all birth companions. The duration may vary depending upon their symptoms, signs, clinical findings and the National protocol.",

Most of the cases of COVID-19 are asymptomatic and can be recovered before testing. 20% of the patients [14] are found to be symptomatic. Common symptoms for COVID-19 include fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, chills, fatigue, etc. But in the case of the patient suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic pneumonia, COVID-19 causes various organ collapses and also mortality. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the surface of the epithelial cells [14] are the major target area of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The density of epithelial cells is the highest in the lungs, followed by the nose, and lastly, the trachea/bronchi tissues. Thus pneumonia is quite common for COVID-19 affected patients.",

These forms of immune responses classified into two categories (lytic and nonlytic). The lytic mechanism represents the killing process of infected cells and the non-lytic effector mechanism inhibit the viral replication by soluble mediators. Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte cells (CTLs) play a pivotal role to kill infected cells, though antibodies deactivate free virus which results from the inhibition of infected cells. In this article, a COVID-19 model is constructed to study the cell-to-cell transmission of the virus. We have considered uninfected, infected epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 population, and CTL population. We have also studied the lytic and non-lytic immune responses effect on the model dynamics.",

Baleanu et al. [8] investigate a model of the COVID-19 transmission in different groups of people using the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative. They have solved the system by using the homotopy analysis transform method (HATM) and obtain approximate solutions in convergent series. Khan and Atangana [18] formulate the fractional-order mathematical model on considering cases for January 21, 2020, to January 28, 2020, and estimated the parameters of the model.

Reducing virus reproduction rate by nonlytic mechanism and increasing the death rate of infected cells by lytic mechanism is always beneficial to control the disease (Figure 3 and Figure 4 ). Our numerical findings reveal that in the presence of antiviral drug therapy the lytic and nonlytic mechanism of CTL responses acts more successfully. We also study the control-theoretic methodology in view of optimal antiviral drug dosing in our proposed system. From the fractional-order optimal control-theoretic study along with numerical findings (see Figure 5 and Figure 6 ) it is clearly observed that optimal treatment procedures can reduce the viral load and eradicate the infection. From our theoretical and numerical findings, we can predict that the lytic and nonlytic effector of the CTL responses plays a pivotal role in governing and eliminate the disease in presence of antiviral drug therapy.",

            "text": "In this article, we have revealed that the memory of cells plays a pivotal role to sustain the overall stability for long-term dynamics. It also gives us a more realistic way to reveal the viral dynamics. Thus regulating the memory of cells helps the system to explore more effectively. We have analyzed the nonnegativity and stability of the system according to the value of R 0 . Numerical simulations confirmed our analytical findings. At the same time, the optimal drug dosing into the fractional-order system plays a crucial role to reduce the viral as well as infected cell load. Hence, the FDE model is more suitable for understanding the host cell dynamics and CTL responses against viruses in comparison to the ODE system. Further, this study helps us to develop effective treatments against COVID-19 infections in order to reduce the patients' basic reproduction number to less than one. This study also leads for activation of immune response represents the main edge for reducing and eliminating viral load and infected cells from the human body.",

            "text": "Background: In March 2020, the Louisiana Department of Health activated the Medical Monitoring Station (MMS) in downtown New Orleans. This alternative care site is designed to decompress hospitals and nursing homes overwhelmed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Given the city's historic vulnerability to hurricanes, planning for possible tropical weather events has been a priority for MMS leadership. Methods: The planning process incorporated input from all sectors/agencies working at the facility, to ensure consistency and cohesion. The MMS Shelter-in-Place Plan (MSIPP) was created, and a comprehensive tabletop exercise was conducted. Results: Six planning topics emerged as a result of the planning process and were used to create a comprehensive plan for sheltering-in-place. These topics address hurricane preparedness for patient care, interfacility coordination, wrap-around services, medical logistics, essential staffing, and incident command during a shelter-in-place scenario. Conclusions: The MSIPP created by the MMS helped to maximize patient safety and continuity of operations during a real-world event. Select pieces of the plan were activated to meet the needs and threat level of Tropical Storm Cristobal. This experience reinforced the need for originality, scalability, and flexibility in building emergency operations plans in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic.",

The largest of these sites is the Medical Monitoring Station (MMS), located at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center (MCCNO). The MMS is a facility for COVID-19 positive patients who require medical monitoring and/or a facility in which to isolate. The MMS requires a referral from a health-care provider and accepts patients for transfer from other health-care settings. Acute-care hospitals, emergency departments, urgent cares, clinics, behavioral health facilities, and nursing homes are able to refer patients to the facility, which is equipped to provide basic medical care, similar to that of a medical-surgical unit of a hospital. Critical care staff, ventilators, laboratory services, and imaging are not available. Patients who deteriorate or experience medical emergencies are stabilized and transported to definitive care by onsite Emergency Medical Services (EMS).",

However, sustaining operations into hurricane season requires that the facility itself be well-prepared for tropical weather events. Since Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana's coastal communities, New Orleans included, have developed robust plans for evacuation ahead of a major hurricane. 1 However, COVID-19 is expected to complicate this practice; it is anticipated that out-of-state sheltering may be inaccessible, given New Orleans's highly publicized COVID-19 challenges and the evolving travel restrictions implemented across Southern states. Meanwhile, evacuation transportation plans are not designed for the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant increase in the quantity of vehicles would be required to evacuate citizens in a socially distant manner. The ability to shelter citizens is also impacted by the need to reduce viral spread. Shelters must prepare to implement strict infection control measures and reduce the impact of unidentified COVID-19 carriers as much as possible. These amended shelter guidelines 2 greatly reduce the capacity of previously identified evacuation shelters. Louisiana's low-lying nursing homes also plan to evacuate patients and staff ahead of storms, often directly to a partnering facility. Numerous receiving nursing homes have rescinded these agreements given their impacts during the COVID-19 emergency, leaving flood-prone facilities scrambling for alternatives as hurricane season begins.",

Medical special needs shelters are located in more northern regions of Louisiana and accommodate those with chronic medical needs during an evacuation. 4 During regular operations, the MMS accepts any patient that does not meet predefined exclusion criteria ( Figure 1 ). However, in the event of a hurricane, all incoming patients undergo individual review by a physician before being accepted, to ensure they are appropriate for the facility in a SIP scenario.

Items not typically stocked in the MMS, such as rapid sequence intubation medications, ventilators, IV pumps, and cardiac/ anticoagulant/insulin infusions are available in this area. However, the use of these medications and equipment is dependent on the ability to staff the area with clinicians qualified to provide emergency/critical care.

Because Tropical Storm Cristobal posed only a slight risk for interruption of these services, the mobile kitchen was not deployed to the MMS. However, the MMS requested and received 30,000 shelf-stable meals ahead of the storm to support staff and patients in the event emergency food was required. These meals did not accommodate the need for special medical diets. However, no emergency meals were required, as there were no interruptions in meal services during or after the storm.",

Neither plans for a hospital or a shelter cover the full breadth of emergency planning needed for the facility.

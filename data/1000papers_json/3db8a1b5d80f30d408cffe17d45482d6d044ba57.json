In the case of more contagious variants such as a strain originating from Brazil (known as P.1), the genome has 17 unique mutations, including three in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. Mutations in the S protein are thought to be responsible for the variable ability of the spike protein to bind to ACE2, and specifically, the P.1 mutant reveals increased affinity and penetration into the host. Recently, an increasing number of escape mutations in the spike protein threaten the effectiveness of vaccines [6] .",

Essential nonstructural proteins are initially expressed as two large polyproteins that are then processed into 16 peptide components. The main protease (M pro ) initially cleaves the polyproteins into 11 fragments. Inhibitors that block the catalytic M pro activity effectively interrupt the viral replication. One such inhibitor has been recently identified [7] . The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease provides a basis for the design of improved alpha-ketoamide inhibitors [7] and M pro appears to be a promising target for designing novel small molecule inhibitors. Since that original study, several promising inhibitor leads have been identified using in silico enzyme modeling [8] . Structure-based computational modeling of ligand-receptor interactions was used by Ibrahim et al. to identify potential M pro inhibitors [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Natural products hold a vital role in discovering novel and effective therapeutics to combat the present COVID-19 pandemic. Among natural products, flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids have attracted great attention as prospective SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors [14] [15] [16] . Recognizing that marine invertebrates are promising organisms for biologically active metabolites including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, antitumor, and antiviral activity [17, 18] , here biologically active terpene metabolites identified from a coral reef community unique to the Red Sea [19] were screened for in silico binding affinities against SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Previously characterized metabolites from this natural-product pool include alismol and aromadendrane sesquiterpenes derived from Litophyton arboretum [20] that exhibit inhibitory activity against the HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 PR) (IC 50 7 \u00b5M); palustrol, a sesquiterpene from Sarcophyton trocheliophorum that has antibacterial activity (MIC 6.6-11.1 \u00b5M) [21] ; and 12(S)-Hydroperoxylsarcoph-10-ene, a cembrane diterpene from Sarcophyton glaucum that was reported to exhibit potent anticancer activity via the inhibition of Cyp1A activity (p < 0.01) with IC 50 values of 2.7 nM [22] . On the basis of the predicted docking scores, the most potent inhibitors are submitted to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with binding energy calculations using a molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area approach.",

Molecular docking calculations resulted in 27 of the screened compounds exhibiting a higher binding affinity than lopinavir: an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) that was proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the basis of in vitro activity, preclinical studies, and observational studies [23] . While docking scores ranged from \u22124.3 to \u221212.3 kcal/mol, 12% of the compounds scored below \u22129.8 kcal/mol (Table S1 ). AutoDock4.2.6 software was utilized to carry out all molecular docking calculations. Binding affinities, 2D chemical structures, and features of the 27 most promising natural products towards SARS-CoV-2 M pro are summarized in Table 1 . 2D docking positions with proximal amino acid residues within the M pro active site are depicted in Figure S1 . Most of these compounds demonstrate similar M pro binding modes within the binding pocket, forming hydrogen bonds with CYS145, HIS164, and GLU166, which can account for the high binding affinities (Table 1 and Figure S1 ). The 2D and 3D representations of the interactions of the top three potent marine natural products (MNPs) and lopinavir with key amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 M pro are depicted in Figure 1 and Figure S2 , respectively.",

Therefore, those natural products with low M pro docking scores were submitted for MD simulations followed by binding energy calculations. The simulations were conducted with an implicit water solvent for 250 ps, and the molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) approach was applied to estimate the corresponding binding affinities; thereby diminishing the time and computational costs (see computational methodology section for details). The calculated MM/GBSA binding energies for the pre-screened natural products are summarized in Table S2 . Six compounds had lower binding energies (\u2206G binding ) than lopinavir (calc. \u221239.4 kcal/mol). These metabolites were further subjected to a 10 ns MD simulation in an explicit water solvent to obtain more accurate M pro binding affinities. MD/MM/GBSA binding energies were estimated (Figure 2 ). Four of these compounds exhibited lower binding energies (\u2206G binding ) compared to lopinavir (calc. No appreciable variance between the calculated MM/GBSA binding energy for the 226-M pro complex throughout the 50 ns MD simulation and the corresponding MM/GBSA binding energy throughout the 100 ns MD simulation were observed (Figure 2) . Compared with lopinavir, 226 showed a higher binding affinity towards M pro over the 100 ns MD simulation with an average \u2206G binding of \u221251.9 kcal/mol. Hydrogen bonding, pi-based, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interactions with essential amino acid residues within the M pro active site are all thought to contribute to the strong binding constant. The 2D and 3D representations for 226 and lopinavir within the M pro active site over 100 ns are shown in Figure 3 and S3, respectively. Interestingly, 226 maintained hydrogen bonding with the proximal amino acid residues of M pro over the 100 ns MD course (Figure 3 ). Structural insights into the binding mode of the 226 with the M pro demonstrated that the carbonyl groups of methyl acetates form four hydrogen bonds with the backbone imidazole of the HIS41, OH of SER146, the carbonyl group of ASN142, and NH2 of GLN189, with bond lengths of 2.72, 2.76, 3.37, and 1.89 \u00c5, respectively ( Figure 3) ; while the oxygen of the (cyclohexyloxy) cyclohexane ring forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH2 of GLN189 with a bond length of 2.62 \u00c5 (Figure 3) . Furthermore, the oxygen of tetrahydro-2Hpyran bonds with the backbone NH2 of GLN189 with a bond length of 2.06 \u00c5 (Figure 3 ). of these compounds exhibited lower binding energies (\u0394Gbinding) compared to lopinavir (calc. \u221235.4 kcal/mol). Moreover, those potent MNPs were chosen and submitted for 50 ns MD simulations in the explicit water solvent, and the corresponding binding energies were evaluated (Figure 2 ). Only erylosides B (226) exhibited steady binding throughout the simulation, while 202, 151, and 224 showed an increase in MM/GBSA binding energies over the simulated time. For instance, the calculated MM/GBSA binding energies for 226 against M pro were \u221250.8, \u221248.8 and \u221250.0 kcal/mol over 250 ps implicit-solvent MD, 10 ns explicit-solvent MD, and 50 ns explicit-solvent MD simulations, respectively. This shows the importance of long MD simulations to predict metabolite-M pro binding affinities. Therefore, MD simulations for the 226-M pro complex were prolonged to 100 ns, and the corresponding MM/GBSA binding energy was calculated (Figure 2 ). No appreciable variance between the calculated MM/GBSA binding energy for the 226-M pro complex throughout the 50 ns MD simulation and the corresponding MM/GBSA binding energy throughout the 100 ns MD simulation were observed (Figure 2) .

A Voronoi treemap of erylosides B (226) top targeted pathway affected by the top 20 gene targets in response to erylosides B (226) in terms of SARS-CoV-2 infection was constructed ( Figure  9 ). Moreover, a Reactome hierarchy map was built to provide a genome-wide representation of the pathways influenced in response to erylosides B treatment ( Figure  S4 ). Remarkably, among the top 20 enriched pathways from the Reactome-PEA analyses and signal transduction, immune system and homeostasis signaling pathways were found to be the major pathways targeted by erylosides B (226), with a high significance (FDR < 0.00001%) (Table S4 ). (Figure 9 ). Moreover, a Reactome hierarchy map was built to provide a genome-wide representation of the pathways influenced in response to erylosides B treatment ( Figure S4 ). Remarkably, among the top 20 enriched pathways from the Reactome-PEA analyses and signal transduction, immune system and homeostasis signaling pathways were found to be the major pathways targeted by erylosides B (226), with a high significance (FDR < 0.00001%) (Table S4) . GPCRs are a massive family of surface transmembrane receptors in a human cell capable of responding to numerous stimulants and promoting a cascade of cellular functions. According to the GPCRs' pharmacological attributes, they are divided into four prominent families: the rhodopsin-like receptors family, the secretin receptors family, the metabotropic glutamate/pheromone receptors family, and the frizzled receptors family [28] . Remarkably, the Reactome-PEA analyses results revealed that almost all GPCR prominent families were significantly influenced by erylosides B (Figure 10 ). Many recent studies found that SARS-CoV-2 may compromise the GPCR signaling pathway and contribute to pulmonary edema's pathophysiology [29] . Additionally, recent reports speculated that SARS-CoV-2 might hijack the GPCR signaling pathway-mimicking a previous case report in cholera toxin, ADP-ribosylation G\u03b1s-to activate CFTR and switch on Clsecretion, eventually leading to dysregulation of lung ion and fluids transmission, which ultimately led to lung edema in COVID-19 patients [30] . Interestingly, under signal transduction, it was found that the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway was the most enriched pathway influenced by erylosides B (226) treatment within the human genome. Mining of the Reactome-PEA analysis results emphasized that a set of 15 genes (OPRK1, HTR2C, PRKCA, HTR2A, ADRA1D, PRKCB, DRD2, DRD3, ADRA2A, EDNRB, ADRA1A, ADRA2B, ADRA1B, ADRA2C, and F2) were significantly modulated as biological targets to erylosides B (226) as potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor. Additionally, the Reactome-PEA results revealed that these genes were found to interact with other genes/interactors, including P16220, P52292, P00533, P12931, P07550, P35414, P01019, P30559, P14416, and O15354.",

A lack of targeted treatments has spurred the exploration of novel drug leads for which computational approaches provide a relatively quick and cost-effective approach. Herein, marine natural products isolated from the Red Sea were screened in silico as potential M pro inhibitors. On the basis of molecular docking calculations, MD simulations, and molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area binding energy calculations, erylosides B (226) demonstrated a favorable binding affinity with \u2206G binding < \u221251.0 kcal/mol with M pro . The stability of 226 complexed with M pro was confirmed using energetic and structural analyses over the 100 ns MD simulation. Ultimately, we hypothesize that the utilization of erylosides B may represent a potential therapeutic approach against COVID-19 due to its useful capability to modulate the GPCR signaling pathway in COVID-19 patients. Experimental validation is expected to further identify the suitability of natural products such as erylosides B to serve as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor.",

Moreover, those potent MNPs were chosen and submitted for 50 ns MD simulations in the explicit water solvent, and the corresponding binding energies were evaluated (Figure 2). Only erylosides B (226) exhibited steady binding throughout the simulation, while 202, 151, and 224 showed an increase in MM/GBSA binding energies over the simulated time. For instance, the calculated MM/GBSA binding energies for 226 against M pro were \u221250.8, \u221248.8 and \u221250.0 kcal/mol over 250 ps implicit-solvent MD, 10 ns explicit-solvent MD, and 50 ns explicit-solvent MD simulations, respectively.

Therefore, MD simulations for the 226-M pro complex were prolonged to 100 ns, and the corresponding MM/GBSA binding energy was calculated (Figure 2).",
